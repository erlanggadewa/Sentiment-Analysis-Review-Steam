Positive,"it is a pretty nice game, very good boss fights, excellent CGs with outstanding art. I'll give a 8.5 out of 10. We need bugs repairing and game playing optimization in future updates."
Positive,"Honestly I kept my expectations low because it seemed too good to be true especially being the first game from the studio but god damn they nailed it. The combat I would say is more akin to something like God of War rather than a soulslike. It feels great to play, very responsive, a lot of different ways to play. The graphics are fantastic and the game runs well, have not had any crashes so far."
Positive,"Beat the first boss which is the one in the trailer, the white wolf.And I have to say, so far really enjoying the game.It's basically a Chinese God of War (2018) and the Jedi Fallen series, and like those games it has some soulsborne influences, but doesn't lean too heavily into it. If you enjoyed God of War (2018) and the Jedi Fallen Order/Survivor, then you will definitely enjoy this, personally find this to be a bit more fun."
Positive,"Remember when a game was just a game? Apparently these devs do. This game is a single, complete, no nonsense game. No DLC bundles. No microtransactions, no battle passes, no live services, and no BS. Just a single game with a solid amount of content, (mostly) fair difficulty challenges, a good amount of secrets to unlock, a serviceable story, and fun gameplay. It certainly helps that Journey to the West is one of my favorite stories. Blame Dragonball Z for getting me into it. I only wish more games were like this."
Positive,"Just finished the game with all achievements and I think no words can do justice to how amazing the whole experience was. The only downside in my opinion is how many invisible walls are present around the world, but other than that; an amazing combat system, huge variety of transformations and incredible graphics. Solid game everyone should try at some point."
Positive,"So far I love everything about this game. From the story, visuals, gameplay... it's a beautiful game about chinese mythology and a rare gem of 2024. The world and visuals are stunning, although exploration is linear I want to see everything this game has to offer. This is also the first game where I chose not to play in default english, as it sounds so much better in original voice (chinese) and it makes for a more unique experience.Combat is souls inspired, but difficulty is very forgiving. There is no block/parry button, you only have to dodge attacks at the right time. Also at dying you won't loose anything, but enemies will respawn on dying and resting. This game is not hard as souls-like so noob casuals like me can give this a try. However it can still be challenging and some bosses will make you die over and over again. You can't rush in and mash buttons expecting not to die in a few hits. With that said you may have to adapt your skill points, thankfully respec doesn't cost anything so you have all the freedom to try out different abilities/playstyle.To summarize, it's an amazing singleplayer game with all the right components- interesting story, great gameplay, amazing visuals and sound effects. Optimization is very good. I can play it on my old pc (i5-7500 and GTX 1060) with a bit of tweaking. Great purchase, fantastic game! 10/10"
Positive,"(Review in progress, 8h so far, 2 chapters completed)This game surprised me more than I expected. The level of polish and care put into it is quite impressive and I absolutely loved my time with it so far. Graphics and art-design are top notch, sound design is great, music has its highs and lows, but what it doesn't lack is identity, it's pretty original. If you're familiar with the original story or Chinese mythology, you'll probably love the interpretations of characters from there, if you have no idea what is it about, prepare yourself for a wild ride, it can get quite weird, but equally amazing. Now, the main thing - gameplay. Overall I can say that it's pretty fun and I had a good time with it, especially thanks to the very decent enemy variety and non-stop bosses with their own quirks, but the only gripe that I personally have with the game - is the lack of combos, or just overall depth of core staff combat. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, however it seems like the combat's variety is leaning more towards a couple of special abilities and you waiting for them to be available again, while with the staff itself you have only one light attack combo and with that only 3 variations of heavy attacks, plus you can't cancel out of many of your animations, which is annoying in a game like this. Also most of your character progression is tied to stats improvements. I guess after playing many games like DMC series, Bayonettas, even something like recent GOW, Darksiders etc, I got spoiled with even more responsive and flexible combat systems, but other than that, I'm more than satisfied with everything else.Can I recommend it? Heck yeah! We need more single-player games like this one.Who is it for? I'd say it's a mix of a Souls-like meets GOW, but it has its own unique ideas as well.Final score (as of now) - 8.5/10 If the game manages to surprise me with something else, I'll be glad to raise the score to at least 9/10, but I'm a bit picky about some gameplay details. Still impressed though.UPD after 30 hours and almost finishing the game - I'll leave the score at 8.5 and my main points still stand. This game is impressive and it's one of the best and most solid 8/8.5 out of 10 sorta games you'll ever play, but some parts of the game outstay their welcome and combat doesn't evolve much (some people have a different opinion on this, and that's fine by me). Other than that, I loved it."
Positive,"After beating the game twice and seeing both endings, I can finally give it my personal assessment. This review contains spoilers and a considerable amount of bias, so take it with a grain of salt.It's an easy 9, or even 10, for me. With a triple-A budget pair with UE5, the graphical fidelity is impressive. While some have pointed out that stock assets are used to paint the environment, I honestly don't mind that much as long as they blend in well. Chapters 1 to 3 probably have the most distinguished biomes and stunning architecture. IIRC, the team 3D mapped a bunch of historical buildings and reconstructed them in-game. This approach is a breath of fresh air after playing Western AAA games for so many years. The animated mini-series from each chapter is also surprisingly well-made and unexpected; it gives the game a such unique character in terms of art direction.For those who have never read the classic Journey to the West, the plot might seem puzzling and confusing. I don't blame you; the narrative is scattered all over the place, and each chapter could be its own standalone story. For those who actually read the classic novel, the plot is just as baffling as everyone else. In fact, the world setting is only partially based on the original work. Black Myth's team has taken creative liberties to reinterpret Journey to the West based on another modern novel named ""Wu Kong"" and their previous Journey to the West MMO. The tone is much darker, the writing is edgier, and the underlying message is up to you to interpret. I only hope they can come up with a more coherent plot that stitches all the chapters together.For this section, I might need to break it into two parts: the Monkey itself and the rest of the mobs. The destined one has a very limited move set. Some weapons have their own variants added to the basic attack, but that's about all you get. The combat mechanic is relatively shallow and gets repetitive fast. There are some builds that synergize certain spirits with your gears, but the variety is still lackluster. On the contrary, I much prefer the enemy diversity. Although some re-skins exist, most still have their own move set and animation. There are a total of 55 mini-bosses and 26 bosses, which brings the total to 81. This odd number may not be apparent to some, but in the JttW novel, this is the exact number of tribulations they must endure to retrieve the scriptures. Interestingly, 81 is also the number of achievements on the PC end. I'm absolutely fond of the last fight with WuKong, with Erlang coming in a close second. Everyone and their mother has watched the 86 JttW TV series in China, and the amount of love and homage they put into the final battle is off the charts. This battle alone carries the entire Chapter 6, considering how bland the level design is otherwise. I couldn't think of a better boss fight in recent years. Yes, as I said before, I'm incredibly biased on this; the nostalgia hits differently.In its current state, I give it an 8.5. It is an excellent entry as their first AAA title. Although it has its flaws, a good game doesn't necessarily excel in every single aspect. The storytelling could be better because it doesn't complement how great the art direction is. At the same time, if they intend to create a semi-boss rush ARPG, I hope they can iron out the invisible walls in both level design and during combat, along with more in-depth combat mechanics to ensure both elements complement each other."
Positive,"IF YOU ARE HAVING ISSUES WITH LOADING SHADERS/CRASHING/STUTTERING!Open Launch Options in your library and put -dx12  and launch using the games Compatibility Mode. This is what allowed me to compile the shaders and actually play the game! I'm running on a RTX 3070 8GB VRAM, WD BLACK SSD and 32GB RAM. Hope this helps! #Monke"
Positive,"Visually stunning. Despite saying better on a controller, I actually like the gameplay on my mouse and keyboard. I'm not usually into this type of genre often but I am very much enjoying the story and especially the visuals. PURE EYE CANDY. Running on a 4080 Super @ 3440x1440 I'm getting a steady 60-80 fps with graphics set to 'cinematic', the highest it goes with RT set to High. No crashing or issues seen yet detected and game is running smoooth as butter."
Positive,"Yes I'm aware that my thumbs up is never going to be seen by anyone. There is literally thousands of them. But what I'm NOT seeing is people actually talking about the game. At least at time of writing. Most people are talking about how good it looks, or how well it plays. Or vice versa. But no one talking about what the game is like. Or how it feels to play it. Is it worth my fricken money???Well let me help with that. Yes it's worth the money.It's a souls-like game despite it not having that tag on the steam store page. It plays similar to Jedi Fallen Order or God of War or Darksiders. It's a linear action game where if you die you go back to a resting point. If you rest at said resting point all enemies respawn as does your healing items. However unlike Dark Souls or Elden Ring you don't lose experience points, money or items when you die.But yes, the production value in this game is off the charts. It looks even more beautiful then it does on the steam store page. It sounds beautiful too. The gameplay is also fun, fluid and engaging. There's so much done right about this game that I hate to talk about whats wrong with it.For instance the tutorial is severely lacking. Barely teaches you anything. Or how there's little to no direction in the game. Unless i'm severely missing something. But After the first hour I was absolutely, completely. 100 percent lost. No idea where to go or what to do. The game is lacking in direction in pretty much every single definition of the word and I actually hate that.But if you can find your own way, don't mind really hard games and don't mind a character with no character or a plot with no plot then this game does everything else 110 percent perfect.So let that be your deciding factor I guess. I mean 60 dollars is still a lot of money, just know what you're getting into. But if this genre is what you're looking for then it's worth the money.If you'd like a more in-depth look at the game and what not feel free to check out my review on my YouTube Channel (link below).Otherwise, thanks so much for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there spend your money wisely."
Positive,"This is what peak gaming looks like ladies and gentlemen... Remember, Reject humanity, embrace Monke!"
Positive,"The game devs have said many times this is not a souls-like, I corrected people many times to tell them it is not a souls-like. Turns out that yeah, I think it is very much a souls-like. Right off I think this is going to create a problem for a lot of buyers who likely were expecting an ""action RPG"" as while it certainly does have some of those characteristics, make no mistake, this is a very difficult game at times. The combat is definitely souls inspired though it is quite unique in some ways, as there is effectively no base blocking mechanic but rather you basically build up energy to unleash heavier attacks and you can do so via dodging perfectly or many basic hits on an enemy (to put it simply). At first as a souls enjoyer I struggled to understand what they were expecting and the combat initially felt clumsy and not at all tight. But once you lock in and start learning how to perfectly dodge, there is nothing more satisfying than pulling off multiple perfect dodges back to back, with a very satisfying audio and visual effect to indicate you did pull off a perfect dodge. But it took me hours of dying to the first 'boss' (Wandering Wight) to finally realise the combat is fast, punishing but immensely satisfying and I think that is being overlooked with all the drama surrounding the game. That being said, I would have loved a ranged option to deal with the very annoying archers that appear regularly and for a monkey man, he seems to have a distinct lack of climbing ability which seems a bit oddOn that note, we all probably know the premise of the story and it is presented beautifully, if slightly confusing if you are unfamiliar with the source material. The Chinese mythological setting of the game is not something I have played in often if at all, so it makes for an interesting and original setting for me and the fact it is absolutely beautiful and atmospheric is just icing on the cake here. They have created some full AAA quality cutscenes to move along telling the story and they feel not unlike the grand cutscenes in God of War in scope and quality, they really have done a great job here in my opinion. The world is absolutely beautiful with a very distinct Unreal 5 look to it, though it is very linear with some limited exploration to be had but you will often find an invisible wall stopping you from venturing off the trail and they maybe could have been a bit more creative with how they keep you in the limits of the map without just straight up invisible walls but for me this is just a minor complaint. Sound is great and of course the graphics are stunning, though of course with the caveat that this is an Unreal 5 game and it uses all the latest visual fluff, so don't think you're going to max this out on your GTX 1050 and have good time. But it scales well and if you follow guides like the Hardware Unboxed optimisation guide you should be able to get it running well on very modest hardware. In summary I think this is one game that surprisingly lived up to the hype, while it isn't perfect I think overall these guys have done an amazing job for their first big release and it could very well end up being one of the top games of this year. I think a big thing to understand as a potential buyer going into this game, is that it is VERY difficult at times and this I am sure is going to catch a lot of people out as an unpleasant surprise."
Positive,"This game is based on the novel Journey to the West. Sun Wukong is the main protagonist of that journey, and I would advise watching some summary before playing the game, to understand how insane he is and what he did. He was also an inspiration for Goku. I didn't tag this game as Souls-like because I don't think it is. When you die, you don't lose ""souls"". Lore is way more detailed and not as hidden as in Souls games where you need to read item descriptions and listen to NPCs. Here most of the lore is found by just killing new enemies which unlock new entry in the journal. There are no stats like strength, dexterity etc. instead you have skill trees with so many things to upgrade. Also if you explore everything this game will be easier than Souls games most of the time. Black Myth: Wukong is the game on its own, the epic game for itself.The first thing you can notice when you start this game is that in only a few seconds you are greeted by some colossal beings. I was amazed as soon as the game started, and the prologue itself is absolutely incredible. Slight spoiler, but in prologue you play as Sun Wukong, and after that game is divided into 6 chapters, where you are playing as Destined One years later trying to ""wake up"" Sun Wukong. Every time you kill a new enemy you will get some journal entry, which is a short story which has references to the Chinese folklore or Journey to the West, and reading these stories is necessary to understand the story. Sometimes I had to google, because the names were not explained. These stories are also usually very interesting, but there are so many of them so I would advise on reading them as soon as you get them, cause they can pile up. There are around 200 in total and some of them are connected where story continues from one entry to another.The story itself is pretty interesting, and there are a lot of amazing cutscenes. Each of the first 5 chapters features a new story set in some new world. Each of these chapters has some main ""villain"" that you need to beat to get the rune.When I first started playing this game, after overwhelming prologue, chapter 1 felt a bit rushed and kinda underwhelming, because if you don't read those journal entries the whole chapter will feel like the boss rush, but after some time I started liking it. Chapter 2 is definitely way bigger and opens way more, however it's a big desert, so it can get tiring. Chapter 3 is where things got very interesting and very confusing, because it is so big, and it branches so much. At first it felt okay, but then I reached a big forest with snow everywhere, and everything looked similar, you could go anywhere, like in 15 directions. Thankfully with those journal entries you can see if you missed something. And when I was done with this forest there was some temple area, which as well was really really big, and had so much going on, that the whole chapter was very confusing, even though it was very interesting story-wise. It is also the longest chapter in the game. Chapter 4 is also very long and it is probably one of the best when it comes to story, but it is a bit gloomy. Chapter 5 was kinda short, and it was mostly fighting bosses, but it was as well a pretty interesting chapter with interesting story line. Chapter 6 is very different from all other chapters, you are just going around and searching for some bosses, trying to find some items before fighting the final boss.The first 5 chapters also feature secret areas which I would advise beating, since most of the time they will make the end boss of the chapter much easier with some new item that you got, and they are also very interesting. The game also features 2 endings, and to get true ending you will need to beat all these secret areas.Throughout the game there are so many bosses and mini-bosses to beat, I think I have beaten over 100 of them, but I definitely beat them all since I got all journal entries in the game. Most of these bosses took me few tries most, and a lot of them can actually be considered mini-bosses, and those mini-bosses sometimes leave spirits which you can collect and summon later while fighting. It can be a bit overwhelming to fight bosses all the time, but eventually I got used to it, and since I mostly beat them all on first or second try, it felt like fighting regular enemies eventually. The problem with fighting so many bosses is that rarely any boss will be memorable. If you explore everything and you are ""good"" at Souls games you will not have problems with this game. Only one boss in this game which is necessary to beat to get true ending took me a lot of tries, I think I needed a few hours. Boss is so epic and hard, and in my personal experience it's 2nd hardest boss from all bosses I've ever fought including all Souls games.Combat is just incredible, it's so fun, one of the best I have seen. Destined One is wielding staff so fast, and he is so fast that you can just dodge anything and you need to dodge all the time. You also need to make the best use of spells that you get through the game. One spell will let you freeze the enemy for few seconds. One spell will make duplicates of you for few seconds which help you fight. I mentioned already that you will be able to call spirits, and you will also be able to transform. Transformations regenerate over time, as well as spirits (when you fight you get KI which regenerates spirits), but spells cost mana, and until you rest again at shrine you will not get mana back, so prepare to become good with your staff. Overall combat is just amazing, incredibly fun.In addition to combat, there are shrines on which you can rest, fast travel etc., and while fighting you earn skill points which you can use to upgrade your abilities. You can also restart these abilities at any point on any shrine. You can travel from chapter to chapter at any point in the story. You can also craft armor and staff that you get from fighting bosses, and use some items to help you make game easier.Game took me around ~65h to beat all bosses, get all journal entries and get most of the achievements. You can't get all achievements in the first run, so you must play ng+ for the rest of them, however ng+ is pretty easy. Only problem is that some achievements require farming. There aren't many NPCs side quests, but there a lot of characters. Performance wise a lot of people complain, and I also had issues which I fixed by using FSR instead of DLSS and frame generation on. I managed to get my game running completelly smooth, stutter free, but I had insane stutter at first.- One of the best openings in the games I've ever seen- Incredibly fun combat- Journal entries are so interesting- Cutscenes are amazing- Most bosses are unique, and there are many good bosses- Pretty good story and everything about Sun Wukong is so interesting- Chapter 3 can be a bit confusing to explore, it can feel like it's easy to miss stuff, but on the other hand chapter itself is really interesting- Chapter 6 introduces new ability, but it also feels so random, just searching for bosses- Having to search the internet for explanation of some characters that are not in the game Just an incredible game, my personal GOTY of the 2024 so far, and of the best and most fun games I've ever played. I liked it so much that I ordered The Journey to the West books. This is definitely one of the best games I've ever played and one of my new favorite games, and I felt so overwhelmed when I finished it. I would advise getting true ending, cause it's worth it. If chapters 3 and 6 had a bit better design I would consider this game a masterpiece, but it's really close.Note: This explains how I rate games in my reviews. https://imgur.com/s7VB3Vj"
Positive,"The game itself is nothing unique, but its done so well that it feels like it is. I was having fun with the game right away, but really when i hit chapter 2 i was freaking hooked. Something about the lore, the story telling, the relatively deep RPG elements, the combat - it just feels so damn fun to play. Im half way through the game at the time of writing this review, but its just so much fun i had to add to the good vibes online for the game. THAT being said, does it drive anyone else crazy that the game doesn't have any terrain climbing mechanics? I know thats typical for a ""souls like"" game, but dude COME ON you are a Monkey king and you cant even climb a rock or a tree?!? - maybe in the sequel lol"
Positive,the game is huge! and the cool part is the fact that you get the feeling the game is not ending anytime soon! make sure to explore the entire region fully and listen to all the npc cuz its important everyone has role! that might give you skill/armor/key item etc... and i will 100% recommend players who played elden ring/sekiro/soul games to play this game! it was amazing and i cant wait for them to add more things in game with dlc and etc

Positive,"For the last couple of weeks, I've been brushing up on my Journey to the West knowledge, not least because of its obvious surge in relevance, but also its status as one of the most influential written works of all time, its presence inescapable across a whole host of modern media. From its episodic, monster-of-the-week structure to the rambunctious and hilariously overpowered Sun Wukong, it might as well be the original shonen anime and, the more I read, the more impossible its massive reach becomes to ignore.Game Science's take on the classic novel is not the typical homage or adaptation, but rather something of a follow-up, opening with the Monkey King, wholly disinterested in the Buddhahood awarded to him at the end of the titular journey, clashing in the clouds with the forces of Heaven, themselves quite unable to trust the innocence in the chronically mischievous Wukong's return to a simple, earthly life. Overwhelmed and stricken down, you pick up some five hundred years later as the Destined One, an auspicious monkey tasked with retrieving the scattered relics of the defeated Great Sage, their unification capable of returning him once more to the land of the living.It's something of a retelling, too, with each of the six largely stand-alone chapters transporting the Destined One to destinations from the original journey, complete with their assorted villains and supporting casts. It's an approach those intimately familiar with the source material will no doubt appreciate; however, it's a narrative heavily reliant on pre-existing knowledge of those destinations, villains and supporting casts and, in tandem with a frustrating aversion to almost all forms of exposition, subtle or otherwise, I seriously struggle to see those new to Chinese myth following anything but the broadest strokes.Myself included, to an extent (the version of the book I'm familiar with isn't a complete translation), yet the less I understood, the more I realised how little it ultimately mattered. Each chapter concludes with an unbelievably gorgeous and expertly scored five or so-minute animation rendered in an entirely different style and format than the last, and while I won't hesitate to admit a fair amount of the little details and references soared cleanly over my head, the passion, care and unwavering reverence for the source material is utterly unmistakeable. Coupled with meticulous, striking enemy design and truly breathtaking scenery, there's a profound artistry in every corner of Black Myth's composition, so much more than just a plot to get wrapped up in, and any concerns of missing context quickly fall by the wayside.These days, it's hard to find a single third-person action game that doesn't in some way fall victim to the soulslike allegations, and Black Myth is no exception, the bulk of critics veritably frothing at the mouth at the slightest possibility something might be treading even a fraction of Miyazaki's illustrious path. However, with a stark emphasis on combo building, active abilities and a gargantuan skill tree, the Destined One's moveset strikes me as much more Nioh (another soulslike, I know, despite its combat being anything but) than anything else, with much of the feel of modern God of War and all the style of character action.It's a lot more empowering than the typical Souls model, too: among the smattering of spells you'll eventually get your monkey paws on, one of the early ones is functionally little more than a simple evade and counter, but the dramatic swoosh of the initial dodge, the blinding speed of the re-engage, and the punchy slow-mo of the following punish result in a move far more thrilling than any basic description might suggest. The rest of the kit is similarly flamboyant; you're generally stuck with just the Monkey King's classic staff throughout, but you've got a few different stances switching up its heavy attack, each making full and bombastic use of the weapon's iconic shape-shifting capabilities.Alongside an almost gratuitously twirly light attack combo culminating in a powerful overhead slam, rounding out the Destined One's combat prowess are the yaoguai transfigurations: one an equipable spirit allowing you to take the form of a fallen foe just long enough to bust out their signature move, the other a considerably more rare, complete transformation, equipped with a full moveset, a separate health bar, and lasting a fair bit longer than the spiritual counterpart.All told, you're left with a fast, meaty, and strategic combat model defined by a vast arsenal of abilities, all capable of turning the tide of battle in an instant and tested in a tremendous variety of boss encounters. While a few too many of these epic clashes have a bad habit of prioritising spectacle over clarity, these battles are otherwise brilliantly designed, creatively rich, and the centrepiece of the Black Myth experience, an almost always entirely unique encounter around every corner.Of course, with combat this tight and inherently well-designed, the cracks are increasingly more obvious; in this case, unfortunately, a myriad of technical shortcomings. Between strikes not tracking properly, bosses launching entire combos in entirely the wrong direction, the camera completely losing its mind, bizarre hitboxes, and a whole smorgasbord of other smaller issues, It's tough to recall a single major fight that wasn't at least slightly soured by one of my big attacks randomly whiffing at a crucial moment or a spell failing to work as intended, yet still going on a lengthy cooldown regardless.There's no immunity to dubious design, either, particularly progression-side: most of the skill tree is superb, offering just about every improvement you could ever want for every aspect of the Destined One's moveset; however, you'll also find the bulk of your base stat increases taking all the same space, and the ensuing tug of war is a real early-game pain, your limited skill points forced not into what you want more, but rather what you can live without. Armour sets are equally questionable, boasting incredibly specific, build-defining set bonuses, but no way to upgrade and bring them with you until at least halfway through the game for no good reason.It's a similar story with exploration: between the visual splendour, the open, sweeping level design, and all the secrets and hidden nooks, it leaves quite the first impression, but the longer you spend in these spaces, the trickier it becomes to overlook their weaknesses, crude invisible walls everywhere you look, even more completely harmless yet agonisingly spongy enemies, all underpinned by a bizarre, stifling lack of a map. The main draw is ultimately the generally excellent range of optional side content—tonnes of extra bosses, little quests unlocking a new vendor or spell, and an utterly spellbinding secret ending, to name a few. They're sometimes a little too cryptic for their own good, but they're all very worth your time; each chapter has one chunkier side quest culminating in a whole additional sub-area and often a Vessel, an equipable active item primarily designed to counter the same chapter's final boss in immensely satisfying fashion.While I'm certainly painting a somewhat less euphoric picture than many of the other writings in this here review section, Black Myth Wukong's electrifying combat, its larger-than-life boss encounters, and the unbridled passion from the team behind it make for a title I strongly recommend.Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews, to see more high quality reviews regularly."
Positive,"There is exactly zero chance this is the review that makes you buy this game considering there are a quarter-million similar endorsements, but: This game definitely goes on the top games of all time list...right near the top alongside Witcher Wild Hunt, BG3. and Ghost of Tsushima.  It isn't ""perfect in every way""; but what it does well, it does better than most before it and resets several bars in terms of expectations for games going forward.  Its graphics, its fluidity in movement; its animations; its level design; its bosses...all top-notch.  It is absolutely NOT a souls-like.  It has a few elements of what makes soulslikes great; but leaves out the frustrating parts. It acknowledges that it is already a tough game and doesn't further burden the player with the tedious punishments that some of us souls-like-fatigued have become accustomed to tolerating:- No hunting down souls dropped- No min/maxing builds based on a subset of weapon types- fewer punishing second-phase fightsMay seem like a short list, but the lack of that ""Holy crap, I hate this game...I can't believe I just grinded through this entire level for the past hour only to get one-shotted and lost all my progress"" feeling.As many other players have noted, this game is far closer to GOW.  My favorite description I read so far was: ""It's like God Of War, Ghost of Tsushima, and Elden Ring had a threesome and nobody knows who the father is.""Cons (short list):- invisible walls are especially noticeable in the first chapter.  Annoying to see something that looks like a cave, but hit an invisible wall five feet in front of it.- A noticeable halo effect caused by what appears to be post-processing setting. Toning that down made a good improvement.- some heavy granular effects by what I assume is some graphics setting in either post-processing.- Not sure if the ""FSR"" is FSR3...also, we can't completely turn off the FSR/DLSS apparently...it looks like we can only set it to quality and up the resolution limit to 100%.  It would be nice to be able to turn it off; even if it is only for a comparison.  But aside from those very minor nitpicks, this game is an all-time-top-tier-absolutely fabulous game and I HOPE MAJOR GAME STUDIOS WILL SEE HOW SUCCESSFUL THIS IS AND FOLLOW THEIR LEAD!!!More of this type of game: Complete; functional on launch; great writing; great characters; outstanding graphics and gameplay...NO MICROTRANSACTIONS...Buy it. It is worth it and then some."
Positive,"Absolute banger. Challenging boss fights, incredible music, beautiful art. Only downside is I wish there’s a in game map, I get lost all the time and lost track of where I’m supposed to go."

Positive,"For me, this is one of the best games in history! This game is proof that a project doesn't need battle passes, paid cosmetics, or in-game shops to be successful. This is probably one of the most passionate games released in the past decade; the creativity and attention to detail are absolutely insane.Starting with one of the top selling points: the graphics. The graphics are absolutely absurd; Unreal Engine 5 is the best-looking engine on the market as of 2024, and this game makes very good use of it. Yes, using UE5 means that the game sometimes has some high optimization problems, although they're minor compared to other UE5 titles released recently.The combat and enemy variety in this game are simply absurd. Elden Ring is an amazing game, and even a game of that caliber still struggles to keep up with this game variety-wise. Every single enemy in this game is unique and original, with highly detailed models and movesets; there's only a very small amount of reused assets among the enemies and bosses. Some of the boss fights are creative enough to make your jaw drop. The game has a lot of different skills and movesets, transformations, and items to make the combat feel unique in each encounter. Although I gotta admit that I wish it had more spells.The biggest problem with this game compared to other action games is definitely the limitations on exploration of the map. This game has an absurd amount of invisible walls and limitations on the terrain blocking exploration, sometimes even on clear paths that look like they'd be explorable otherwise. And this is the reason i'm not giving this game a 10/10.The soundtrack fits very well with the theme of the game; the OSTs are magical and epic. Each chapter has an animation at the end with different art styles and music, with different stories and meanings. For a person who is not used to the main theme portrayed in this game, it's a magical experience for sure...I would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in Chinese folklore and mythology. The story is amazing; I was totally unfamiliar with anything related to this theme, and after playing it, I gotta say I really want to know more about the general theme and meaning behind these stories.I genuinely believe this game will be remembered throughout the years as one of the most passionate and successful projects in gaming history."
Positive,"Story, gameplay, music, graphics... just awesome! Didin't expect to see such a good game these days anymore.  I love it. Truly a masterpiece!"
Positive,This game is about ape
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong was released under a lot of anticipation after gameplay showcases had been shown over the past few years, leading people to even question if the game would really come out like that. Thankfully, it really did – and overcame all expectations. The game is engaging, well made, fluid, has a fair dose of difficulty, is downright beautiful and is worth every penny and time you put into it.I honestly find it hard to catch up with the story – at least without any knowledge on the classical Chinese novel The Journey To The West, where the developers have taken inspiration from. Still, that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the game, especially during a second playthrough.The game isn’t the classical novel itself, but inspired by it. It’s set after Sun Wukong’s disappearance/death after his fight against the Celestial Court – event that serves as a prologue. You play as a monkey warrior referred to as The Destined One, who journeys through the land to recover Sun Wukong’s six relics, which were scattered across the land, in order to try to bring the famous monkey back to life.It feels amazing! Black Myth: Wukong is a third person game that you can label under the soulslike banner. However, that doesn’t mean it has an excruciating difficulty. It’s more of a friendly soulslike with some elements of hack and slash – enemies are usually difficult, bosses are challenging, but you won’t lose anything if you die. It might take you some time to beat some bosses, but you eventually end up succeeding. The more you venture into the game, the better you get because you are earned more resources to fight, as well as you get naturally better at playing it. There practically aren’t hordes of enemies like in a hack and slash game, so you won’t be swarmed.A magical iron staff is your main weapon, but there are also magical skills, transformations, three difference stances, potions to temporarily enhance your abilities and a skill tree to spend your points on according to your playstyle. There won’t be enough points (sparks) to buy all abilities, so be wise and understand what your playstyle is and don’t waste sparks on things you don’t use – although it’s possible to reattribute them.Among the things that make this game appealing is the fluid combat. It’s not sluggish, floaty and clunky as most soulslike games. The movements are beautiful and fast-paced, satisfying to perform. And the bosses hardly ever have the same movements. They are pretty much all unique, which adds to the game. So you don’t feel you are facing a repetition of a previous boss under new skin, except for the elemental frogs.Black Myth: Wukong is a ‘new’ generation game like no other. It features the best and most advanced technologies out there, and applies them very well. It’s not a poorly optimized game – it indeed is a heavy one. But even if you lower the presets, you are still going to have a beautiful game.The game doesn’t survive on good graphics alone. I could say it’s absolutely one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played. The details in the scenarios, the architecture, the clothes, the weapons, with all the rich Chinese ornamentations… how well detailed the enemies are when it comes to appearance, movements, attacks… how varied everything is… You can spend a lot of time just gazing at details, which contributes a lot to your immersion. Well, I could spend all day long listing how incredible the details are. Game Science didn’t have any laziness.Of course, there are flaws. The game is so incredible to the point that the flaws aren’t a deal breaker, but they’re so silly they shouldn’t be there.The most alarming of all are the invisible walls. Wukong is full of them, even at unnecessary places! We’re not talking about a totally linear game – there are areas of (semi) open world. It means there shouldn’t be invisible walls, even inside monk temples where you could walk to the temple wall. But you can’t because there’s another invisible wall before it. When it happens, it breaks the immersion a little bit.Another grave one is the simply terrible lip sync. That disturbs our enjoyment a lot if we pay attention to it rather than notice other graphical elements. That's why I stopped looking at their mouths and began admiring the rest. They haven't used any AI to lip sync with English, so the English voiceover doesn't match the Chinese lip movements. Embarrassing.Also, some lighting issues sometimes occur. When you walk into a new area, for instance, you may experience light sources changing, just popping from dark to clear sunlight all of a sudden, like inside some caves or other places in the desert.I’ve also experienced enemies, NPCs and other elements popping in front of me in the scenarios, less frequently though. Maybe it could have been due to hours of session straight.At least three or four times, I was forced to close the game and rerun it after some lags and huge fps drops – also after long hours of gameplay straight. You see, I got 32GB RAM, but maybe the game uses it so much that the memories are unable to erase unnecessary information. But, rerunning the game always fixed it.It’s not any game that has some flaws yet its strengths eclipse them. The flaws don’t ruin your experience, and you definitely should play this game. Wukong is one of those games you can’t miss and will make you have an unforgettable experience.Black Myth: Wukong is not groundbreaking, it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but proves that if devs really want to create a game with competence and passion – and above all, a game that is supposed to be what it is: a videogame! –, they deliver wonderful experiences.The price tag is fair for such a masterpiece. You don’t need to wait for sales. Grab it!"

Positive,"Unexpected MasterpieceThis is probably a blueprint on how to make GOD-based mythology action game. Versatility is their Core yet many games in similar ""God-based"" Epic tend to be more human-like ( God of War )Still on chapter 3 and am already level 54 and 60 is max level ( after reaching level 74 there's no level cap because Gods don't need caps lol ) . This game does everything right I cannot recommend enough. Story is very motivational despite not having to know much in chinese mythology. This gameplay loop and ease of respec-ing the character at any time without cost are how GODS/Demi Gods should be portrayed. They're All-rounders and they pick & choose every single asset with ""need of application"" in mind. I love how everything has multiple skill-build based attribute. TLDR.easy 9.5-10/10 after reaching chapter 6 and doing almost all secret bosses this is bare minimum 10/10. lol"
Positive,"Game really lives up to the hype. Stunning graphics and smooth combat. Skill tree resets are free and you keep everything after death, so you’re free to experiment with builds. Took a risk and played it on steam deck with default settings, and was surprised it works for the most part. Saw a bit of lag after respawning 10+ times in the same area, which was fixed after a restart of the game, but 0 crashes so far (I’m 2 bosses in currently)."
Positive,"Might be the first time where negative reviews actually made me buy a game. No open world Great—Not every game needs to have an open, fully explorable world. I'd much rather have a linear experience in beautifully crafted environments, which this game has. Honestly, there's much exploring to do, and it's always worthwhile. No map! I would never have expected this to be an actual complaint. This game gives me flashbacks to the late '90s and early 2000s, where you actually play a game and don't get directions spoon-fed. You have to use your eyes and recognize where you've been and where you can still go. It's what makes exploration fun and worthwhile. Backtracking through areas to see if you missed anything. It's an endless boss rush, kill a few mobs and the next boss is in sight Again—How is this a negative? The boss fights are the reason we play this genre of games. I'm amazed at how much love and attention has been put into each boss. They all have gorgeous visuals and fun, engaging movesets. No diversity and inclusion! I find diversity, equality, and inclusion important topics. However, not every game needs it. Some games have a good place and fit for it, like Baldur's Gate 3, which does it very well. However, this is a mythological game where you play as a monkey and beat up rats, lizards, and the like.This is one of the few games in the last few years where I'm having a blast playing. It feels like a mix between God of War and Monster Hunter in a Souls-like sauce. The game is hard enough to be challenging but easy enough to craft your own build without googling for strong and effective builds."
Positive,"Im Chinese but Im using English so I hope there gonna be helps for some player outside of China. This game is NOT as good as God of war, Sekiro, or Devil may cry, for sure. BUT it has never intends to be yet it is still good enough to make your moeny worth spending. You dont need to be well aware of any Chinese old customs or traditional stories to play this game. Chinese people didn't stop playing Greek story game for lacking the background knowleage. The game speak for himself(or herself). And if you are really concerned about the political right kinda stuff apear in this game, it might disappoint you. It doesn't have black or white people,or lgbtq+ people, but for the very least, there ARE wolves and elephant and dogs and frog people in it so consider is DIVERSIFIED enough. Welcome to play this game and learn more about Wukong."
Positive,"Imagine coming home after a long 9-to-5, ready to unwind, and Steam download of this game is finished. You said, ""I’ve never played a Souls-like game before—how hard can it be? It can't be that bad, right?""Wrong.This game delivers a masterclass in getting your ass whooped. Expect zero handholding—no map, no mission tracker, and constant threat of getting ganged up by random yaoguais. And just when you think you're getting the hang of it, you find out that farming licorice can randomly drop… a goat skull. Yeah, wrap your head around that one.It's like dating a dominatrix. It's stunning—seriously, the visuals are gorgeous—but it’s going to torment you.Despite being a first-timer in this genre, getting wrecked repeatedly, I found myself oddly committed—to the challenge, to its captivating lore, to the game itself. I laughed, I cried, I raged, and I teetered on the brink of uninstalling this game more times than I can count.But after countless gruelling hours, unlocking the secret ending, rerunning New Game+, I finally got that Final Fulfillment achievement. Now, at long last, I can uninstall this tormenting masterpiece with peace..."
Positive,"A very ambitious, refreshing action-RPG that focuses on cinematic action and hyper dynamic combat while doing away with the usual open world fluff that has gotten way out of control since the mid 2010's.Its a little linear, cut in straightforward chapters and contained areas, almost in a retro / nostalgic way, but it really doesn't miss a beat thanks to stunning, epic cutscenes and frenetic, unique boss fights, constantly pushing the player forwards through the chapters, yearning for more.  Sometimes pushing a little too far ahead, to the detriment of the story while at other times offering up some incredible characters and lore along with touching moments... And lots of research to do on Journey to the West and Chinese mythology.Combat is speedy and dynamic although quite precise and usually pretty clean / readable. It sometimes turns messy because of weird camera movements and even weirder hitboxes. A somewhat uneven localisation (at least in English)  and a frustrating amount of invisible walls. Definitely old-school .It's spent a long time cooking and ultimately feels like a great first step in Chinese AAA gaming."
Positive,"I played 9 hours but 4 were offline so I think it will say I played 5 hours, I didn't beat the game, yet I still made this comprehensive review to explain the core aspects of the game and it's quality. This review uses my own experience and those of my friends who got ahead in the game. I am 30 years old, and I don't enjoy souls likes anymore in the long term. Still, I did my review objectively and I think you might find it useful. Cheers!~Black Myth Wukong is a soul-like game that adds some interesting elements to the genre by incorporating new ideas into its gameplay through the legendary tale of Sun Wukong. Players can transform into bosses they defeated before (with some limitations), and Wukong's tricks are plenty. They can range from transforming into rock to making multiple clones of themselves or freezing foes in place, unable to move or fight back.The player will explore the tale of the legendary monkey king while fighting challenging bosses and recovering the artifacts of Wukong. The game starts easy but rapidly reaches difficulty levels of your most popular soul games, requiring skill, strategy, and wits to defeat fearsome foes. If there is something people hear about this game, it is two things: transforming into bosses and ray tracing. The ray tracing of the game looks beautiful, as reflections and environments look superb on the screen. The requirements are quite bulky, as I used an RTX 4070 Super and could either go 2k with Ray Tracing at medium with settings on very high for 70-90 FPS or 4k with no ray tracing at the same frame rate.The story is surprisingly very good and interesting, voice actors do well in their assigned roles, and the opening of the game is similar to a blockbuster movie. The tale deals with wanting to be free, which Wukong wants, but the Celestial Court won't let him be. In addition, the court enjoys mocking him and other beast-like creatures, angering him as he rebels to prove his might. The difficulty is another aspect that might attract players looking to establish themselves and face off against challenging foes in exciting and nerve-wracking gameplay.The game's core combat focuses on options and the availability of resources. The player has multiple avenues for choosing how to fight enemies, such as spirits that they can summon and take their form to unleash special attacks, becoming bosses, using skills such as invisibility, or using their pole to get above the enemy and avoid attacks. Having so many assets to use on foes and see what works best against certain enemies is incredibly fun and rewarding.The premise is that the game is a boss rush; you go to a place, explore it, beat the boss, and move on. If you defeat bosses effortlessly, you run into a lot of bosses on the norm, and each combat is intriguing and unique. Battle monks that summon the fallen, rat siblings in a 1vs2, giant tigers that bathe in the blood of their foes with big swords, etc. The game action is fast, so you have to act quickly before enemies resume the onslaught of attacks. There is no co-op for this game (so those that like souls games with co-op experiences, be warned, it is only going to be you!), and there is no punishment for dying in-game, so you are stress-free and don't have to pick up your ""souls"" or currencies of other types.I enjoyed my time in the game, as brief as it was (I am getting old to be playing this hardcore game, I swear, haha~). I didn't find the stances attractive, as the default stance worked better for me than the other two. The tricks of Wukong are fun to use, and in boss fights, you need to use all of your arsenals intelligently to emerge victorious on the challenging boss fights, which is a great gameplay design. Enemies often have their particular bag of tricks they will use on the player.I used many points in the foundation, mainly HP and stamina. I also used some points in transformations and the immobility spell, as they are instrumental. The gameplay is like a combination of souls, like in action games. It is hard, but you are as powerful as your foes, making the soul-like experience less stressful and difficult. The game's presentation is fantastic; enemies react to your boss's transformations, and the dialogue in fights is on par with the rest of the game. A game playthrough will last between 40-60 hours, depending on your skill, and you can always replay the game after beating it to challenge even stronger foes. I am getting burned out of the genre. Go there, fight a powerful enemy, get destroyed, do it again until you succeed, and repeat for another 40 hours. I may have been playing too much Elden Ring, but I don't enjoy Souls games as much as I did before.Back to the review, if you like challenges meant to block your progression and prove your skills, this game is impressive. It excels at all its facets and is incredible to experience. If you prefer to avoid difficulty, be wary. It is a marathon to get to the end of this title, as the mountain is rather tall and complex to climb.It is an easy buy for its asking price. If your computer can run it, you are guaranteed to have a good time with this game.In a genre so cluttered with so many games that it feels oversaturated, Black Myth Wukong succeeds in adding a new spice to the genre by revolutionizing the gameplay and rewards of its core experience. It is a must-play for all souls, like fans who enjoy this title, and an invitation to try it out for those who feel braver and confident in their skills. This game's graphics, music, story, gameplay, and design are superb and worth all the praise it's been getting.10/10 MASTERPIECE:) If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator!

Positive,"The game has made its journey to the west.Destined Ones! Come hear my wisdom in my review of the wonderful game Black Myth Wukong!Black Myth Wukong is a legendary game by the Chinese studio Game Science. It is a game you should buy and experience at least once in your gaming career. You the player watch as the namesake Wukong gets up from his respite and fight Erlang, a boss sent to punish Wukong. Erlang uses a spell that causes a headache for Wukong, for whom he is defeated. As a result, the main character is another monkey who wields a staff so he can find the necessary items to resurrect Wukong from his frozen place, so he can be whole again. The story line establishes it self quite nicely. The Destined One label affixes itself to a monkey set out to find each of the 6 relics so that 6 senses can be employed to resurrect the legendary Sun Wukong. I have noticed a bunch of things that made my experience amazing. Environment and graphics are amazing. Clearly, much effort went into the creation of the environment that they look realistic and borderline uncanny valley in a good way; it is as if real like was digitized and made digital, with blades of grass looking amazing. Each environment draws me in the places that I spent a lot of time wanting to explore and relax there. I love it so so much and I spent so much time everywhere. It is like the gold standard of how to do things. A+. The wonders of Unreal Engine is exemplified through this game in the environments. I really liked how pretty the first level was with the shrines, grass, water and how well done it was. The original soundtrack proves its worth in a game such as this game, and worth a long listen. Most are instrumental in nature but well crafted for each moment. Each setting is well done and fully engrosses me into the moment so much so that I am not distracted. Piano, classical instruments, all so darn good. Chinese cultural instruments at work. The theme song Celestial Symphony, which is based on the theme song of the 1986 television series Journey to the West, which itself has been viewed by plenty of people in China, me included. I wanted to mention the character design are solidly well done. From characters such as the Sisters, to the individual secondary one that appear and to the random Yaoguai that appear, they are wonderfully done to the point where, it is amazing and not distracting. Tiger Vanguard is one. The Sisters are the best done in game. Two women worked in conjunction with one serving as the motion capture, and face model, and another as the voice. All are beautiful and Second Sister especially the looker.  The individual who brought Erlang to life is a great example of how well do to stuff. Looks polished and well done.Combat feels great, smooth, and addicting to engage. A variety of weapons avail themselves to the Destined One, and spells, and spirits. The Destined Ones can transform into various forms so that they can deal with enemies quite efficiently. One form can be used for one type of enemy and another for a separate type of enemy.The stances are the exemplary ones. There are quite a few versatile stuff that can be used. For example, I mostly used an aggressive combat heavy style that focused on damage dealing, which were efficient with assaulting yaoguai. Then there were defensive ones and agile ones that were useful for the Chiefs that were useful for bosses. I feel that if I didn’t use some of them, I would have died already. The combat system is the massive stand out aspect. Truly a masterpiece. I also liked the way that that shrines were used as a method of saving, resting, and a point of convenience. Every time I got it one, it was a nice marker on the map where it auto saved for me. Additionally, I can use a spell to teleport back to that point, so I can rest, prayer, and readjust stuff to continue on. It is also useful to get around the map to get through some of the objectives. This fast travel proves it self so convenient and I love it. A few things I noticed that could need massive improvement. First Minimap-A minimap needs to exist in game. When I’m playing, I want to know where on the map, and where to go. On some maps, it feels like a clue is needed to know where to go, but ends up going in circles or somewhere else unintended, and thus lost. Therefore, a minimap could make game life a bit easierSecond - Invisible WallsThe so-called “invisible walls”, that is, natural environment that are built so well that seem like it is part of the actual game boundaries of the world in-game, since it is built it is built so well that it blends in. A few times, I would walk somewhere, thinking it can be traversed, but cannot be done so. My argument goes back to the mention of a minimap earlier; the presence of one can help with the constant boundary crashes.Comments about the game in general. The game is based on Journey to the West, albeit an inspiration with the setting and characters based on it. I read the book years ago, and re-read it as a refresher recently. It was a great read with loads of fantasy. I read the book and found lots of good things in the game that were borrowed directly from the book. Like Erlang, the Celestial court, and the Tiger Vanguard. The spiders and supposed husband. Those characters are done well. I love it. Another interesting about the game are the music videos. After each chapter, there is a music video that plays at the end, and is accessible on the title screen. Each has some relation, if at all, to the plot of the chapter, and they tell a sentimental story of love, or change. Quite beautiful in telling. One thing that needs to change are English subtitles so that literally everyone can understand them, so it is not locked behind a particular language. Despite that, it is a neat thing to have in the game, and a bonus that really enhances the game so much. Black Myth Sequels. One thing that stuck out to me was the name. The Primary name Black Myth with subtitle “Wukong” feels like it could be room for more content under the name. It could be more stories with another monkey or stories that can be enriched afterwards, which I don’t doubt. I have some ideas but probably not come to fruition. Instead lets keep an eye out for it later on. Overall, it has come to my judgment on whether to recommend or not. In SummaryThis game is my personal game of the Year, no doubt. No other game released in 2024 comes close to this majesty of a game. It’s grandeur and splendor has captivated my attention for the better of 80+ hours, and it has sent me on a trip with my time.I recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a fantastic action game. I’m am glad that the game has made its Journey to the West."
Positive,"It's not a souls-game they say - me on my  30+ try on the 1st optional boss in the 1st area.while the game is punishing it never felt that it is unfair.World is Great, combat is solid and story is engaging. It is a game where the devs focused on the cores that what makes a good game."

Positive,"For a long time, whenever talking about China's game industry, it seems that countless players have sighed and lamented. Though its market value is tremendous and cannot be underestimated, the entire industry is almost supported by online and mobile games, and there are few achievements in AAA single-player games. In this context, August 20, 2024, would definitely be an unforgettable day for Chinese gamers. The future of Chinese single-player games, Black Myth: Wukong, has officially been released. On its first day, it has already reached a stunning 2.2 million players, and as of today, its total sales have reached 18 million copies, not only did it set a new first-week sales record among its genre, but also became the single-player game with the highest peak player count on steam. As the Chinese saying goes, 'A big tree attracts the wind'. While Black Myth: Wukong has won a large number of fans, it has also faced widespread questions and criticism. Can the quality of this game live up to such outstanding sales and an incredible number of players?Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a work whose merits outweigh its flaws. Though its strengths and weaknesses are clear, we cannot dismiss it completely because of this. Games featuring traditional Chinese landscapes, realistic cultural scenes such as Buddha statues and temples, and Chinese Taoist Mythology are rare nowadays. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, this game showcases a level of visual refinement and scene interactivity that is beyond the reach of most previous AAA titles, the realistic and delicate scene interaction brings players an immersive gaming experience, and the stunning art is enough to allow players to indulge in this gorgeous world where every screenshot feels like wallpaper. Huge game worlds, rich game content, and a wide variety of enemies are ahead for players to explore, the game and combat in each chapter are unique and thrilling, the amazing music adds an immersive atmosphere to it, too. The movie-quality cutscenes are of extremely high standards in terms of camera movement and performance effects. The ending animations of each chapter, which are in different styles, are well-made and profound in connotation. Though the plot narrative technique is rather obscure and difficult to grasp, the in-game journal fully supplements the worldview, characters, and background in the form of fables or stories. Reading thoroughly will allow you to unravel the plot's complex themes. Countless talents and a wide range of spells for players to freely choose from, thus evolving into numerous genres of gameplay. The game's transformation mechanism is a major feature, combined with the character's flexible body movements and gorgeous battle performance effects, Black Myth: Wukong remains consistently entertaining and engaging in each battle. The final boss and the final hidden boss battles have put a lot of effort into the design of the mechanism, the battle scene, and the artistic conception conveyed. The upgradable that can freely reset and no death penalty have all greatly optimized the player's gaming experience, most players will not find the game overly difficult to complete.Whether in good or bad ways, this game draws heavily on the design of many souls-like games. Even though the plot of Black Myth: Wukong is extremely profound, the overly fragmented storytelling hinders player comprehension. The plot based on the conclusion of the Journey to the West, is very familiar to Chinese players, however, the lack of clear cause-and-effect explanations will likely confuse many others. The journal also contains a vast amount of text, not all players may have the patience to finish it, let alone delve into the original Journey to the West. While the Chinese voice acting is excellent, the English voice acting feels a little lackluster, and misplaced and missing subtitles also show that Black Myth: Wukong still needs to improve in terms of localization. The developer may aim to encourage players to get rid of guides and explore on their own, but in a vast world with interconnected routes, extremely low scene recognition, and high similarity, without route guides and in-game maps, it is very easy to lose your sense of direction when actually playing. The frequent appearance of invisible walls since the third chapter makes it even more difficult for players to judge the true boundaries of the map. Player would find it hard to experience the complete game content without a guide. The numerous skills and transformations vary significantly in strength, the character's fragile ability to withstand attacks also makes the game have relatively high requirements on the player's reaction ability and operational tolerance. The optimization of Black Myth: Wukong is extremely poor, with problems such as long loading time, frame drops, and crashes often occurring. In terms of the lighting transition between light and dark scenes, and the lighting effects in dark scenes, Black Myth: Wukong also performs extremely poorly. The design of the large bosses in the game, such as Captain wise-voice and The duskveil is problematic, the battle experience is frustrating. The design of the probability of dropping some collectibles is even worse, and compared to the earliest gameplay trailer, the officially released version has cut too much content. Even in the existing chapters, many story elements feel abrupt and lack depth, leaving too many gaps. Although the fifth and sixth chapters are also quite good, they are inferior to the previous chapters, and signs of development rush are extremely obvious. In a market lacking AAA titles, Game Science has made unremitting efforts and delivered Black Myth: Wukong in 4 years, which is no small feat. Whether through its unique, realistic, and excellent art, or its satisfying and exhilarating comfort, it will definitely make you indulge in it. If you take the time and savor it quietly, you will definitely be shocked and leave endless aftertaste. It should be noted that no matter how good a game is, it will eventually have its audience, and this is especially true for Black Myth: Wukong as an action role-playing game. As the saying goes, 'seeing is believing.' if you can accept the shortcomings mentioned above, you still need to experience it for yourself to understand its mystery. In the end, Black Myth: Wukong still benefits the vast majority of players on three major levels: in terms of game aesthetics, its success stands in stark contrast to the dismal ending of Concord, which implements political correctness and diversified aesthetics, and will inevitably sound the alarm for the art design of future games; in terms of the game engine, Black Myth: Wukong further demonstrates the massive potential of the Unreal 5 engine, more developers will likely turn to it for game development, which will surely bring games with more stunning visual effects and improved optimization in the future; in the Chinese game industry, the huge success of Black Myth: Wukong has overturned the previous monopoly of online games and mobile games in the market. The potential of single-player games will inevitably drive more Chinese developers to invest in it. Even if you discover that this game isn't to your liking, its popularity will surely bear fruit in the future and will be beneficial to the entire gaming industry. I would like to express my special thanks to my friend WH.Z  for gifting me this excellent work. I shall like to dedicate this review to him."
Positive,REJECT MODERNITYRETURN TO MONKE
Positive,"I recently bought a new computer specifically for playing this game, and I can confidently say it was worth every penny. The graphics are breathtaking, with vivid and lifelike detail that makes everything feel real. The gameplay is so immersive that it pulls you into another world, and every aspect of the game has been carefully and precisely crafted. The story is captivating, filled with rich narratives and complex characters that grow and evolve as you play, keeping you engaged from beginning to end. From the ambient sound design to the intricate level layouts, everything is fantastic, making the whole experience not just enjoyable, but unforgettable.雄壯山河, 秀麗風光."
Positive,"As I face the reality of my terminal illness diagnosis, This game has become a rare light in my life. Growing up I found comfort in the unforgiving challenge and beauty of soulslike games, and now, in what may be my final months, this game has given me a chance to reconnect with that comfort one last time.The developers have created a visually stunning and mechanically precise action RPG that offers both the challenge and the sense of achievement that we crave. The intricate combat, alongside the visually striking environments, makes every moment memorable. It’s given me something to look forward to, allowing me to lose myself in its rich world when I need it most.If you're a fan of soulslike games and appreciate the art of a well crafted challenge, I can't recommend Black Myth: Wukong enough. To me, it's not just a game: it's a gift, providing a final sense of purpose and achievement. My deepest gratitude goes to the developers for creating this masterclass."
Positive,"This game in my opinion should be game of the year. Healing can be a bit unresponsive as it does not delay the input if you get knocked down and try to take a quick swig while getting back up but once you get past that it's a really amazing game. Great story and a world inspired by Chinese mythology and The Journey to the West. I really liked the perfect dodge system and the ability to change my build at any resting point to really let me try everything out. I fought every boss, meditated in every location, and met all the characters for the journal and I enjoyed the entire experience. Baije was amazing and really added a lot to the Destined One's journey; I think his last few lines of dialogue in the game was my favorite part. It is not as challenging as FROM software titles but to me it played a lot like Elden Ring with its own unique style and I had a lot of fun with it. I am looking forward to any DLC news for this game in the future. A rare 10/10 experience."
Positive,"At first, I thought this game was gonna be another Souls-like, but after playing and getting my first death, I didn’t lose any XP or anything—it all stayed with me. Feels more like a Chinese version of God of War (because of the mythology) mixed with Devil May Cry, with all the skills and stuff. Yeah, this game’s got that PlayStation vibe. After waiting 4 years for this, I gotta say, I’m not disappointed. But, the optimization could’ve been better, especially with the cinematic graphics setting. Other than that, it’s solid—I didn’t get any stutters or crashes, and the game runs super smooth on very high settings."
Positive,"If I were to rate this game, I would give it a 9. The graphics deserve a 10, but there is still a bit of room for improvement in terms of game balance. As a bilingual speaker fluent in both Chinese and English, I have been familiar with the story of ""Journey to the West"" since childhood, and this game has fulfilled a childhood dream of mine. I hope that more top-tier game IPs like this one will emerge. Many countries around the world have rich mythologies, from Sparta to Egypt, from Japan's Amaterasu to Greek myths, or even the myths of the Sumerian civilization, as well as other Chinese mythological stories like ""The Classic of Mountains and Seas."" I hope that one day, these can all be transformed into top-tier games, allowing me to experience them through VR."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong was a game I’d been eagerly waiting for since it was first revealed in 2020. Like many others, I was skeptical about whether the developers could deliver on such an ambitious project. I don’t think the Steam reviews and player counts accurately reflect the reality. The overwhelmingly positive reviews and high player counts are largely driven by nationalistic support from China, where the game is celebrated as a major achievement. While my review is positive because I do believe the game is good, I also think it is kind of overrated. As always, I aim to provide honest opinions and a truthful assessment of my experience. I am writing this review after actually completing this game, unlike every review with 2 hours and claiming it GOTY.Graphics and OptimizationThe game’s graphics are outstanding. The visual fidelity, from the breathtaking environments to the intricate character designs, is top-notch. The animations, visual effects, and render distance are all impressive, adding to the game’s overall looks. The sound effects are equally well done, though the soundtrack leaves much to be desired. While the game runs smoothly for the most part, Chapter 3, particularly the snowy maps, does suffer from performance issues. Despite this, the overall optimization is solid, and the game manages to maintain its high graphical standards without too many hiccups.Bosses and CombatThe bosses in Black Myth: Wukong are a real feat to play against. When it was revealed that the game had 81 bosses, I was sure that at least half of them would be replicated, similar to what we saw in Elden Ring. But it's shocking and great to say that more than 90% of the bosses in the game are unique, each one fun to play and mostly well-designed. However, most of the bosses are surprisingly easy. Speaking of difficulty, I’ve seen some people argue that Wukong isn’t a Soulslike, but I would definitely consider it one. It has everything a Souls game offers, except for the corpse-run mechanic. It has some similarities to God of War and Bayonetta, but I believe it’s much closer to Soulsborne titles than that.Game Feel and Combat MechanicsThe game feels and combat is initially great and fun to play. The fluidity of movement and the responsiveness of controls are great. However, as I played through the game, I found that it became too repetitive for me, even with the large variety of bosses and enemy types. Once you discover which combos and moves work best, there’s little need to change them. The same goes for the Spirit mechanics. The game provides you with a ton of spirits, but once you find a good one and upgrade it, there’s really no need to use others, just like how most people only played with the Mimic Tear in Elden Ring. The spells, while fun to use, also feel limited in variety. Only having four spells for a 40-hour game made the experience feel stale over time. Additionally, the spells cost mana, which restricts their usage, especially during boss fights. Since the most fun aspect of Wukong is using these spells, this limitation is quite a shame.The big skill trees in the game primarily change your passive stats and your heavy attack, which you use rarely. This adds to the repetitiveness of the combat since the skill trees don’t significantly alter how you engage in battles, making the combat feel even more repetitive as you progress.Story and CharactersWhen it comes to the story, Black Myth: Wukong seemingly tells the story of Journey to the West. I have no prior knowledge of this story or the movie, so I didn’t get much out of it. The mute protagonist doesn’t help either. The game seems to expect players to be familiar with the original story, which made it hard for me to connect with the narrative.Level and Map DesignThe level and map design is by far the worst part of Black Myth: Wukong and the major thing that severely impacted my experience, reducing the enjoyment I got from the game by miles. In Chapter 1, the level design is very linear—you kill a few enemies, 30 seconds later comes an amazing boss fight, you kill another bunch, and a minute later, another spectacular boss fight. This pattern repeats until the end of the chapter. At first, I wasn't sure if I liked this; it felt odd and almost made the game seem like a boss rush experience. But since I was enjoying the heck out of the bosses, I loved this design choice, and fighting new bosses every 10 minutes was such a joy. This continued the same way until I reached the Tiger Vanguard boss fight, which is the peak of Black Myth Wukong in terms of game design tempo. The boss was one of the best in the game. At that point, I was sure I was playing the Game of the Year 2024 and possibly one of the best action games I've ever played.Unfortunately, that's when the game began going downhill. By Chapter 3, the game started to feel very repetitive, with the same combat mechanics being reused over and over. In Chapters 2 and 3, you start playing in huge, open world-ish maps. Now, is that a bad thing? Elden Ring did the same, right? No, because Wukong's maps are filled with limiting invisible walls everywhere. There are hundreds of the same enemies throughout the map, and you often go in a direction unsure if it's worth your time. You never know if you’ll find a new boss, an invisible wall, a little XP, or just nothing at all. I found myself sprinting around the huge maps only to find nothing most of the time, as there was no indicator if the journey was worth it. What adds to the frustration is that the game doesn’t guide you to your main objective, or even clearly define what it is. So, if you’re bored of aimlessly wandering around, you can't simply rush to the main quest. This lack of direction makes the game feel even more disjointed and tiresome. The issue peaks in Chapter 6, where the game becomes a frustrating slog. There’s never an indoor-level design to alleviate this, except for one extremely linear and frustrating dungeon. The lack of a map or compass is a particularly bad decision, especially since even FromSoftware addressed this with Elden Ring. The graphical quality of the maps is insane, but they look extremely bland and uninspiring compared to the art design of Elden Ring. This detracts from the game’s atmosphere and overall enjoyment.Music and SoundtrackThe music and soundtrack are also quite poor, which significantly affects the atmosphere of the world. The only song I liked was the one sung by the headless dude; nothing else stood out. No Soulsborne or Soulslike game has ever come close to the level of Dark Souls 3's soundtrack, and Wukong doesn’t change that.Bugs and GlitchesMany bosses and enemies have a tendency to freeze during fights, some even becoming invincible. These bugs made me replay the same enemies several times.ConclusionIn conclusion, Black Myth: Wukong is a good game, even though it’s far from meeting all of my expectations. Despite its shortcomings, it is a very solid entry from Game Science. I will be highly looking forward to their next game as much as I did for Black Myth: Wukong, hoping they will improve upon these shortcomings and deliver an even more polished experience. I don’t have a definitive Game of the Year candidate for this year, but I can confidently say that Black Myth: Wukong isn't it. For me, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown stands out as a better title.Follow My Curator Page ❤️"
Positive,"""Whole presentation - gorgeous. The gameplay - sound! All I ever wanted is a fun game free from modern nonsense and their so-called live services. Those high above don't like this. I understand that. And they send IGN and those knuckleheads to threaten it and obey. I understand that too. But what I don't understand is... where are they now?""A perfect blend of genres and ideas creates an unforgettable experience. And even with some technical and narrative hiccups (mostly chapter 6) this is an exhilarating journey from start to finish and should not be missed."

I couldn't be happier.About the game : Inshort the game is cinema. The developers put soul into this game which many games now days lack, the soundtracks, visual setting, bosses everything is so good so far.It surely has some performance issues like it crashes sometimes but it is very rare and happens with other games too, sometimes the textures do not load properly that could be fixed with some fixes I think. Overall this game is once in a decade experience!Do not rush it and enjoy it at your own pace. :D"
Positive,"Amazing game in every aspect. Totally recommended it if you're into something similar to God of War (the new one) with some soulslike mechanics. Very fun to play, linear and semi-open world regions with lots of exploration, secrets, enemies and some remarkable bosses.As far as performance goes, if you don't use Ray Tracing on Very High (or don't use it at all) and turn on upscaling, you'll be fine. Ray Tracing is quite demanding in some areas later in the game. Even with Frame Generation, it may not be enough depending on your GPU. Also, yes, New Game+ unlocks after you finish the game. You get to keep everything you earned, except the items required to progress the story. Enemies also become stronger.Specs:Ryzen 5 7600RTX 40702x16GB 5200MHz DDR5SSD Nvme Gen4Win 11Played most of the game at 1440p, 60 fps, Cinematic Settings, DLSS Balanced, FG ON, Ray Tracing Very High.During the last chapter I had to tune down Ray Tracing a bit to maintain an average of 60 fps. I had one crash. No blue screen or out of memory errors."

Positive,"Steam Deck Playability ( 7/10)GOTF ? (100/10) !!DLSS MOD USESteam Deck LCD ReviewSo, after extensive research on trying to play this game without too much an issue. Playing it with so called DLSS MOD is VERY RECOMMENDED. Seeing many people saying about how this will struggle in Chapter 2 on forth especially on tiger vanguard and other bosses. I would say, this game can run perfectly by using the mod I mention above. Chapter 1 PreviewStarting from the prologue, i have a bit of problem with the graphics but that all changed after the Prologue. Graphics from Steam Deck is as people know is ALL Set to LOW. However, i set Texture to HIGH because i still can run it great without impacting the performance by a lot. Take in mind, i am using the DLSS MOD. Therefore the Frame Generation is on. In my Steam Settings also i enable Allow Tearing, and Manual GPU Clock set to 1600 MHz with Scaling Filter FSR set to 3 Sharpness. I experiment a lot with this and doing as above, i actually got very good looking graphics with acceptable performance, getting almost 60 fps stable except sometime it might drop to 55-59 or lower depend on the location. However my play in Chapter 1 is almost perfect and i like it very much.Starting from Chapter 2 Above, I set Texture back to low, because there is pixelated environment and stuttering keep happening. However, i manage to run it stable in 60 fps so it worth the sacrifice. There is still stuttering sometime but i guess this is because loading the environment and so on. My fight with all the bosses does not affect anything much. No lagging input like people mention which is weird. Probably just me, but i am glad everything went smooth .To put it simply, running DLSS MOD imo is just important if you want to try play in Steam Deck. Take note i also run CryoUtilities and also Wukong with Latest Proton GE-11. This is also been done in Steam Deck LCD. So i dont see how OLED cant run better than this unless you do something wrong. I hope there is optimization been done to make it much better and no need of DLSS MOD. My Steam Deck Settings: Frame Limit 60 FPSAllow TearingManual GPU Clock 1600MHzScaling Filter FSR ( Sharpness 3)Game Resolution ( Set in Properties ) = 1280x720 If you use DLSS MOD , Perhaps using lower can improve the performance ( Need testing) []IN-Game SettingsPrefer All Low, OFF everything OFF like V-Sync and Motion Blur for Smooth gameplay. Can make Exception for Texture to set to HIGH depend if you can run it much better or want to sacrfice some performance. Prefer to set to low in Chapter 2 above because just how big the environment is. From my gameplay and research , WUKONG IS ONE OF A MUST HAVE for HandHeld Console . Of course there is many room for improvement which i hope the dev consider to do so for Steam Deck. I have not being sleeping playing this game for a day and looking for the best way to experience on Steam Deck. For those who have problem with this game being unplayable, try to get the DLSS MOD like i mention and try to do more research just like what i did. You wont regret it !!"

Positive,"9/10 for this gameEpic level game, a rare Eastern legendary story. The entire game is exquisitely crafted, with excellent performance effects and top-notch music and sound effects. This game is a milestone. Of course, for friends from non-Asian cultural circles who want to understand the story of this game, they must be familiar with relevant literary works (Journey to the West). The localization of this game is also a challenge. As Chinese people, we are easy in understanding the dialogue and lines in the game, because the story of Journey to the West is well known to women and children, but for English players, some lines with a large number of religious, mythological and ancient Chinese (classical Chinese) elements will bring no small understanding challenges.史诗级游戏，一个罕见的东方传奇故事。整个游戏制作精良，具有出色的表演效果和一流的音乐和音效。这款游戏是一个里程碑。当然，对于非亚洲文化圈的朋友来说，想要了解这款游戏的故事，必须熟悉相关的文学作品（《西游记》）。这个游戏的翻译也是一个挑战。作为中国人，我们不难理解游戏中的对话和台词，因为《西游记》的故事对妇女和儿童来说是众所周知的，但对于英国玩家来说，一些带有大量宗教、神话和中国古代（文言文）元素的台词将带来不小的理解挑战。Let's talk about some flaws in the current game:1) There is no scene map, and for players who are not accustomed to exploring and wandering maps, finding their way may pose some challenges.2) The game does not have difficulty adjustment options, and some bosses are very challenging.3) The skills of the BOSS unit are not clearly indicated, making evasion difficult.4) There is no way to pause during cutscenes, or it is difficult for non Chinese users to read lines (subtitles are too small), and there is no way to view ""historical dialogue records"".让我们来谈谈当前游戏中的一些缺陷：1） 没有场景地图，对于不习惯探索和漫游地图的玩家来说，找到自己的路可能会带来一些挑战。2） 游戏没有难度调整选项，有些BOSS非常具有挑战性。3） BOSS的技能没有明确指出，这使得闪避变得困难。4） 过场动画中没有停顿的方法，或者非中文用户很难阅读台词（字幕太小），也无法查看“历史对话记录”。"

Positive,"Love it, love it, love it! The storytelling, animation, scenery, and music are all insanely good. I can’t wait to see what incredible story comes next—maybe one featuring gods like Erlang Shen or Nezha. Arghh! There are so many amazing stories to tell the world, and I’m excited to see where they take us next!Here’s a tip for those struggling with the combat: take it easy, be patient, and learn the boss’s patterns. Start by focusing on dodging until you feel confident, then gradually begin attacking the boss. After that, it’ll be easy peasy lemon squeezy!"
Positive,"Very good game. Runs well. I like the boss fights, there's a lot of them. I would like to say more about the game's narrative in which so little people are discussing.The story is a very good twist to the Wukong narrative which has the protagonist journey through different places to gather the 6 relics of The Great Sage (Sun Wukong) to bring him back from the dead. Each Chapter feels like a philosophical Buddhist dialogue about characters that have failed to follow in the steps of Buddha due to their earthly nature. There are beautiful movie shorts that play at the end of each chapter that adds a layer of narrative to the characters and the places you visit. Best way to describe it is like if Elden Ring showed you a movie before everything went to shit. Theres also a mural with an old wise man narrator making philosophical commentary on the tragic characters that you meet (and fight) during your journey which is a really nice touch. There is some humour to be found that these characters are in stark contrast to Wukong's effortless attainment of Buddhahood in which he later regretted due to having missed the simple joys of life. This fuels the thematic conflict that is pervasive in this game; Man's desire to transcend the Earth and escape the tragedy of this world, as opposed to giving in to Earthly desires and all the things, both good and bad, attached to it. This is a very tonally consistent game with a very subtle, introspective emotional delivery (similar to Elden Ring). Music is used at a minimum here, with it only really playing during boss fights. Despite music not being used often, it is effective when it is (especially in Chapter 2). It is so unlike western games that are more overt with its delivery of narrative mood. Games like God of War 2016 uses music more heavily and changes mood according to the scene being showed. It also easy to tell when scenes in God of War are trying to be humorous due to me knowing the language. In Wukong, it is very hard to tell the humour apart due to me not knowing Chinese language and culture. I can tell people will have a different experience of this game whether if you're from China or not but this is just how the game made me feel.I played the game in English VA to really get the emotional aspect that the narrative is trying to deliver. Whether it is true to the Chinese vibe, i do not know. All in all, it is a very fun game. 9/10"
Positive,"So far I'm crashing during the tutorial.  I've verified integrity of the files, and now I'm going to try uninstalling and reinstalling. From the looks of things many other players have also had crashing issues. Hopefully it's fixed soon. On the bright side, from what I did get the chance to play, its fun! Its also one of the more graphically impressive games out there. Depending on when the crashes are fixed I'll change my review.-- Edit: I have updated my drivers, uninstalled, and reinstalled.

Positive,"I've been waiting for this game to release since the first announcement with very low expectations. I gotta say,  it took me by surprise to see there were no downgrades (*coughs* ubisoft) and so far the game is amazing. 10/10 i would recommend. It's a mix between Souls-like games and Norse Saga God of War games and i love it."
Positive,"Review After 100% AchievementsReally enjoyed my journey through this title! Combat feels really great with the stance swapping mechanics. If you like boss fights, this is the game for you, with there being like 90+ for you to conquer. Some more challenging than others, but all are unique and memorable for you to tackle again on your next playthrough in NG+. Everything in this game works well together; the spirts, spells, vessels…all of them made for some really cool variety in gameplay. The ability to change your build on the fly is a huge plus and I loved the chapter-to-chapter format of the story. Animated cutscene story tales were an awesome touch to bring each chapter to a close. Most of all, I loved finding all the hidden areas and questlines along the way, figuring out secret items and bosses that you might not run into without exploring. All of the achievements were fun to go after, collecting all items and defeating every enemy to complete your journal is an awesome feeling to accomplish. This game deserves all the positive feedback it’s receiving and I hope to see DLC/a sequel in the future! Achievement Count: 81Time to 100%: ~70hrsDifficulty: ★★★✩✩Genre of Game: Action RPG, Mythology, CombatFun Rating: 9/10Checkout my YT video review or my  Steam Curator Page!"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong has truly set a new standard for action/RPG games,  the game is a stunning world that brilliantly blends mythological elements of the Monkey King,  (a trickster god) <- Journey to the West novel.Graphics: The visuals are incredibly striking, from landscapes, world & character design, fluid animations, and lush environments all is crafted with care and detail.  It's a treat for the eyes.Game-play and Mechanics: Movement and combat is very fluid and has a sharp feel of control,  a well set balance between challenge and victory aka the reward.  With the combination of spells , magic and another thing that i just cannot mention here cause of spoilers (not even a hint - sorry).  Game-play is fantastic, encounters are fresh and exciting ,  i just love the huge amount of Bosses in this game, and many are hidden , some have quests u can do with a variety of rewards such as upgrade material or a extra Vendor.Story and Characters: The narrative draws from the classic Chinese epic ""Journey to the West,"" , by showcasing elements of Chinese mythology and folklore, the game not only entertains but also educates about a rich cultural heritage.  What stood out for me was that the story is driven by conflicts that involve not only physical battles but also moral and philosophical dilemmas.  Again a lot of attention to detail.Conclusion: Black Myth: Wukong is a awesome game. I can't wait to see what the developers have in store for future updates (DLC?), as this game has set the bar higher for others in the genre."
Positive,"- Started the game- See monke with armour looking at the horizon- Monke jumps- Rides a freaking cloud just like Goku - Stops in front of an army - Me afraid, monke not afraid- God gay dude says monke is an idiot- Monke laughs- Monke starts to beat the shit out of the gay god- Gay god flees from the fight- Monke mountain getting destroyed- Me sad, monke angry- We bring them to the forest- We now bird, bird flies- Gay god now bird too- Something happens and monke loses his power of bird- Oh no- Monke defeated- Many years later, we gather with other apes and listen to the history of master monke- We learn that the true monke is the friends we make along the way- I drop the controllerAbsolute Cinema"
Positive,"I’m happy to say that this game was worth the wait. Everything from the amazing set pieces, combat, characters, and attention to detail were just breathtaking to me. It’s so clear that there was a ton of love poured into this game, so many little nods and extra effort put into even the little things that you cant help but be charmed by it all.It’s very polished, only occurred a couple minor bugs throughout my playthroughs, and once you figure out how the game works and the map progression plays out, it’s very rewarding and plays through smoothly. I will say though, the idea of stances is fun - but I never found much of a reason to swap from the default smash stance and just crank out the big damage.I don’t really have too many complaints besides the combat being a little spammy, but that kind of works because it lets you focus instead on learning to react to the bosses, rather than managing a ton of complex mechanics on your end.I 100% the game because I enjoyed the game so much. (Also bought the 8bitdo black myth: wukong edition controller, it's my new go to now.) Definitely would recommend, and I believe it deserves the hype. Can't wait to see what else comes in the future :)"
Positive,"Did not expect the game to be this good, very polished combat, variety builds(you have free infinite respec to change your combat style anytime you want), bosses are really unique as well. Surprisingly lots of hidden secrets and side quests, best part is you can backtrack and do all the side quest even after completing the chapter.9/10 would be nice if we have more exploration instead of linear progression path but this is just personal preferences. Also Chapter 4 is peak.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update after 100hours of playtime: I've completed pretty much everything the game can offer, except maxing out all Spirits and Equipments (you need about NG+5 to get enough Knot of Voidness for all Spirits upgrade). I like how the game gives you a secret stance but require a lot of work for it, too bad it can't last long (That's what she said).You definitely don't need to do new playthrough but highly recommend trying out NG+1 as you get some new stuff to play with. The scaling for NG+3 onwards is a bit 'unbalanced' as you pretty much hit the cap of scaling of your damage/defence but enemies/bosses just scale harder than you, which can makes it a bit unfun.Still a great game, prob GOTY 2024 for me."
Positive,"I'm sure the Western gaming press didn't give ‘Black Myth: Wukong’ the rating it deserved.It's not because I'm a Chinese gamer that I blindly praise my country for creating a work of art.From the IGN review: ‘The story assumes you have knowledge of Journey to the West and is tough to follow without it’. I think localised translations do present some problems, as many complex cultural backgrounds take a long time to research in order to make the most accurate translation.But for all the overseas players, please trust me that a lot of the game's backstory is hard to understand even for me, such as some of the words carved on the stone monuments.In addition, there is also something that game science, a game maker, likes to hide content, and many parts of the game content are scattered throughout the game, requiring players to constantly explore and dig into the details.For a Chinese gamer like me, I finally don't have to go to the language settings to find the language option and change it to Simplified Chinese. Now I just need to keep the default settings.I hope this game can become a huge success and everyong can enjoy the game content while he is exploring the mysterious world of Journey to the West.If you encounter some obscure content while playing, you can leave a comment. I will go to the Chinese search engine to see if I can find the answer (I am not sure I can solve your problem), but everyone can express their own opinions. I believe this is the joy of playing games together and understanding them."

Positive,"“To craft a masterpiece, one must avoid the counsel of SweetBaby Inc.”- Sun Tzu, probably"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a game I've eagerly anticipated for what feels like an eternity, and it doesn't disappoint. This title perfectly captures the essence of a classic hack and slash experience, evoking memories of the golden PS3 era. The gameplay is smooth, satisfying, and relentless, offering the kind of visceral combat that fans of the genre will instantly fall in love with.What makes Black Myth: Wukong stand out even more is its scale. The game doesn't just pit you against a handful of enemies; it throws you into epic, sprawling battles that feel monumental. The sense of grandeur in each fight, the vast environments, and the formidable foes all contribute to a game that feels as massive as the legend it’s based on.Speaking of legends, the story is rooted in the already incredible tale of the Monkey King, one of the most beloved characters in Chinese folklore. The narrative pulls you in, blending myth with a dark, fantastical world that is both enchanting and terrifying. Black Myth: Wukong doesn't just tell the story; it makes you live it, putting you in the shoes or rather, the fur of one of the most iconic characters in mythology.However, it's frustrating to see the double standards in the industry when it comes to discussing diversity and inclusion in video games. Screen Rant, for example, has been criticized for targeting only Asian games with accusations of lacking diversity titles like Stellar Blade, Genshin Impact, and now Black Myth: Wukong.And honestly, what kind of diversity are people expecting from a game about a stone monkey fighting demons? There are literally no humans in sight, not even Chinese characters, because the story is rooted in myth, not in modern social narratives. Yet somehow, some still find things to complain about, pushing Western agendas into places they simply don't belong.Edit: Wow the game reached 2.2 Million player, becoming one of the most played single player game ever. This is the result of making game for the sake of making game, instead of making a game for political agenda."
Positive,"They did a commendable job on their first trypros:1. breath-taking aesthetics2. great variety of bosses3. many details(hidden boss etc.) that can show dev's love and dedication4. somewhat new interpretation of the orginal story of ""journey to the west""cons:1. performance suffers a bit stutter even with 4090.2. high res but could get blurry during camera transition and also during movement. it feels current-gen but sometime also prev-gen.3. lighting is less optimized. caves could get really dark that i can see nothing, and some area are super bright. it feels unnatural. 4. no way near Capcom's level of polishness in terms of action feedback5. too many invisible walls is very annoying 6. slow loading screen even on a super fast SSD7. lack variety in regular enemies 8. camera control is not ideal especially on large boss9. level design update:constant stutter from chapter 3 all the way to the end. Really negatively impact the entire experience. It's a decent game, but it's faaaaaaaaaaaaaar from perfect."
Positive,"First of all,I'd like to say this is a good game.Although there are some gameplay issues (FPS,Bugs,map design balabalabala) which sometimes bring me bad experiences,It's sense of hit, plot and effects are all qualified or even excellent.This game is not as perfect as the crazy fans thought (TGA game of the year！Beyond Elden Rings!).Don't over-glorify it for some political or personal reasons.Pointing out the problems to the developer to solve it and it will make the game environment better.So plz don't make the community as terrifying as the Genshin Impact.As a new beginning of the Chinese game,it's enough,and it worths the praises.The future is bright and hopeful."
Positive,After Elden Ring dlc this is now my jam! Really enjoyed so far absolute worth for buying full price!!!this game run perfectly 30 fps on steam deck btw so great optimised game
Positive,Return to monke
Positive,Fuck you IGN
Positive,"I refunded it, but not because of errors or optimization, I give it a try, it feels like a GoW but with much more mobility, and some cool tricks.I don't know why I was expecting more like a Darksouls, but that's my bad, game is good."
Positive,"+Fantastic set pieces, some boss fights are simply sublime hitting all the right notes for a truly memorable epic encounter.+Amazing art direction with very unique world / characters.+Absolute Cinema, Wukong probably delivers the best showpieces ever featured in a video game.+Top notch visuals and presentation.+Memorable and high quality soundtrack.+Very well paced considering the game is massive, packed with content, there's plenty of secrets and it never fails to surprise as each chapter advances. It feels very satisfying to progress as you play.+Amazing intros and outros for each chapter, you'll see for yourself.-Environments may be pretty but there's too much empty spaces with obtuse level design resulting in poorly rewarded exploration, there's a lot of empty spaces that serves no purpose besides making an area looking bigger. Also, some frustrating placement of invisible walls, which is kinda funny bc it looks like they didn't know where to close some areas using the environment (using walls, rocks, trees, etc) leading to some badly placed invisibile walls but they also went nuts with widening ground space in a game with slow traversal, stamina consumption while running and mostly populated with uninteresting loot. I feel like the game simply shines brighter when it's focused with tightly designed levels, for example chapter 2's wasteland felt like a slog and in chapter 3 you'll get bored to death with the snow section and the frozen enemies. Chapter 1 and 4 felt so much better to play. -Skill tree unlockables are underwhelming. Skill variety is great but the upgrades are kinda boring.-Story will probably hit you as nonsensical if you know nothing about Journey to the West.-Game kinda fails to properly communicate some system mechanics stuff to the player in the long run.-Visual clues in combat is very lacking at times, sometimes it looks like the enemy was just moving a limb or itself around with its animation but actually it was an poorly visually communicated attack and you'll get hit by it. I also feel like sometimes the aim for a ""realistic accurate"" illumination can lead to bad visual clarity in combat, that happens a lot while exploring some places outside of boss fights.-The camera can be very clunky while fighting in tight spaces or not helpful at all while taking on multiple enemies engaging at once.-Just a personal opinion but I think being able to more openly cancel attacks would do wonders to open up the combat fun factor (specially the base light combo that you'll be using all the time throughout the whole game). The light attack flurry gets old pretty fast and you'll be using it a lot. Unlocking the spear mid game felt like a bit of fresh air just by the sole fact that it changes the basic light attacks animation.It takes inspiration from Souls titles but leans a lot more into ""character action games"" when it comes to combat, that may turn off some closed-minded people who expected this to be the next closest thing to a From Software game made by another studio. Actually Wukong is a thing of its own, not really a Soulslike, it feels more like a character action game with RPG elements,  what I mean by that is you'll steal your turns in combat with multiple tools available instead of waiting, feels more like a grounded Bayonetta / Devil May Cry / God of War instead of a Dark Souls approach to the method. Plus, you lose nothing upon dying. On the other hand exploration and traversal feels pretty much like a Souls title but lacking the finesse that you'll find in From Software games, at least most of the time.Game is great overall, but it feels kinda unpolished at times with its systems / combat and very lacking in level design, but yeah it looks pretty af with grandiose set pieces and a respectfully creative art direction with some truly amazing boss fights. Still, very impressive for a studio first output, its leagues above what most western developers are trying to do in the  AAA gaming space.It's refreshing to see a triple A single player title thriving so well in a sea of disconnected live service games flopping hard while trying to be the next Fortnite / Overwatch 1 or whatever, especially coming from a brand new studio, despite some flaws this is the good stuff, highly recommended."

Positive,"After 20 hours, I am still in Chapter 3 discovering secrets and paths. This game is amazing as hell, the only thing I kinda miss is some sort of map, since you can get lost in some areas really easily, but it's fine.Amazing graphics, amazing combat with different styles to play around, free skillpoint refunds if you wanna change your build, interesting story and sidequests. So far the best release of the year and easy GOTY contender imo."
Positive,"What a journey it has been ... From starting on the top of Mount Huaguo, till the return home, It's been an amazing experience. Being a Non-Souls-Like player, it was a bit difficult at first with bosses and learning the mechanics, especially Perfect Dodges. The story kept me connected throughout the journey. The characters were so, so good. And Zhu Bajie, if anything happens to him, I would kill everyone in this Earth and then myself. Almost all the boss fights were memorable and fascinating, some even unique.Finally Erlang. The Old Friend. That was an epic fight (fights, as he kicked my ass multiple times) and the following fights with the 4 Heavenly Kings and Erlang Shen. That fight was legendary, Breathtaking, Epic and so on... Then finally, again had the confrontation with Stone Monkey and The Great Sage's Shell and defeated them again... and had My Final Fulfillment.This game has made a mark on my mind and heart, and will forever be The Best Game, I have ever played. The mechanics, game-play, story and especially the music, everything tops each other. A journey, everyone must experience, at least once.A Real Masterpiece !Finally, I am on my way to start a New Cycle ... The Revenge Run !!"
Positive,"Ever experience one of those moments in life when you're thankful to have lived long enough to witness an event? Honestly, I am blown away by the quality of Black Myth Wukong, and after completing chapter 1 in full, I can wholeheartedly say it is one of the most polished games in recent years to carry on the torch toward another golden age of gaming; an era in which we can say NO to delusional propaganda led by the woke crowd and truly immerse ourselves in masterful storytelling and peak gameplay.Enriched StorytellingA unique take on an existing mythological tale. Great storytelling in post-2020 media is a rare breed and Black Myth Wukong brings back a practice that many have forgotten in the past decade: the ancient art of ""show, don't tell."" As a result, a player with more than half a brain cell becomes intrigued, piqued with curiosity as to where the journey will take us next. That very simple step that produces the foundation of a great game, in and of itself, is something many fail to do in this generation. Hence, a praiseworthy achievement.A Realm To Visit More Than OnceFrom the first cutscene to being dropped into the world as an unknown adventure taking on the mantle of the hero Wukong, the environment takes your breath away. There is an ever-so-subtle ambience that is neither noisy nor silent, overwhelming nor underwhelming... neither raging nor soothing to the senses. It is the perfect balance of making you feel like you want to stay there forever yet progress to see what comes next. The mob enemies you come across are not as threatening as you may think, but provide a challenge once you approach. Bosses have a variety of moves and behaviors that allows you to enjoy the interaction throughout the grueling battles, and they're not mindbogglingly difficult enough to make you throw your controller out the window. The level of detail and quality placed into each animation of both the character and enemies, down to the simple action of opening a chest to find new gear/items shows the amount of love and passion that went into this project.Depth & ProgressionAs with storytelling, the character progression in the game is less so about ""wanting to become stronger"", but rather a sense of wanting to see what comes next in your journey. The other myriad of games I've played over the past few years have molded me into an elitist player, one who always min/maxes when he can to reach the endgame as quickly as possible before anyone else to play god. Every now and then, however, I come across a game that I go into with a different mindset; a mindset that allows me to slow down, take a breath, and enjoy the journey rather than seek the end result in a heartbeat. Two heartbeats rather than one: the difference is astounding when it comes to the human mind.Absence of Woke Propaganda & NonsenseWhenever I browse the internet in any form, I grieve at the thought of how the woke propaganda is contaminating our minds day by day, trying to brainwash the normal human mentality with ideas of delusion to make the abnormal a norm by forcefeeding outrageous ideas down our throats. Black Myth Wukong, in all of its so-called ""controversies"", takes a step closer to our roots. Not toxic masculinity. Not sexism. Not lack of diversity. Just a pure journey that rids our bodies and minds of any sense of superiority, inferiority, representation, diversity, abnormalities, delusion, or any of that other nonsense. This is a game, in all of its glory, that takes us back to the roots of a character that embarks on a journey. That's it. Nothing more. Nothing less. And I'm all for more of it in the years/decades to come.Invisible Wall ImplementationSo... this one's a bit of a divisive issue. Most open world games implement an invisible wall feature to block off players from areas that are ""in the world"" but inaccessible in-game, primarily to help with immersion. Black Myth Wukong does this flawlessly to make it so the world is there in its entirety with no questionable areas whatsoever, enough so that it's impossible to tell which parts of the world are accessible and which are not. This is one of those rare situations wherein if the player would really benefit from a map that at least displays the general area. But add to the fact that there is no map to refer to, it can get annoying when exploring for chests and/or spirits.The reason this might be an arguable pro/con is that most game companies have been getting flack during the past few years for spoonfeeding players to go here and there with an overly complicated and detailed map/UI (I'm looking at you Ubisoft). Games like Elden Ring had a natural flow to exploration with the use of a map so players can just have a general idea of where they are. Black Myth Wukong took exploration to even higher levels of letting the player have the freedom to do what he wants, yet some may argue that in this case the use of clear invisible walls might have helped (ironically).Final Verdict: A+Nowadays, a game doesn't have to be perfect or even called ""superb"" to be worthy of praise. So many games drop the ball fast and hard, trying to stick political agenda into video games or going for greedy live-service routes that don't last more than a few months. Gamers may need to touch grass sometimes, but we're not always stupid or braindead either. Above all, we're a customer base looking to buy a product that provides enjoyment.The return of the singleplayer game with a strong foundation of lore and gameplay is what I believe put the gaming industry on the map in the first place. And now that the industry has tried its hand in so many possible paths to try to find the ""perfect route"" to a stable era of gaming, titles like Elden Ring, Nioh, Ghost of Tsushima, and now Black Myth Wukong have proven time and time again that the single player action-RPG has once again laid a solid foundation to the path that truly satisfies the core audience."

Positive,Top notch graphics with good stories and musics that bring out one of the best Chinese mythology! This game is designed to be with certain challenges for better game play. Might be hard for new players/ easy going player. Wouldn't recommend for players seeking for easy gameplay like me. :(But the effort to build this game I believe would be unbelievable. You have to experience yourself.
Positive,"""Reject humanity, go back to monke and BONK!"" It's a fun game to play, not as hard and challenging as Souls games except for some minibosses(After getting stronger you can come back and defeat them. I might have struggled because I was a bit stubborn but some of them really felt unfair.). The action is pretty good but both combos and spells lack variety. There are different stances but they only change your heavy attack, so you end up using the same light attack combo throughout the entire game. Some upgrades allow you to modify your light attacks but it's still not enough.Enemies between bosses feel too random and sometimes meaningless. Chapters 5 and 6 seem rushed for the deadline. I like the art style and the graphics are way too good. However, the worst thing about this game is the INVISIBLE WALLS.. there are too many of them and you can't go where you should actually be able to. There might be a better solution for this but it seems the game might have been rushed.In conclusion, the game is fun but doesn't deserve that price."
Positive,"After much anticipation, I finally had the chance to delve into Black Myth: Wukong. Here’s my take on this visually stunning yet somewhat uneven experience.Visuals and Art DirectionFrom the moment you step into the world of Black Myth: Wukong, it's hard not to be impressed. The game’s visual design is nothing short of extraordinary. Character models, environments, and special effects are meticulously crafted, reflecting a deep respect for Chinese mythology. The art direction captures both the otherworldly and culturally authentic aspects of its source material. Whether it's the detailed textures or the grandeur of the set pieces, the game feels like a living, breathing work of art. It’s clear that the developers poured their heart into these details.Combat: Exciting but RepetitiveThe combat in Black Myth: Wukong starts off exhilarating, combining elements from modern action games like Sekiro and Nioh. The fast-paced action and variety of abilities and transformations provide a thrilling experience. However, as you progress, the excitement begins to wane. The combat system becomes somewhat repetitive, with the same light attack combo being used extensively. Despite the initial variety, the stances and combos lack the depth needed to keep the action fresh over long stretches. Boss fights, though, are a highlight. Each encounter feels unique, and the sheer number of bosses is impressive, making these battles some of the game’s most engaging moments.Level Design: Visually Stunning but Lacking SubstanceWhile the game’s environments are visually striking, the level design often falls short. Chapters 2 and 3, in particular, feel like barren wastelands, with desert and snow areas that lack depth and density. The repetitive nature of the combat only exacerbates this issue, turning exploration into a sometimes tedious task. It’s a shame because the visuals promise so much, but the actual level layouts don’t always deliver.Story and AtmosphereThe story in Black Myth: Wukong is rooted in rich folklore but struggles to stand on its own. It relies heavily on the mythological background without crafting a compelling narrative of its own. The writing is vague, which might leave players who aren’t familiar with the source material feeling disconnected. However, the game’s atmosphere remains captivating, driven by its strong world-building and mythical elements. The setting and ambiance create an immersive experience, even if the story itself doesn’t quite hit the mark.Overall ImpressionsBlack Myth: Wukong is a game with clear highs and some noticeable lows. The visuals are spectacular, the boss design is top-notch, and the atmosphere is enchanting. Yet, the repetitive combat, lackluster level design, and a story that doesn’t quite engage detract from its overall impact. It’s a good game, but it doesn’t fully realize its potential. I’d rate it a 7 out of 10 – a solid and enjoyable experience with room for improvement.If you’re drawn to visually stunning games with engaging boss fights and a rich setting, Black Myth: Wukong is worth checking out. Just be prepared for some repetition along the way."
Positive,"Instant buy this game just to prove that: Chinese gaming industry > Woke + Sweet BabyNext time, any game you guys put in the terms ""Lacking in Inclusivity and Diversity"", we will 100% pre-order it."
Positive,Lacking in inclusivity and diversity. Just as expected. 10/10 GOTY
Positive,"10/10 would recommend this game, the second best thing that came out this year behind elden ring dlc. I have to give up sleep the first two day to play this game, the only thing that stop me is work T.TThe game start off very easy but the difficulty start increasing form each chapter. The difficulty increase gradually and without much difficulty spike. There are alot of boss in this game. The main boss and mini are very well design. The gameplay never get bored as you progress through the story And level up to unlock more skills."
Positive,"Is it the next coming of action games? No. It is a good game. But that nowadays is very rare, which means this is still an example to follow and a bar raised high. It is just a good game, but that means there are no crashes, it runs fine, it doesnt crash when alt tab-ing out, it didnt need day 1-2 patches to patchwork it into a functional state. ""It just works"". Story itself can be worlds away for people to immers into, but this wasn't made to be an introduction into the tale so that is to be expected. It is a good and fun game."
Positive,40 hrs in this game and despite of what people says about not having a map and performance issues and bla bla bla.. i wasn't bored for a second I had fun exploring the world and meeting NPCs with side quests which don't feel like a medicine pushed down your throat.. I'm on my final chapter now and won't mind coming back to this game again when i upgrade my PC to enjoy this game at its peak graphics 💞 thank you game science studios for putting this masterpiece together can't wait for a DLC from you guys
Positive,Smooth release. No problems with everything max in 4k on a 4080.Graphic is insane.Gameplay is fluid.World is linear but kinda open.Bosses look good.Difficulty is well chosen......  thats is for now :D
Positive,"The game is a visual feast filled with breathtaking combat and mesmerising music. Sometimes the cutscenes can be straight from movies. The game opens up slowly revealing our objectives and backstory about main characters through really well done animated shorts. Though more detailed information and complete lore can be found in the journal page that updates as you progress (similar to item description in souls game).The boss fights in this game is so well done that you never get bored even if the game throws boss at your face frequently and the boss designs, movesets, the details, their interaction/reaction to the player is one of the highlighting part of the game. Before playing it, I came across the news that there's a lot of boss in the game and I was worried. What if it starts becoming stale, fighting this many bosses but boy was I wrong. Opening fightHeadless guy with his bangersBest boi BajieThe stare down at enemies and walking slowly in the fight area which feels absolutely badassThe secret areas in every chapterA very rewarding explorationNimbus cloudEnd boss fightSecret ending boss fight(It's absolute cinema)The optimisation is really well done for an UE5 game though the final chapter had lot of stutters for me and also that chapter lacked things in comparison to previous chapters and it's the only chapter that didnot stick with me (except the boss fight who I still hate for being an absolute dick). That being said this is the GOTY for me though there are some really good games on the horizon."
Positive,"The TLDR version is, yes this is a GOOD game, but definitely not as great as everyone is making it out to be. Looks amazing, it's well optimised (compared to most crap on the market these days), and combat is mostly fun, but that's about where it stops for me. In summary, if you are simply looking for a fast paced martial arts/ ""Samurai"" style game and don't really care about it being new or hyped, I would recommend Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice over this any day.Here is why (the long version)...As a From Software fanboy and a souls-like veteran, I was excited to see something new and fresh to the genre, and something that may have been able to compete with the aforementioned Sekiro. Black Myth: Wukong starts off strong, but you quickly start to learn all the nuances about the game that make it down right frustrating and, for lack of a better word, crap... here is the list.- Invisible walls that stop you from exploring areas that look reachable. It gets old really fast.- There may be a cultural barrier, but the story is simply confusing, disjointed, and doesn't really make sense. It is filled with so much random crap that I stopped caring and started skipping most of the cut-scenes. Not to mention some of the really annoying side characters. I got the main premise of it, but man it was a slog to get through.- The combat is fast and entertaining, but I would not call it 'crisp' or skill-based. Without writing a 20 page essay on why, just know that you will get 'ripped off' MANY times with missed button presses, interrupted moves, bulls#&t enemy move sets, unavoidable AOE, and just flat out 'cheating' by the bosses. I felt like the combat was too luck-based to be called 'well designed'.- There are too many 'bosses'. It also gets old real fast. Not to mention, towards mid-game, they just stop dying/ being defeated. They will often flee or just start some random dialog with you before leaving. The satisfaction of ass-kicking gets taken away from you.- Traversal is tedious and sometimes gets you killed. There is a type of auto-mantle feature that sometimes forces you to jump down ledges you didn't want to. Some of the spawn points are really far from the arena where you died and running there is really annoying.(Gear Progression in summary: There is a lot of stuff to acquire in this game, but a lot of it feels really pointless.)- Gear progression is flat-out enraging! For example, there is one armour set that you unlock for crafting quite early, but you don't find all of the materials until much later in the story progression. If you are a completionist like me, it took roughly 20 hours or more to finally craft it! Yes, I could have skipped a bunch of stuff and got the materials, but that many hours is just ridiculous! I kept thinking to myself, ""Oh yeah, it can't be far off now."" This also carries over to upgrading. Another slogfest to get high-end materials.- Gear progression cont... When you finally do get a piece of gear that you think is going to be amazing, it usually comes with a negative effect or such a small benefit that just makes it not worth it equipping. The game forces you into certain gear for the set bonuses and towards the late-game you just end up using whatever is best. In the late-game, you get a bunch of different gear that gets thrown at you and makes you wonder why you spent your hard earned money/ materials on the other crap. Yes you can make 'random builds' but they are very limited if you actually want to be 'powerful'.- The skill progression is quite good, but also has some pointless aspects to it. You have 3 different stances for combat, but the gear is usually focused around one of them, making it utterly pointless to switch between them. Again, focusing you into whichever is best for the time. Same goes for your sub-items as well, usually focusing on one particular skill or spell that makes the others pointless. The fact that re-specing is free and easy is a really good part of this game, but honestly I just ran the whole game with one stance at a time. It feels like the game wants you to experiment with different builds and skills, but it is just not worth it.To finalise: I really struggled to recommend this game, but I have a personal rule that if I have a decent amount of hours or have completed it, it must have been worth it. If you are expecting 'crisp' skill-based combat, like some other games in similar genres, I would not recommend this. You will end up breaking something. It is a really good game from a developer's first 'big title', but they missed the mark on so many things that it just made it frustrating to play for me. It's almost like they 'tried to hard' and added a lot of unnecessary crap, which just ends up conflicting with enjoying the game. Anyway, sorry to ramble, but I felt it needed to be said. People are praising this game way too hard."
Positive,"Finally!  This is a game for the every man, in that you can just play a bit at a time without feeling like an endless, and daunting, grind. Great graphics, sound, gameplay, and mechanics.  Really no complaints yet."
Positive,"Reject modern audiences, return to MONKE!"
Positive,"Finally a game that really feel fresh and unique still can't believe this game is real and delivered exactly what was shown in so many trailers. So many games show amazingly but endup looking nothing like the demos but this game delivered. Love the story, the atmosphere and simple gameplay.The graphics are really the cherry on top. The only thing it could do better was adding a map, but since the game is linear, it doesn't matter that much. Sure it's not an open world game, but they never claimed it was. It's not a soulslike game like so many were claiming, its just a singleplayer action game with tough bossfights.A remarkable achievement, especially considering it's the first AAA title from a new studio in the industry and from China. Honestly, one of the best games I've played in this year so far. A true masterpiece nonetheless."

Positive,"After 20 something hours in the game I think I finally have a better grasp on what the games about now. If you want the TLDR of it then I'd say the game is worth picking up, whilst the game certainly has its quirks, it also has really solid gameplay, amazing graphics and a surprisingly compelling story-line for those willing to look deeper into the game. I'd say those reasons make the game worth trying if nothing else.For those interested in hearing me ramble for a bit, I'd say that this game really wasn't anything that I expected it to be, someone likened it to Chinese God of War, and I’ll admit I can understand why, the levelling system and limited weapons options are very reminiscent of God of War 2018 with attacks and movies being very weighty and full of depth. Personally, I initially thought of game like lies of p with its linear map design and story chapters but the longer I’ve played this the more I’ve realised that Black myth Wukong is a game that subverts expectations.In the beginning I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of challenge that enemies presented, I thought that the enemies died too quickly and that you had way too much stamina to really strategize with your moves, so combat felt button mashy with no real depth since “ you could easily dodge everything, like,  it wasn’t as if you’d run of stamina anyway” and this made the otherwise cool levelling system useless since I already felt overpowered. Then I encountered wandering wight (the second mini boss) and realised that you needed to have that much stamina otherwise you can’t even participate in the battles much less win.Then I felt that the game just had too many boss battles, so much so that with how linear the game was it felt like it was a boss rush game with very little to explore or lore to encounter, just boss battle then cutscene a then further boss battles, but this couldn’t be further from the case. While the game has a strong focus on boss battles, it also has many storylines, quests, even hidden lore, cutscenes and entirely new maps to explore for anyone interested in looking. The thing is though, the game is more than happy to have you miss these huge bits of content, the lack of an in-game map and the many invisible walls also make it a little challenging to notice initially but when you do you realise there is a lot more to the game than initially seems with content far more engaging than you’d have thought.The game subverts these expectations over and over until you start wondering if the flaw you notice in the game is really a flaw or if it's something that's been addressed and you just haven’t gotten far enough or looked deeply enough for it to be resolved. This is the reason that I thought I had to play for a bit before I could comment on it and after so many hours, I think I get finally get it. I can honestly recommend this as a game worth trying and many only real complaints with it are the often-obnoxious invisible walls and the lack of a player hub of some sort that's unanimously safe. that and the sharpening feature on fsr that makes the images look so much worse. but overall game of the year"
Positive,"it is really good overall, graphics are obviously amazing but tech-wise this game actually excels at mid-boss transitions with really polished animations, stunts and lots of tricky gimmicks in the second half of the campaigncombat is also great but imo it works better with bosses than mobs since what you ultimately do is build up focus points to spend on heavy attacks and thats more fun to do while dodging constantlylikewise story is nice cause as i said cutscenes are really polished and character interactions are interesting and zhu bajie has some funny quirks on him, but also you need some background in order to understand some of the bosses' struggles and such, i guess if youre familiar with journey to the west you might catch some more extra insighti also think this game does a fantastic job at portraying the chinese mythos and daoist iconography, some of the latter areas are really evocative and really makes you see how many faces buddha can have. For me personally this is excellent at portraying cultural background and a massive leap forward for the wuxia genrei think if they ever make a sequel it would benefit from some platforming elements and maybe a little more puzzle solving as the zones that connect each boss get a bit shallow sometimes by chapters 4 through 6performance is decent, i managed to run somewhat stable 60 fps on my rtx 3080 i9-10900k clocking at default speeds, it has frame generation options too even for non-nvidia graphics cards"

Positive,"Disclaimer: I’m still making my way through the game, but after playing a few chapters, it’s clear that this game is something special.The game reminds me a lot of Sekiro, the environments, the absence of a traditional stats leveling system, and the way you increase your core attributes, mana, and health. It also brings to mind Nioh 2, with the ability to equip spirits and its fast-paced gameplay that blends combos and stances seamlessly.The storyline is captivating, brought to life with cartoonish cutscenes brimming with personality. It’s based on Journey to the West, and the game’s polish is evident throughout. The GUI is beautifully designed, sound effects hit just right, and the soundtrack is solid.You play as a pre-made character to stay true to the storyline from the ancient Chinese novel. Armor and weapons are obtained through crafting with resources and currency you collect along the way. Flasks can be customized with items that give you temporary advantages, like increased defense or healing over time.Black Myth: Wukong doesn’t rely on traditional stats like endurance, strength, or agility. It offers a skill-based system. You unlock and enhance skills, switching between stances to explore different playstyles. Respeccing is quick and painless, letting you experiment without needing any annoying items, so you’re always in the action, ready to try something new.When you die, there’s no soul-dropping. Seriously, who actually enjoys that feature? I’m glad they left it out.However, the game does have some invisible map walls, and navigation can be a bit confusing at times and to me this is the biggest issue this game has so far.The game kicks off strong, with great enemy variety, stunning maps, and a slew of unique bosses. The difficulty feels fair, not cheap like in Elden Ring.You can equip trinkets, but you’ll stick with the same weapon, which you can modify and upgrade. There are no other weapons, but that doesn’t take away from the experience.You’ll need a high-end PC to run this game smoothly, especially if you crank up the settings. It could use some optimization, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Denuvo is causing performance issues.Voice acting is on point, and there are some interesting mechanics like transforming into an insect, bird, or fox, which adds a nice layer of variety.Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a fantastic achievement. It’s got me excited to see what this studio does next. This game deserves its success, and I’m giving it a solid 9 out of 10."
Positive,"""A nearly perfect masterpiece and work of art, an unmissable adventure in Chinese mythology, and a unique story that narrates themes of mission and growth, love and courage, breaking the cycle of fate, and fighting for the well-being of all!""  ""Black Myth: Wukong"" can be described as an exceptionally outstanding piece of art. Whether it’s the smooth combat experience, rich combat techniques, magical artifacts, diverse bosses, or the exquisite graphics and delightful music—everything is truly remarkable. ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is undoubtedly one of the best games currently available!In ""Black Myth: Wukong,"" players can switch between three different staff techniques at any time during combat. Each technique is suitable for dealing with various types of minor enemies, bosses, and larger foes. Additionally, there are multiple skills available, such as ""Stun Technique,"" ""Invisibility,"" and ""Boss Transformation,"" along with specific weapons designed to counter particularly challenging enemies.However, a minor drawback is that the game lacks pre-input commands, making the ""Counter"" mechanism dependent on the player's memory of boss attacks, quick judgment, and timing during strikes. This can make it difficult to trigger the ""Counter,"" and dodging may sometimes feel sluggish. Fortunately, this issue can be mitigated by replacing the staff with a spear.You can't help but admire how beautiful the music, in-game visuals, and chapter animations are, allowing players to immerse themselves in the mythical world of ancient China. If you have the budget, I highly recommend purchasing the upgraded DLC to enjoy the in-game music album!The story of ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is primarily told through fragmented narratives. However, by reading the in-game background stories and combining them with the original novel ""Journey to the West,"" you will be amazed to discover that the game not only includes personal growth and struggle but also embodies the revolutionary spirit inherited from the predecessor (Sun Wukong), fighting to break the cycle and striving for the happiness, equality, and freedom of the common people. Additionally, by exploring each character’s background story, players can gain a profound understanding of the vast worldview set in ""Black Myth,"" including the greed, anger, love, and the true goodness of every monster, character, and deity.""Black Myth: Wukong"" is undoubtedly a near-perfect piece of art and is well worth purchasing and experiencing!"
Positive,"I just finished chapter 2 at this time of the review and I already am convinced that this game is an absolute masterpiece, this product is exactly why games are made. No Corpo rats scamming their community with cheap copies like for example the CoD series and don't even get me started on Ubisoft, probably the worst gaming company on earth as of 2024. This is a real game. This gives real dopamine. Play it and I promise you that this game will forget you spent 60 bucks on it unlike most of the titles on steam which will have you regret spending that kinda money.EDIT: After finishing Chapter: 4, I just want to say that if this isn't the game of the year then the gaming industry has officialy failed. Thank you and your welcome."
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong is an absolute masterclass of a game. All the hype, all the praise, all the positive buzz surrounding this game...they're absolutely deserved and this is hands down, one of THE best games of this generation, not just this year. The combat, fluidity of animations, the level and boss design, the intricate level and environmental design, all the different characters and enemies, they're all very unique, varied and superbly crafted. When you take control of the Monkey King (Sun Wukong) you really feel the power behind that staff and every swing you make against your enemies. I won't spoil the details but the gameplay mechanic is very rich and varied and rewarding. There's a whole level up system that can be used to power up your abilities and spells which can be used in subsequent battles. This btw is not necessarily a souls-like game even though some mechanics are present there but the combat style is very fast and responsive. I'm only just scratching the surface of the game and trust me when I say, this is one of the best action RPG games I've ever played in a good while and easily among to very best the game industry has to offer. Easily a 10/10 for me. Well done Game Science for creating such a well-crafted masterpiece. You deserve all the success and praise."
Positive,"I have to admit, I was initially both skeptical and very intrigued by Black Myth: Wukong. The trailers, especially the stunning 2021 showcase for the Chinese New Year, certainly grabbed my attention. Now that it’s finally here—what a ride!The combat system in Black Myth: Wukong is one of its standout features. It’s fluid, lightning-fast, incredibly responsive, and offers an impressive range of options. Whether you prefer quick dodges, precise parries, or unleashing a flurry of attacks, the system keeps you on your toes, and mastering it is highly rewarding. Progressing through the skill tree feels empowering, as each new ability unlocks more depth and variety in how you can approach battles. There's a real sense of growth as you master the mechanics and refine your playstyle.Though it’s not an open-world game, Black Myth: Wukong more than makes up for that with its gorgeously crafted universe. Every environment is steeped in rich detail, drawing from Chinese folklore with an incredible level of care and precision. The world feels alive—thanks to stellar modeling and animation. The sheer visual spectacle is something to behold; you might even find yourself pausing mid-battle just to admire the scenery (before promptly getting smacked by an enemy, of course).Now, onto the minor downsides: I was hoping for more exploration. The game feels a bit more linear than I anticipated, and I found myself wishing for more opportunities to venture off the beaten path. Additionally, the combat—while exhilarating—sometimes suffers from visual overload. Effects are so abundant that they can make battles a bit disorienting.Despite these small criticisms, Black Myth: Wukong is an incredible triumph. The combat system is a joy to engage with, and the imaginative, vibrant world is captivating. Game Science has done a phenomenal job, and I can’t wait to see what comes next from this team!/!\ ""GOLD"" on ProtonDB, playable, but quite heavy on Steam Deck. It runs better than I thought, but still barely hits 40FPS with several compromises. I wouldn't recommend playing it on the Steam Deck.https://www.protondb.com/app/2358720"
Positive,A monkey that isn't black kills women as boss fights = trash game (krappa)
Positive,"Best graphics I've ever played in a game with rtx 4090, also the story is great if you read or watch the TV show of Journey to the West beforehand."
Positive,"The game is a solid 10/10 for me, personally, otherwise I wouldn't have finished it 5 times and done all the achievements. There isn't anything in the game that I haven't enjoyed. Graphics, story, combat, the Chinese setting, everything clicked with me and I had real fun every singular minute spent in the game. The only thing the game could have improved is letting players enjoy all the equipment earlier in the game and the fact that there is no enough resources to upgrade everything you want in a single playthrough is a little bit frustrating. You get so many cool things so late in the game, you simply do not have enough time playing with them. I guess they had more chapters planned but they couldn't implement everything they had in mind."
Positive,"Spent 10 hours with Black Myth: Wukong so far, and it’s been an incredible experience. This game truly shines, offering stunning visuals, a rich cultural backdrop, and one of the most engaging, top-notch combat systems I’ve ever encountered. While I’ve read that some AMD users have experienced crashes and bugs, which can be a bit of a downer for them, my experience on an RX 7900 XTX with the recommended graphic settings has been flawless—the performance is as smooth as silk. I also tested it on the Steam Deck, where I ran into a few bugs, but nothing that seriously impacted the overall experience. Absolutely worth the investment ... if you can tolerate a few technical hiccups."

Positive,"As China's first AAA game presented to the world by Game Science, Black Myth: Wukong has captivated me with its stunning visual effects, meticulously crafted character animations, profound and restrained narrative style, and its touching storyline, which pays homage to the literary classic Journey to the West. Despite the recent controversies surrounding the game, in my heart, it lives up to the expectations of countless Chinese and international players over the past four years, just like a modern Chinese poem describes: 金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。 (The golden monkey rises, wielding a mighty staff, Clearing the skies of dust and shadows vast.) 今日欢呼孙大圣，只缘妖雾又重来。 (Today we cheer for the Great Sage once more,For the demon mist has returned to our door.)"
Positive,"This game has the big awesome set pieces and aesthetic from the old school God of War games, the core gameplay of a Soul-like (albeit a tad more forgiving), really sick and fast paced Sekiro / Bloodborne combat, and every cool Kung Fu thing you can think of ever all mixed into one.Only a short bit in but this may be my GOTY. It also looks fantastic and runs surprisingly well (7800x3d + 3080 ti, getting 70-90 fps with RT off and everything on Very High).Very strong recommend out the gate. I have to stop playing and go to bed but I want more badly.edit: Played it a bit more at lunch and still enjoying it. The first boss f-ed me up a few times but overall this is easier than a FromSoft game. I also am really enjoying the quick spells / form changes, seems to add a nice diversity to the combat and strategy."
Positive,"Monkey beat big head child, monkey steal big head child wristband, monkey tries pet big dog wolf.......Monkey dead."
Positive,"10 minutes in, and I think I'm a Monkey God. My mouse agrees, and now I'm craving peaches. 🐒🍑Highly recommend this game."
Positive,"Truly a masterpiece in design and over-the-top delivery in showcasing Chinese mythology. The combat system is deeply satisfying, blending traditional hack-and-slash mechanics along with a very unique ability ""Transformation"", which allows you to take on the form of powerful foes. Each boss fight is vastly different and very fun to play against. The final climax towards the end of the game is absolutely phenomenal and I am in love with how well it was executed (sequence of integrated-cutscenes with playability as the MC).I believe this game will receive GOTY for sure."
Positive,I am at an age where i dont have time to invest in long story games or even difficult ones. But after trying this game Black Myth Wukong i have become invested and i am on my second run that it was so unprecedented of how much i enjoyed playing this game. The story is very interesting if you dig into the lore and how refreshing is if you figure out your destiny as the destined one. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for something different that is nostalgic in how old games were in plain game playing and figuring the game out while going through the motions of the games challenges.
Positive,"I know no one’s probably going to read this “review,” but hey, here goes!I absolutely love this game—it had me hooked from the start. The intro video was super cool, giving you a taste of the action right away with a quick battle.Visually, this might just be the most stunning game I’ve ever played. The gameplay? Rock-solid. And the sound design? Top-notch!Now, I’ve never been great at Souls-like games, and to be honest, they’ve never really been my thing. But the combat system here feels pretty close to games like Elden Ring, which isn’t a bad thing at all.It’s a solid 9/10 from me!"
Positive,"Every review is subjective and aligns with the perception, tastes, preferences and/or interests of the person writing it. I’m someone who views video games as another form of artistic expression, which is why I do NOT assign a score, I don't believe art can be measured or quantified, I’ll simply share my personal experience while avoiding spoilers as much as possible. Overall, I found the game to be quite good. For someone who hasn't read the story of Journey to the West, I really enjoyed how it's presented here, especially the cinematics included in each chapter, I'll just say that if you appreciate animation as a medium of cinematic expression, you’ll likely enjoy them as well. I decided to purchase this game for two simple reasons: Dragon Ball (inspired by Journey to the West) and Elden Ring. The first one is my past, and the second is my present, and the surprise was quite pleasant. Although the game was heavily touted as being similar to the souls-like genre, I only noticed two aspects: the save points (similar to bonfires or graces) and the way some NPCs’ stories are told (characters who provide you with bits of information and whom you encounter repeatedly as you progress).In terms of gameplay, Wukong is more akin to a hack and slash than a souls-like, you could reference God of War and perhaps Sekiro, I mean its progression system is broad and accesible, it's frenetic, challenging, but above all, fun. What I didn’t like is the lack of a parry mechanic, there’s only one mechanic that rewards you for dodging at the right time. For me, the game’s strong point is the number and variety of bosses (over 80), there’s only one boss that repeats in design, but not in its move set, which I greatly appreciate.The world of Black Myth is unique and beautiful, with a different map for each chapter. The downside is that at times it feels somewhat empty, I think they could have placed more difficult enemies or additional content in certain areas, as sometimes exploration doesn’t feel as rewarding.The music library is quite extensive and original, with over 70 tracks, most of which are very good. My personal recommendations are: ""Celestial Symphony"", ""Nonsense!"", ""If Good And Evil Gain No Due"", ""Flames Have Paved My Way”, ""Destiny"", ""It Was You"", ""Monkey Mind,"" ""The Greatest Yaoguai"", ""Where Lies The Path Ahead"", and especially ""Listen Not"".My conclusion, I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of accessible hack and slash games, good graphics (which, for me, aren’t a major factor), animation, narrative that sometimes leaves out details, oriental ambient music, and above all, Chinese culture. However,  I do not recommend the Deluxe Edition,the content is entirely in-game (like the music), and the items (weapons and armor) become completely obsolete after the first chapter.This is one of the best games of the year, and it could become the best hack and slash on Steam, but who knows, Ragnarök is coming..."
Positive,western game developers and woke reviewers fear the monkey
Positive,"""This game taught me to git gud.""Not trying to be bias here, but the game's a blessing in a way for most of us, as JTTW fans. To be fair I've not watched the OG 1986 Journey to the West, only 96' TVB version and some other films.. it may not be the greatest adaptation, however I did enjoy the show as a kid. Been waiting for the game since the first trailer around 4 years ago, it did not disappoint.Timeline is set after JTTW, basically like a sequel, the story seemed to be very well-thought-out. A masterpiece, I'd say. The lore and backstory may be confusing for players who aren't familiar with JTTW though, some are explained in the ""Journal"", they're long but pretty interesting read. It's not perfect still, due to some flaws such as some minor lighting bugs, camera angles on certain fights and invisible walls in most areas. Game design is alright, there is no map nor indicator so it may be an issue for anyone with fish memory and/or just couldn't travel around the place much due to time constraint. Just don't go diving into the game expecting it to be like some sort of chill RPG, or wise you'd be greatly disappointed. You don't get to beat small baddies much, because you'll run into bosses as you progress the story. Game completion time varies, main story can be completed in less than 50 hours, it would definitely go higher if you'd also do other objectives. Do note that some quests/objectives are highly missable in the run. Game visual looks absolutely stunning, the animations and arts are very impressive too. Soundtracks are great, especially the final boss part. Combat is pretty decent, great variety of abilities to choose from. Often times activating abilities and healing feels like there's a delay to it though, perhaps that's just how it's intended to be in the game. Difficulty-wise it starts off souls-like kinda style, but as the player progress on upgrading better stats after (presumably around Chapter 2-3) it will eventually feel more of a hack n' slash.. I find some of the bosses are tough to beat still. Nevertheless I've beaten the game (aside from missing a few quests) at 110+- hours with Spell Bind most of the time, occasionally with a few stat boost from medicine. There's just lots of stuff to do in the game, that said it's quite time consuming for achievement hunters.Despite some of those mentioned flaws but the game's easily 10/10 for me. Would recommend if you up for some challenges and are into boss-rush kinda game."
Positive,"After i've done two ends of this game. I'll be forced to do a positive review.Better than others AAA games launched this year, no cap here, better than DD2 and Helldivers2. Yellowbrow is one of biggest cheap designs i ever saw in my life.Boss literally kept spamming his invicible move on him, took me a lot of tries until the RNG stopped f***** w/ me, In another end, wukong final boss which has perfect dodge i bypassed first try, so the balancing in this game is pretty funny to not say bad.- Chapter 1-2-5-6 exploration were really good and smooth, yet chapter 3 and 4 walking the maps and finding the secrets paths was a pain in the arse, like a REAL pain! Specially third chapter i think it took me three days to fully do everything in chapter three KEK.- Ray tracing improves next to nothing at cinematic settings besides eating 20fps for myself, i would recommend people with good hardware focusing in cinematic preset instead as i had a stable 58-72fps with everything maxed. at 3440x1440.- The invisible walls looks like climbable areas, and it was funny and annoying at the same time, having to deal with it. Anything else besides the Cons really.-  Ultrawide support+cutscene support. ~ anime cutscenes doens't has UW support yet, i mean it was a really interesting take, everytime you beat a chapter it would tell a fragment of wukong story with a nice chinese song playing+a different artstyle for each one.- Gameplay, i think after you get to lvl 100, you can really tweak your builds for your necessity.  It has highly custom loadouts in skills, you can spent and refund points for free. So you're free to choose and tweak your playstyle anytime of the game.-Cosmetics, while it doesn't offer transmogs, you can upgrade any craftable armor set to highest tear, if you like a passive effect of one armor instead of another in a new chapter. In chapter 3 you unlock this feature. Be it the cosmetic look you prefer in a old model, or useful bonus for your build you can keep that armor for the rest  of the game until mythcial tear!  - While the weapons movesets follow three patterns, end game weapons have unique effects, such as sprounting lava from the ground or spawning swords from thrust stance. -The story itself is good with the osts being great too.-  FOUR HEAVELY KINGS IS PEAK GAMING FIGHTING, I even felt my testo levels rising up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           - Graphics were really good, using nvidia filters went one step above too.tl;dr"
Positive,"I am a player who pre ordered this game, so I carefully paid attention to the shortcomings in the reviews of this game by media such as IGN. But after playing for 5 hours, I can responsibly say that these reviews are crap. They claim that the game's plot is boring, there are too few enemies, there are too few skills, there is not much collection,etc. It's all bullshit, the only point is that they didn't  play this game seriously. From beginning to end, they played with an arrogant attitude,  of course, they couldn't discover anything or feel anything. Bro, play this game seriously, and to your heart's content. It will definitely surprise you. Last but not least, don't have too many concerns about the performance of this game. Even if you set the picture quality to medium, you can still enjoy a great visual experience."
Positive,"Sun Wukong is my favorite character in mythology. I loved watching Journey to the West when I was a kid and I remember this masterpiece deeply. So far, no game developer has made a 3A game based on Journey to the West. ""Game Science"" is the first Chinese game developer to dare to make such a symbolic work. It is really amazing. No matter what style this work reflects, I will look forward to it and buy it on every platform.

Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a visually stunning action RPG that brings Chinese mythology to life. The game’s graphics are breathtaking, with detailed environments and fluid character animations that make each battle feel epic. The combat system is both challenging and rewarding, offering a mix of strategic thinking and fast-paced action. The story, inspired by the classic Journey to the West, is engaging and full of intriguing lore. While the gameplay is intense and satisfying, some may find it slightly repetitive over time. However, the overall experience is immersive, making it a must-play for fans of action RPGs and mythology-based narratives.10/10if you love Elden Ring/Dark Souls is must have to get Monkey game too"
Positive,"I just finished the game and holy it's peak easily 10/10the gameplay is so good, the soundtrack are unnoticeable sometimes but there's some good soundtracksthe world is just so beautiful the start of the game is so good it makes you wanna continuethe bosses were boring at the first two acts but after that the game get so much betterthe acts designs are complicated sooo complicated but they have alot of good visuals the final boss was just peaki really hope it gets the game of the year they've done a really good job for their first game"
Positive,"This is much closer to DMC and Sekiro. If you expect Dark Souls / Elden Ring, you will be disappointed.So far, looks and plays great.Also, english voice acting is pretty good, apart from the main character, he sounds much better in chinese, IMO."
Positive,"Masterpiece!Any Asians in their 30s who used to watch Journey to the west with Dicky Cheung after school back in the day here? You must play this game! Fulfill your childhood dream! (Just me? nvm)If you haven't played this game, don't miss out! It's amazing!"
Positive,"Masterpiece! Beautiful art and great gameplay. Even though the game is quite linear, the game world is massive with a large variety of unique bosses. Some bosses are relatively easy, some are tough and require some practice. A lot of different skills to unlock, items to collect and fun characters to meet."
Positive,"An early review, because I feel external factors might necessitate it.  Reminds me to Nioh the most, one of my favorite games, albeit easier (so far). Is fast, fluid and really fun to play. On a 3080 at 3440x1440 (UW), 60 fps, high settings and with DLSS at 75%, I have had 0 Issues on the first level. I think I've had caught just 2 very minor strutters and both in cutscenes, I've heard that from the 3rd level onwards performance dips, but can't comment on that as of yet.Voice acting is great in English, although lip sync is quite bad.  Amazing and dense, art direction is top notch and even on high setings I think quality is great.For a title of this caliber on a young studio is an impressive result. I'm glad we still got games like this since western studios doesn't seem capable or interested anymore of doing so and Asia is where is at, between this, stellar blade, rise of ronin, and dragons dogma 2, this year has been great for hack and slash games and alike."
Positive,"Journey to the West's cool story development in a game with highly detailed visuals.I also recommend you to not skip the entire music video.Many people say that this is not a soul-like game.But, I think it's still a souls-like game, even many friendly features like no soul dropping mechanism (including no death penalty), many unbalanced skills that much effective against bosses, you could also “over level” the boss, and then instant (but still satisfying) dodge, etc, etc.However, this makes the game easier to be enjoyed by new players who have never played a souls-like game before as well as existing souls-like players.The things I note are bad (maybe just for me) in this game are that you can't find safe points easily from a distance, and the controls in driving the cloud are bad (there is an ascend button but no descend button).And again, since this is a ""boss rush"" game (even not every boss is an actual boss I think), you could get more relieved and satisfying feeling in defeating a boss as in a souls-like game."
Positive,"I don't typically buy AAA games on release, and especially not for full price. but this time I made an exception."
Positive,IGN SUCKS. 10/10
Positive,Awesome gameplay and great introduction to Ancient Chinese culture
Positive,"Simply breathtaking. The game  has a great and immersive environment. The the sound fits into the environment and, was well thought of. There is a lot to see and explore and, I would absolutely recommend this game 10/10 for me."
Positive,"I finished the game yesterday, including a good portion of a NG+ playthrough to ""clean"" the remaining achievements, and I have to say that with very few exceptions I've been impressed more and more with it with every passing hour.It's not without its share of flaws (what game is, really?), but as first effort from a newly formed studio this was nothing short of an outstanding achievement.Solid and mostly satisfying combat, good level design with tons of branching paths and secrets to uncover, staggering amount AND variety of content (with an absurd number of very distinctive boss fights), excellent production value and cinematography across the board, decent level of challenge from some of the toughest bosses (I think goddamn Erlang made me piss way more blood than anything in a FromSoft game so far), etc, etc.Personally the only glaring issues I can point and the things I'd like to see improved in their future games are:- they should work on ways to eliminate or mask their ""invisible walls"" more seamlessly. Stumbling on one currently can be fairly jarring, especially because it seems to be an almost unnecessary oversight, given the overall technical prowess of the game.- the formula would benefit from having more advanced navigation and traversal options unlocked over time (Metroidvania-style). You know... double jumping, a grappling hook, breaking special walls, that sort of stuff.- While the combat is more good than bad (at least good enough to count as a net positive for the game) I would appreciate if they could make everything a bit tighter: better sense of impact on receiving and landing hits, clearer""tells"" from enemy moves, a bit less ""visual noise"" in the most frantic moments of action.On a side note, I have no idea why so many reviewers insist on stressing that ""this isn't really a Souls-like"", because I can't think of any other series that it resembles more closely.The way the content is paced, the checkpoint system, the fact that everything except bosses respawns if you die or rest, how healing and consumable work... These are all almost a 1:1 match to most From Software title, and even the camera, lock-on system and combat are way closer to a Sekiro than they are to, say, a God of War or Devil May Cry.Anyway, to say I was pleased with the time I spent on the game would be an understatement.It's currently an easy candidate for my personal GOTY 2024 with nothing in sight ready to challenge it (but I have yet to play a remaining good half of Shadow of the Elder Tree). I'll be there for whatever this studio comes up with next.Well, at least in the hope they'll capitalize on what they learned here if they don't decide to swap genre entirely."
Positive,"Ohh, so that is Rafiki's Origin story"
Positive,Playing this game gives me the urge to talk about the Chinese gaming development conditions and feminist propaganda
Positive,"Its Game of the Year 2024. This game delivers an experience so exceptional that it feels like a well-deserved slap in the face to certain Western developers and reviewers who criticized it.Wukong is simply too good, weaving a rich narrative that pulls you deep into the mystical world of Chinese mythology. It’s rare to find a game that not only captivates you with its plot but also keeps you engaged through its brilliant execution.Unreal Engine 5, the game pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in gaming graphics today. The visual fidelity is jaw-dropping, with every detail, from the smallest blade of grass to the most epic boss fights, rendered in stunning clarity. The environments are so immersive that you can almost feel the atmosphere and textures around you.The game also excels in its combat mechanics, though only a few boss fights truly test your skills. While some may find these battles challenging, they are a perfect blend of strategy and action, rewarding players who master the game’s intricacies.In a world where many games are starting to feel formulaic, Black Myth: Wukong stands out as a bold and innovative title. It fully utilizes the power of Unreal Engine 5 to deliver not just the best graphics of the year, but also an experience that feels new and exciting. This game is a testament to the talent and vision of its developers and a must-play for anyone looking for a truly unforgettable gaming experience.and do check my yt for some gameplay i have defeated every single boss of this game on - JPxDee"

Positive,"This is not the traditional type of game that I play.  I usually like turn-based games like X-Com.  As I have gotten older (I'm now 61 years old), I have avoided FPS and any games that relies on fast accurate reflexes and reaction times.  I am just terrible at those types of games.However, I am also an ABC (American Born Chinese) and was intrigued by the rave reviews that Black Myth: Wukong was getting.  I am not familiar with the ""Journey to the West"" stories either and I thought it would be cool to play this game to learn a little bit of my heritage.Okay, long story short:  I am having a ton of fun playing this game.  Right now, I'm at about 37 hours and I am at the beginnings of Chapter 2 so I'm taking a long leisurely time playing it (also because this is not the typical type of game that I play so I'm not good at it compared to a lot of other people).To my surprise, I have been successful at beating more bosses and getting further into the game than I thought possible.  I sort of expected to be stuck at the first boss and eventually quit in frustration.However, the game seems to allow the user to eventually be able to beat any boss by allowing us to gain experience (to gain skills) and freely rearrange our skills so that we eventually get to the point where we can beat a boss.  At least, that's my hope.And it's really satisfying when you do beat a boss.   I have encountered 2 or 3 bosses where it took me awhile to either figure out how (or be lucky enough or gain enough skills) to eventually beat them.  If you encounter a boss you can't beat, you can just go around beating lesser opponents until you can level up and gain a skill that might help.  And I have encountered some bosses where I was able to beat them on the first try.I am fearful that I will eventually encounter a boss that I can't beat and quit the game.  I hope that with patience, I will be able to beat all the bosses I encounter and be able to finish the game.  I really hope that I can finish the game.The game is very polish and beautiful.  It even plays and looks great on lesser hardware (I'm playing with an Intel Arc A380).   I'm having a lot of fun and I find the story to be interesting (although a lot of times I don't really know what is going on since I am not familiar with the source material).  It has given me interest in learning more about the source material it is based on.  I'll probably end up watching some of those Journey to the West movies with Stephen Chow (I did see one awhile ago and I remember that I thought it was very funny and entertaining but I will probably enjoy it more now as I slowly learn more about the Monkey King myth)Overall, I do highly recommend this game."

Positive,"This game is nothing short of spectacular! It’s visually stunning, beautifully crafted, and offers a unique blend of thrilling fights, breathtaking views, and engaging combat.Before deciding to buy and play 'Black Myth: WuKong', I did some thorough research to determine if it lives up to the hype. While I found many positive reviews, I also came across several criticisms and complaints that made me reconsider. My advise is 'Don’t let negativity sway you' and here’s why you shouldn’t be deterred with these comments:-Trailers look too good to be true: Sometimes trailers can seem misleading, but this game truly lives up to the hype.-It doesn’t look like a Souls game: Some people argue that if it’s not a Souls game, it won’t be enjoyable. However, while Souls games aren’t for everyone, this one offers its own fun, challenge, and rewards.-It looks like a Souls game: Others might complain about another Souls-like game. While it’s challenging, it’s more forgiving compared to other Souls games that can be punishingly difficult.-It might be too short (15 hours of gameplay): While some may worry about the length, the game actually offers much more content than anticipated.-It’s not an open-world game: Though it’s not an open-world game, it’s also not overly linear. There’s plenty of exploration and hidden areas to discover.-It’s a boss rush game: While it features many bosses, it’s also packed with smaller enemies and challenges that keep the gameplay exciting.It seems some critics are quick to judge without giving the game a fair chance. If you’re on the fence, I assure you it’s worth it, especially if you’ve enjoyed the Sun Wukong character from TV series. Playing as him brings a wonderful sense of nostalgia and excitement.In summary, this game is a fantastic experience and definitely worth your time!"

Positive,"After spending 113 hours exploring every corner of the game, I’m finally ready to write a review and share my personal opinion on the debut triple-A game by ""Game Science"".In a nutshell, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a wonderful game with a varied combat system, a stunning world, great sound, and captivating characters drawn from Chinese folklore. Now, let’s dive into the details:Story & LoreThe game's roots lie in Chinese folklore, specifically based on the book ""Journey to the West"". Throughout the game, we encounter many characters who appeared in the original story, with their development further explored here. Before ""Black Myth: Wukong"" was released, many expected that we’d play as the real Monkey King, Sun Wukong. However, we actually play as The Destined One, whose mission is to collect the six relics left behind by Wukong. Yet, not everything is as straightforward.  In reality, our true mission is to become Sun Wukong, inheriting his legacy and title as the Monkey King. GameplayThe combat system is rich with variety, offering a mix of spells, stances, transformations, light and heavy combos, and combined chains of them as well. The game features over 100 bosses, which is an impressive number. Encounters are frequent, leaving little room for rest or boredom. The game is divided into six chapters, each completely distinct from the last.Sound & SoundtrackI highly recommend playing with the original Chinese voice acting. The work done by the voice actors is phenomenal and truly indescribable. The atmospheric music only elevates the experience, adding tension during boss fights and cutscenes.Pros and ConsPros:- Engaging combat with great variety.- A beautiful world filled with secrets to discover.- Deep, mysterious lore and fascinating characters.- Exceptional voice acting and music.- An impressive number and variety of bosses.- Adequate VRAM usage Cons:Honestly, I didn’t encounter any major cons while playing, but I can mention a minor issues: invisible walls, broken ""water"" quality settings and awful over sharpening that ruins the overall image quality and can not be disabled (without using UE console). Some areas look explorable, but upon getting closer, you find that you can't proceed.Black Myth: Wukong"" delivers an unforgettable experience, fully immersing you in your own ""Journey to the West"". It makes you feel as if you’re part of Chinese mythology, embarking on an epic adventure from The Destined One to the Monkey King.I would like to express my gratitude to developers for creating this masterpiece and I'm looking forward to a DLC and the future projects"
Positive,"Stunning graphics, enthralling enemies, fascinating characters, fun gameplay, great lore… holy shit is this a good game? This is a GOOD game."
Positive,Lacking in Inclusivity and Diversity just as expected. 10/10 GOTY
Positive,MONKEY... RECOMMEND 10\10
Positive,"Pros:Phenomenal soundtrackOutstanding atmosphereIncredible boss fightsGreat graphicsCombat versatile and fun (during bosses)Cons:Outdated camera movementOutdated character movementInvisible walls (for a 2024 game? Come on...)Bad enemy AlEmpty feeling world (still only a few hours in, might improve soon)Even with all the negatives tho, I'm still having a blast and love just looking at the game cuz it's gorgeous. What are your impressions so far? I figured some here may be able to educate me on the developers and their stylistic choices for this game."
Positive,"If I can only describe this game in a sentence, then Black Myth Wukong is ’a reflection of a labour of love and reverence paid to THE ORIGINAL Chinese mythology that is Journey to the West. Throughout most of the gameplay you can feel the reverence & details the devs put into this game.’ I absolutely recommend this game if you enjoyed Seikiro, Devil May Cry, Nioh series, GoW, Lords of the Fallen, Nier Automata series etc. This game builds on the legacies of others but also proudly stands out as the one of the most memorable ARPGs for me in recent years after 70+ hours.1) Black Myth Wukong is a very carefully composed, curated and guided linear/semi open world experience. You have options to explore untrodden paths but eventually all paths lead back to one. 2) It enhances your game experience to actually know some background context about the Chinese mythology that is ‘Journey to the West.’ Black Myth Wukong takes place AFTER the original events of Journey to the West with plenty of liberal interpretation & further new world building based on a version of the Monkey King. 3) The game is best when your mid way through but falls flat & rushed at the last chapter. There’s not many reviews that talk about polish of this game near the end but it’s bad. The assets/terrain look like placeholders, you can pass though solid objects like trees/NPCs… The feeling of rush to the finish is very distinct and is extremely jarring compared to chapters 1-5.4) This game rewards adaptive gameplay (freely respec skills & your gear), iteration (learning boss mechanics through failure) & exploration (methodical slow play). The game plot often interweaves through side quests & seemingly random encounters with lots of hidden information that requires reading text via in-game journal tab. The English translation is not good and overall story telling can be obfuscated and full of riddles adversely impacted by translation issues.5) You need to retain most in-game events in your memory  bank and connect fair amount of dots throughout your play through. Chapters whilst self contained has overarching connected side quests, world events, where even seemingly random picked up item hold important core narrative lore to add context. There’s also numerous NPC background stories that all contribute to different game outcomes & also help explain the overall story. E.g. a hidden zone in Chapter 2 with associated boss fight and story is directly tied to end event of Chapter 2 bringing a more fulfilling conclusion to Chapter 2 arc whilst also hinting at the constant time shift mechanic employed in this game’s story telling.6) There’s issues with how this game process player control input. There’s some issues with general input lag and how the game fails to register input due to animations locks out input even after animation seemingly completes. Best example is gourd use is mostly able to be triggered even between dodges or attacks. Medicines cannot. Taking medicine requires player to stand perfectly still with no player animation happening or other input.7) I also have this game on my PS5, my kid plays that mainly so as to not have my PC save file accidentally erased. PS5 version is definitely playable including PS Portal via remote play.Story/setting/visual: Very good story with Chinese voice over better than English (more nuance in the emotions conveyed - I keep English subtitles so I can keep up). To enjoy this game you need to have some cultural awareness, English/Chinese listening aptitude is essential (if you don’t want to rely on subtitles) yet bulk of the context to what plays out in this game is gathered through text as well. I give overall story 8/10 but YMMV especially if you don’t take time to fully comprehend the side stories including boss lore & tying it so together for yourself.Technical performance: I'm playing across range of PC hardware including at 1440p/4K with maxed out settings including ray tracing at Very High and everything on cinematic with DLSS at 75%. I average 80~120fps+ in-game with uncommon dips below 80fps with peaks around 125+fps. This is on a RTX4090M + 13900HX laptop as my desktop PC is currently out of action. I also play this on Legion Go (1200p) & tried on Asus Rog Ally (1080p)… Both played fine with FSR/XeSS at 40-50%, low-medium settings yielding 30~55fps in game without frame gen. On AMD hardware if you have anti-lag & AFMF toggled on via AMD Adrenaline software, it can cause severe stuttering issues in-game especially in Chapters 3 & 4. Chapter 3 is also less performant than all chapters with overall average fps dropping by 10-20% easily. There’s UE5 traversal stutters but this game at v1.0 launch is in a better technical state than most other UE5 games I’ve played. This game at launch is also playable & actually enjoyable (not something that can be taken for granted in modern AAA releases). Remember Game Science started with 7 devs in 2017, started really recruiting people after 2020, worked through COVID in China, never developed AAA level ARPG games and with barely any experience across the team has managed to deliver a product at v1.0 that is almost on par with the likes of GoW with a captivating world, better overall graphics & an original story setting.Game content, variety & depth: in my first 70+ hours I thoroughly enjoyed chapters 1-5. Chapter 6 is by far the worst and is actually subpar below AAA level due to lack of polish, glitches, enemy hitbox issues, low fidelity assets, boring level design (bland copy and paste to create false sense of scale - due to flying ability).As for lore; if you’re not reading at a minimum the character description scrolls after defeating each one, you’re losing out on critical lore & often interesting background. E.g. the 3 rat princes backstory if you read it (take you maybe 2-3 mins max) offers a great insight into why they act the at they do when you encounter them and made my experience more fulfilling after defeating them as more than just a boss rush.Controversy around this game : We seem to be trending towards more expensive game development but less value offered to customers with missing content, lack of variety/depth of content and even content locked behind day 1 DLCs. This includes games like Jedi Survivor, Starwars Outlaw & Space Marines 2 which shows how widely the industry has shifted in favour of monetisation above core game value. Often it’s more important how diverse a game appears with in-game NPCs rather than the diversity that matters like actual human beings that worked on the project, cultural representation etc. E,g. People should Google the English VAs that was paid and worked on Black Myth Wukong where they even had females play as male & deity type NPCs etc. The diversity of the VA cast and the dev team is overshadowed because of the ridiculous manufactured outrage over either mis-translations of embellished social media posts from years past or outright defamation by biased and inaccurate gaming ‘journalism,’ gobbled up by swaths of the public that are either misinformed or uninformed.Also those people that hate, review bomb or boycotting this game without even owning/trying this game because it’s Chinese developers is about as vile as it seems. There’s no justification for generalisation or bias confirmation. The devs have harmed no one in making and releasing this game. Buy this game if logic, real life diversity, cultural value, great gameplay & value for money appeals to you."

Positive,"Beat the game with multiple endings around 50hrs playtime,Excellent A-RPG game which borrowed heavily elements from Soulsborne but few points could be improved:+Amazing combat gameplay, skills unlockable with skill tree equivalent Sekiro game, with Spells, transformation, vessel, and spirits as you progress on early chapter.+Divided by chapter but you could backtrack the previous it even on next chapter+OSTs are amazing, Orchestrated wukong tv series version for this game+Moderate length cutscenes on bossfight is an eyecandy, which is something rare for A-RPG genre nowaday+Lore for each Characters written on details on Journal, prepare for TL;DR unless you're speedreader+Amazing storyline (I wished they had more chapter, felt too short for me 40-50hrs)-Boss rushes, prepare to fight 3-5 bosses within Hour (a bit excessive subjectively statement)-No Map to refer to (depends on your exploration memories), also few item missables throughout gameplay-Exploration and navigate terrain often blocked by invisible wall if you approached most of edge almost superficial exploration, even worse when enemies knocked you into below level and you had to back up (Invisible wall but enemies can pushed you, weird)-Missable item put out of reach unless using weird combo jump skill.-Minor clipping texture on empty part of map, also lighting glitch when transitioning between dark and outside cave when navigateCombat gameplay and Storyline are excellent, superb graphic with unreal engine but require latest rig in order to use Raytracing, but exploration a bit drawback and less fun if not handholding with invisible wall."

Positive,"I have never seen a game with such beautiful graphics. On top of that, the animations at the end of each chapter, the exquisite music, the rich combat system, and the intriguing plot all highlight the exquisiteness of this game."
Positive,"For me, game has a TON going for it. Reminds me of Sekiro and Ghost of Tsushima but with a Lords of the Fallen/Elden Ring twist. Best part? It's hard, but not souls-like hard. You have to focus on the bosses, but it feels great. It's gorgeous, plays smooth, and the skill tree is awesome. Just enough RPG to satisfy the itch, yet enough ""souls"" to make me invest. Love the Fable-esque vibes of monkeys/wolves/etc. pertaining to the setting/lore.Very much impressed of overall quality and depth. Definitely a GOTY runner up. We'll see how it holds up as I crunch in the time soaking up what it has to offer <3"
Positive,"Played this on my friend's PC for a bit and i was in love with it right then and there! That and seeing all the positive reviews made buying it a no-brainer! Eveytime i booted the game i was glued to the screen and wanted to play as long as i could cause it's just that damn good. The sound design. beautiful environment and fluid combat are some of the great things, i could go on and on about all the amazing things but that would take a very long time, haha! Finished the game and i'm already itching to jump back in! Truly deserves the GOTY award!EDIT: My friend who played this through family share also approves of this game! Steam wouldn't let him post him a review but his voice will be heard, So 2 thumbs up!"
Positive,"Hace años vengo vagando por un desierto sin fin, luego de tanto tiempo es la primera vez que veo un oasis y eh de decir que con 3 hs en el oasis no me quiero ir. No solo a niveles graficos el juego es supremos, sino que su contenido tanto grafico como de lore es una lokura. Y ni hablemos del sistema de combate, esta mas pulido que la salchicha de Alberto. F. 10/10 RECOMENDADOMi amigo me dijo que si escribia esta review y llegaba a 30 me gusta homero me daba un chervesa"
Positive,Amazing Game with good combat and Visuals. Story i still have no idea what's going on. Performance issues are there especially in chapter 2. Hopefully they fix it with future patches. 10/10 for me
Positive,haven't even gotten that far in and im not good at dark souls style games but this game is so much fun and it looks amazing!!!!(i got this free with my graphics card for my new pc)
Positive,"9 / 10Using Vietsub from HGACPlayable on SteamDeckStory, music, graphic, gameplay,... is far more than what I expected. The only downside is map design is just so bad, I dont know where am I or where I need to go in most map."
Positive,"Amazing game after a long time! Visually one of the best games of 2024, just finished chapter 1 and had very smooth experience, did face some minor stutters but nothing game breaking! The combat system feels great and no it isnt souls-like at all. There is heavy emphasis on dodge mechanism here and there is no parry system so it feels much more like playing a hybrid of bayonetta/Nier and monster hunter, the only thing in common here with souls like games is the inability to choose difficulty and the existence of stamina bar, the thing that souls like games excel is in the level design with interconnecting shortcuts and areas but this game has very linear levels and has chapter progression similar to that of new God of war game. If you are looking for a new fast paced souls like game then this isnt one, better play Sekiro instead which is no doubt one of the best games ever made.The things I liked in this game ->Amazing graphics>Fluid Combat Systems>Character Design>StoryThe things I disliked - > Level Design> Lack of maps, even a simple one would've made the game way betterBlackMyth: Wukong reminded me DOTA 2 a lot since the combat has lots of BOUNDLESS STRIKES and even one of the stances reminds me of primal spring. Building focus also feels similar to building Jingu stacks so kudos to Valve for making a really great hero!"
Positive,Black Myth Wukong จากตัวละครในสุดยอดวรรณกรรมจีนอันโด่งดังสู่เกม Action แนว Hack & Slash เดินหน้าฟันดะแต่ความยากเทียบเท่าระดับน้อง ๆ Sekiro ด้วยคอนเซ็ปต์อาร์ตดาร์ค ๆ มืดหม่น และการดีไซน์ตัวศัตรูให้ดูน่ากลัวหลอน ๆ และท่วงท่าการโจมตีที่กะจังหวะหลบได้ยาก กลิ่นอายของ Soulslike ยังอยู่ในเกมนี้อย่างครบถ้วน หากจะเข้าไปฟันกันโต้ง ๆ คงได้กลับไปเกิดจุดเซฟรัว ๆ อย่างแน่นอน ดีกรีความยากต้องขอบอกว่าเล่นจนหัวร้อนถึงขั้นเปิดแอร์เบอร์ 25แล้วเอาพัดลมเป่าตัว เหงื่อถึงจะหยุดไหลกันเลยทีเดียว(เรื่องจริงนะ) และเกมนี้มีความยากระดับเดียวไม่มีตัวเลือกให้ปรับแต่งแต่อย่างใดอีกต่างหากซุนหงอคงคือตัวละครหลักที่เราจะได้เล่น มากับฉากเปิดตัวเต็มไปด้วยความตระการตา ทั้งฉากต่อสู้และเสียงเพลงประกอบ พลันให้ขนบนตัวลุกซู่ขึ้นมา พร้อมกับ Tutorial เล็ก ๆ น้อย ๆ ก่อนที่จะให้เราได้เริ่มเกมจริง ๆ โดยคอนเทนท์เกมในส่วนต่าง ๆ จะปลดล็อกออกไปตามเนื้อเรื่องทีละนิด ๆ เช่น การสร้างอาวุธ ชุดเกราะ การอัพสกิลทักษะ ยา หรือกระทั่งวิญญาณที่เรียกออกมาให้ช่วยสู้ด้านกราฟฟิคเนื่องจากผู้เขียนได้เกมฟรีจากการซื้อการ์ดจอของค่ายเขียวยี่ห้อ Galax 4070 แบบธรรมดา 12Gb ตัวเกมปรับกราฟฟิคเป็นสูงสุดมาให้อัตโนมัติตั้งแต่เข้าเกมมาและด้วยขุมพลังของ CPU Intel I7 10700 สามารถทำเฟรมเรทได้ที่ 55+ ไม่ต่ำไปกว่านี้ถือว่าค่อนข้างโอเค และรองรับ DLSS เต็มรูปแบบ การประมวลผลภาพที่ได้มาคือ “ขนลิงมันเป็นขนลิงเลยอะ” ขนเป็นขน เนียนกริ๊บ แสงเงา เท็กส์เจอร์ก้อนหิน ใบไม้ หรือเงาต่าง ๆ ถือว่าทำออกมาได้ดีมาก ส่วนปัญหาเรื่องกราฟฟิคมีเพียงช่วงเปลี่ยนฉากทิศทางแสงจะเปลี่ยนอย่างเห็นได้ชัดเจน อย่างเช่นอยู่ในถ้ำเราจะเห็นแดดนอกถ้ำทะแยงแสงมาจากฝั่งขวา แต่พอออกจากถ้ำแล้วมีการโหลดฉาก แสงก็เปลี่ยนทิศทางไปเป็นฝั่งซ้ายเฉยเลย...ก็มีบ้างเนื้อเรื่องตัวเกมทำออกมาได้เรียบง่าย เส้นทางค่อนข้างเป็นทางตรง มีทางแยกบ้าง แต่สุดท้ายก็จะไปบรรจบที่เดียวกัน ถึงจะดูเหมือนเส้นตรงก็จริงแต่ด้วยความที่เกมไม่ได้มอบมินิแมพหรือแผนที่มาให้เลย อาจทำให้มีหลงเส้นทางอยู่บ้างในช่วงเริ่มแรก แต่ก็มีคุณค่ามากพอแก่การเดินหลงสำรวจให้ครบถ้วน เพราะจะมีไอเทมหรือบอสลับอยู่มากมายรอคอยการเจอของคุณอยู่ เมื่อค้นพบหรือเอาชนะมันลงได้ อาจได้รับไอเทมที่ใช้ในการอัพเกรดของต่าง ๆ และสามารถนำไปอัพเกรดได้ที่ศาลเจ้าที่เปรียบเสมือนจุด Checkpoint และจุดเกิดซึ่งเรียงรายอยู่ตามทางได้ศัตรูเกมนี้จะมีออกมาตามทางให้เป็นระยะ ๆ ไม่ล้นเกร่อแบบเกมออนไลน์ทั่วไป อย่างจำพวกกี้ ๆ จะมาพอให้กรุ้มกริ่มเป็นการวอร์มอัพข้อมือข้อนิ้วก่อนจะไปเจอมินิบอสที่เรียงรายตามทางทุก ๆ 10-15นาที ฝีมือบางตัวร้ายการพอฟัดพอเหวี่ยง บางตัวปรากฏตัวอย่างอลังการขู่ขวัญเราด้วยขนาดตัวและกล้ามล่ำ ๆ แต่หากเราจับทริคมันได้จะง่ายขึ้นมาก บางตัวแทบไม่จำเป็นต้องใช้ยาเลย แต่แลกกับการตายซ้ำซากอยู่นานโขและอาจซื้อจอยอันใหม่มาแทนที่ หรืออย่างร้ายสุดคือตายจนจำบทพูดเย้ยหยันของบอสจนเอาไปพูดตามได้เลย (ฮา)ศัตรูแต่ละตัวหากเราฆ่าได้เป็นตัวแรกจะปลดล็อกเนื้อหาของมัน สามารถเข้าถึงเรื่องราวเกี่ยวกับศัตรูตัวนั้น และเมื่อพิชิตบอสประจำฉากได้จะมีอนิเมชั่นให้เราได้ดูเนื้อเรื่อง อีกทั้งสามารถดูแผนผังและคำบรรยายของภาพนั้นหลังจากจบฉากนั้นได้อีกด้วยการต่อสู้ในเกมนี้ทำได้ค่อนข้างสนุก กระชับ ชัดเจน ใช้โจมตีเบาเพื่อสะสมเกจพลังเพื่อโจมตีหนักใช้เป็นคอมโบต่อเนื่องหรือจะชาร์จเพื่อโจมตีหนักทีเดียวแบบหนักหน่วงก็ได้ตามสไตล์ของเรา ท่วงท่าการโจมตีมีให้ถึงสามแบบด้วยกัน ซึ่งแต่ละสกิลมีให้อัพแยกย่อยลงมาอีกมากมาย อีกทั้งทักษะแขนงอื่นอย่างทักษะติดตัว เพิ่มเลือด เพิ่มมานา หรือสเตมิน่า มาคอยให้เราเก็บเวลได้ติดงอมแงมแบบกู่ไม่กลับแน่นอน แต่ถ้าถามว่ามีข้อเสียไหมในระบบการต่อสู้เกมนี้ ต้องขอตอบว่ามี และเป็นข้อเสียขนาดใหญ่เสียด้วย(เป็นความคิดเห็นส่วนตัว) นั่นคือมุมกล้องที่ออกแบบมาได้แคบมาก และไม่มีตัวเลือกให้ปรับให้มุมมองกว้างขึ้นมาได้ อีกทั้งหากสู้ในที่แคบ ๆ มุมกล้องเราจะไม่ทะลุกำแพง นั่นหมายความว่ามุมมองเราจะถูกบีบให้ใกล้ตัวละครจนเห็นแต่หลังตัวละคร หรือบางครั้งการล็อกเป้าหมายโจมตีศัตรูที่ตัวเตี้ยกว่า มุมกล้องเราจะถูกกดให้ต่ำลง ส่งผลให้มองเห็นแค่พื้นในมุมมองที่แคบ หากเราถูกรุม เป็นเรื่องยากมากที่จะไม่เสียเลือดเสียเนื้อ นอกจากคนเล่นจะเป็นนิวไทป์น่ะนะ... และอีกข้อหนึ่งที่สำคัญ หากเราต้องการชาร์จโจมตีหนักที่ต้องกด Y (XBOX) หรือ ปุ่มสามเหลี่ยม(PS) โดยใช้นิ้วหัวแม่มือขวา จะทำให้เราเปลี่ยนมุมกล้องด้วยแกน แอนนาล็อกด้านไม่ได้หรือไม่ถนัดเลย ทำให้การชาร์จโจมตีหนักนั้น ก้านคอของตัวละครจะกลายเป็นอัมพาตทันทีเนื่องจากหันมุมกล้องแทบเป็นไปไม่ได้หรือได้แต่ยากมาก ๆ ซึ่งอาจต้องอาศัยนิ้วชี้ที่ไม่ถนัดเลยในการกดแทนที่พลาดไม่ได้คือระบบ Spell ที่บริโภคค่ามานาไว้คอยขัดจังหวะการโจมตีของศัตรูได้อย่างเห็นผลชะงักและพลิกให้ไพ่ของเราอยู่เหนือกว่าพวกมันได้เพียงอึดใจ ในตอนแรก Spell จะมีผลออกมาได้ไม่ค่อยดีนัก ซึ่งเราต้องอัพสกิลเพื่อให้มีประสิทธิภาพประสิทธิผลที่ดียิ่งขึ้น แต่ต้องแลกกับการไม่ได้อัพสกิลสายต่อสู้ แต่เกมค่อนข้างอิสระในการอัพพอสมควรเพื่อให้เข้ากับสไตล์การต่อสู้ของเราเอง แต่ใช่ว่ามาถึงจะอัพค่ามานา 5เลเวลแรกเลยนะ เดี๋ยวช่วงแรกจะไม่มีท่าคอมโบใช้สู้ใด ๆ เลยเด้อต่อมาก็เป็นระบบเครื่องสวมใส่ เกมนี้จะไม่ได้เป็นการสุ่มดรอปอย่างเกม Soulslike ทั่ว ๆ ไป แต่จะเป็นการคราฟท์แบบตายตัวเมื่อคุณพิชิตบอสได้สำเร็จ อาวุธและชุดเกราะใหม่ถึงจะถูกปลดล็อกมาให้คราฟท์ได้ ไอเทมคราฟท์หาได้ตามหีบในฉากที่ซ่อนอยู่ หรือบ้างก็ดรอปจากมอนสเตอร์หรือว่าพวกมินิบอสกับบอส ส่วน Will(ค่าเงินในเกม) จะได้จากการดูดวิญญาณสีเขียวเข้าน้ำเต้าจากการสังหารศัตรู (แอบเหมือนเกม Onimusha เหมือนกันแฮะ) โดยค่า Will จะใช้ในการซื้อไอเทมหรือใช่เป็นค่าอัพเกรดอาวุธชุดเกราะหรือวิญญาณที่ช่วยเราต่อสู้ได้อีกด้วย และด้วยวิธีการอัพเกรดที่ล็อกตายตัวของเกมนี้ ทำให้เราไม่ได้รู้สึกเก่งขึ้นเมื่อเจอบอสที่เก่งขึ้นตัวถัดไป เพียงแค่ไม่ได้ทำให้เรากระจอกลงเท่านั้นเอง ครั้นจะเก็บเลเวลให้สูง ๆ ไปสู้กับมันก็ใช้เวลานาน เพราะศัตรูอยู่กระจายไม่กระจุกซึ่งเสียเวลาโดยใช่เหตุ สรุปได้ว่าอย่างไรเสียเกมนี้ก็ต้องพึ่งฝีมือถึง 50%เลยทีเดียว 30% เป็นทักษะที่เราอัพ 10%เป็นไอเทมสวมใส่ และอีก10% ค่าน้ำเต้าเพิ่มพลังน้ำเต้าเพิ่มพลังเกมนี้มีลูกเล่นอยู่บ้างเล็กน้อย โดยเราสามารถเลือกรูปแบบน้ำเต้าให้มีออพชั่นเสริม หลังจากนั้นก็มีให้เลือกรูปแบบน้ำยาได้อีกว่าต้องการให้มีผลการฟื้นฟูเลือดอย่างไร สุดท้ายคล้าย ๆ กับเพิ่มลูกกลอนในตัวน้ำยาไว้เพิ่มบัฟหลังจากที่ดื่มน้ำเต้าไป การจะอัพเกรดได้จำเป็นต้องใช้ไอเทมเฉพาะมาอัพ มันจะเป็นผลเหลือง ๆ ของต้นไม้ที่มีศัตรูโหด ๆ เฝ้าแทบทุกต้นเลย เป็นการบอกกลาย ๆ ว่าถ้าอยากเก่งขึ้นคุณต้องเก่งกว่ามันให้ได้เสียก่อน นอกจากน้ำเต้าจะช่วยดูดวิญญาณศัตรูในเกมแล้ว ยังดูดวิญญาณเราให้คอยหาค่า Will มาอัพพวกนี้อีกด้วยสิเนี่ย(ให้ตายสิ)Spirit หรือวิญญาณจากศัตรูที่ได้จากการสังหารนั้น เราสามารถสวมใส่เพื่อเรียกใช้เป็นสกิลมาโจมตีศัตรูได้ เราจะได้ Spirit จากศัตรูพิเศษโดยสังเกตได้จากศัตรูที่ติดไฟสีฟ้ารอบตัวและจะเก่งกาจกว่าปกติเล็กน้อย แต่ละแบบจะมีเพียงตัวเดียวเท่านั้น ฉะนั้นเดินหาให้ทั่ว ๆ จะเป็นการดีที่สุด แต่หากคุณพลาด สามารถเดินทางกลับได้ตลอดเวลาด้วยศาลเจ้า และ Relic ที่ได้รับหลังจากชนะบอสประจำฉากจะสามารถเลือกความสามารถติดตัวได้ 1ข้อ จาก 1ใน3ข้อเสียของเกมคงไม่เหมาะสำหรับผู้เล่นที่ได้อัพสกิลแล้วรู้สึกว่าต้องสู้ได้ง่ายขึ้น สำหรับเกมนี้คืออัพสกิลแล้วสู้ไม่ง่ายขึ้น แต่สู้ได้ลื่นไหลขึ้น จังหวะต่อเนื่องมากขึ้นเท่านั้น ส่วนการอัพอาวุธและชุดเกราะไม่ค่อยหลากหลายสักเท่าไหร่ และออพชั่นเซ็ทบางชุดไม่ค่อยเห็นผลอย่างมีนัยยะสำคัญมากนัก และด้วยข้อนี้อาจจะไม่ค่อยมีแรงจูงใจในการให้เรารู้สึกอยากฟาร์มหาอาวุธหรือไอเทมอัพเกรดที่ทำให้รู้สึกสู้ได้ง่ายขึ้นเลย แต่ข้อด้อยนี้ก็ได้ถูกกลบลงไปด้วยเนื้อเรื่องที่น่าติดตามและสกิลที่ให้อัพค่อนข้างหลากหลาย หากไม่ซีเรียสเรื่องบัคแสงเงาบางฉาก และถ้าอยากฝึกแนว Sekiro เพื่อเพิ่มความนิ่งทางสภาวะจิตใจให้แนวแน่กับการลงแรงนิ้วกดปุ่มจอยเพื่อหลบหลีกอย่างสมบูรณ์แบบให้ดีขึ้น แต่ขณะเดียวกันก็ไม่อยากเสียค่า EPX เวลาตายแบบเกม Soulslike อื่น ๆ อย่าง Darksoul ต้องมานั่งวิ่งไล่เก็บศพอีก ก็ขอให้เกมนี้เป็นตัวเลือกแรก ๆ ในอ้อมกอดไว้ใน Steam เลย หรืออย่างน้อยเอาไปดองเกลือใน ID ไปก่อนก็ยังถือว่ากำไรชีวิตขอรับคะแนนความพึงพอใจส่วนตัวคือ 8/10 และเหตุผลที่หักคะแนนไป 2คะแนนได้แก่1. 0.5 มุมกล้องทำออกมาได้แคบ2. 0.5 ความหลากหลายของอาวุธชุดเกราะ3. 0.5 Spirit ที่เอาจริง ๆ ไม่ค่อยได้ใช้ประโยชน์4. 0.5 กำแพงอากาศเยอะเกินไปปล.ตัวเกมมีออพชั่นปรับเปลี่ยนไอคอนจอยให้ด้วย ระหว่าง XBOX และ PS ใครคุ้นชินอันไหนก็ปรับกันได้ตามสะดวกเลย ชอบตรงนี้มาก

It absolutely deserves all the praise it is getting.Combat feels incredibe, enemies are not as punishing and overtuned as in Elden Ring and other Dark souls games, the itemization and skill tree is excellent, and one of the best features is that you can respecialize your skills at any time for no cost.Absolutely phenomenal game, one of the best purchases I've made in years."

Positive,"Buckle up, fellow adventurer, because I’m about to take you on a mythical journey through the extraordinary realms of Black Myth: Wukong. 🌟🐒🔥The Legend Unfolds: From the moment I stepped into this ancient world, I felt the pulse of its magic. The mist-clad forests whispered secrets, and the pagodas stood like silent sentinels, guarding forgotten knowledge. Wukong, our rebellious hero, radiated charisma. His staff crackled with energy, and his eyes held the weight of centuries.Combat as Poetry: Picture this: Wukong, surrounded by foes, his staff an extension of his will. Each swing, a brushstroke on the canvas of chaos. The combat system dances between elegance and brutality. I pirouetted through enemy formations, deflecting arrows, and delivering spinning kicks that sent demons sprawling. Boss battles? They’re symphonies of strategy and spectacle. I faced a serpent with scales like jade, a thunder deity crackling with lightning, and a shape-shifting fox spirit. Each encounter left me breathless, heart pounding.A Canvas of Dreams: The visuals—oh, the visuals! The artists dipped their brushes in starlight and painted landscapes that defy reality. Cherry blossoms swirled in the wind, and ancient temples clung to cliffs like stubborn memories. When Wukong ascended a mountain peak, the world unfolded below—a tapestry of wonder. And those animated vignettes at the end of each chapter? Pure magic. They revealed the antagonist’s tragic past, leaving me haunted and hungry for more.Threads of Fate: The story weaves threads from the classic Journey to the West. It’s like sipping tea with Sun Wukong himself, listening to tales of gods and demons. Sure, some references might elude newcomers, but they’re breadcrumbs leading to deeper mysteries. I reveled in the lore, piecing together prophecies and ancient scrolls.The Glitches and Grins: Okay, let’s address the quirks. Occasionally, the game hiccupped like a startled dragon. Crashes? Yep. Characters switching languages mid-sentence? Confusing, but oddly endearing. And the gear system? Well, it’s like Wukong got caught in a cosmic thrift store. Upgrading his staff felt like polishing a relic—I yearned for more impactful choices.Verdict: Black Myth: Wukong isn’t just a game; it’s an odyssey. Flaws? Sure, but they’re like cracks in a porcelain vase—part of its charm. So, grab your staff, channel your inner monkey king, and step into a world where myths breathe and legends clash. You won’t regret it. 🌿🔮✨"

Positive,game of the year 2024
Positive,"my first souls-like on first console wasnt so friendly with the buttons, took over 30 mins for the first boss..i think im not bad, its gotta be dogphobia 🎀 but i enjoyed it so far. if it gets harder, ill just cry and play"
Positive,Can't believe this game is in the top of the Steam Stats for Most Played game. It even surpassed Counter-Strike 2 by 2x. Black Myth: Wukong just made history
Positive,No diversity +10
Positive,"Story, gameplay, music, graphics... just awesome! Didin't expect to see such a good game these days anymore. My first soulslike and I love it. Truly a masterpiece!"
Positive,"Developers had an advantage of taking a very well developed world and one of the most famous story in it. And they not only took it but they delivered on it. Game has wide variety of enemies each of them has it's own backstory (obviously taken from chinese folklore but still) which slightly enlarge our understanding of the world. And just this world and story is enough to give this game a try even if you are not a fan of any other aspects of the game.Game consists of 6 chapters each of which has it's unique enemy cast (with exception of ch5) and corresponding bosses. I remember entering ch5 and my thought ""lol those enemies are just reskins of earlier ones lazy devs"". But in any other game I would just perceive this as a norm and the fact that I perceived this as a minus speaks very highly about enemy variety in the game.Bosses divides in two parts - chiefs and kings. Difficulty-wise they are mixed up, kings just have more shiny moves I guess...Bosses in a vacuum are all awesome - they has their place in the world, they has a backstory, they have cool moves and good loot. Also they are balanced pretty good for an adventure game even tho I wish they was harder cos amount of bosses I just first try facetanked is unhealthy in my opinion. On the other hand I heard that some people struggles a lot on different bosses so my opinion is not objective here. And yes, I also struggled on those two bosses :)Maps are also awesome - with unique biomes and gorgeous views. They are normal adventure type maps with branching path to the end boss. But game doesn't have any map in menu so navigating and finding all secrets can be quite time consuming (especially in ch3).Chapter 6 map is failed (in my opinion) experiment on openworld type of map. There is literally nothing in it except for a few bad bosses and 1 (one!) chest.Why ch6 bosses are bad? I hate 2 types of bosses: ""puzzle"" boss and ""catch me bitch"" boss. They are like 90% of ch6 bosses :(But game is not without technical problems of courseFirst of all - camera. Camera can get behind a tree or a wall which is annoying. Also camera tracking is quite loose so if you move around around the boss too much or if boss is has very mobile moveset - he will be out of your field view for a good 30+% of a fight. Also you can just lose target lock during some of boss moves if you don't manually readjust camera during fight (which is annoying if you use gamepad).Minor problem with inputs - for example run button won't register if you pressed it before your run-prohibiting move ends.And annoying problem with lack of target tracking. Like you know how lazy boss designers adds insane target tracking to all moves of bosses - here designers went deeper - heavy attack after roll in 75% of cases will just miss the mark completely - it's not hitting where enemy was, nor where he is going, just some random particle in the air, which is extremely frustrating after you spent like a minute to charge this attack.But despite these problems game is still awesome, bosses are still very manageable due to variety of builds (and ability to redo your build at any time).Solid"
Positive,Boss fights in  Black Myth: Wukong  >>> boss fights in any other game.Boss fights on Mount Mei >>> any other boss fights in  Black Myth: Wukong.
Positive,"Feels like playing Actual Kung Fu Panda, specially these bosses. Game is good, i got decent fps on RTX 4080 Super. Unplayable in 4k barely get 30 fps."
Positive,"I sold my MK arcana in Dota to get this game, 100% worth it. Monkey King arcana for Monkey King game."
Positive,The first game I bought with out discount
Positive,APES TOGETHER STRONK
Positive,Game Action Yang Epic Banget+ Combat yang fluid+ Variasi Skill yang banyak+ Grafik nya ulala+ Variasi Bos yang banyak- Kasih Map lah buat chapter 3 woyy nyasarrrr guaaa
Positive,Well crafted game that does an excellent job paying homage to the classic story of Wukong.
Positive,"it has its own Tower of Latria level with with infected monkeybrains, geniusfun game but kinda completely falls apart and stops being fun in the final chapter but still a fun romp up until then"
Positive,monkey oo oo ahh ahh good game would recommend
Positive,"Isn't that what we've come to expect from major companies? A small team presenting their first AAA game has shown just how poorly these big companies handle their major releases. Amazing gameplayStunning graphicsNo technical issues at launch (they released a benchmark pre-release, instead of making us wait weeks or months for fixes!!)No microtransactions (this isn't a free mobile game; it's a game we paid full price for)Well done Game ScienceOne last thing...  I bet IGN is crying in the corner right now."
Positive,"9/10 this Chinese God of War is GOTY material. The only thing mediocre is map design.Update: After completing NG, I think the game has more problems such as weird hitbox for some bosses and low poise. Maybe IGN's 8/10 was right if you deduct points for every bad design choice in game, but considering how most triple A games in this era are overrated crap I would still rate this game 8.5/10 to 9/10."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong marks a monumental leap for Chinese game development, heralding its entry into the echelon of triple-A gaming—and it does so with a resounding bang. This isn't just any game; it's a masterful adaptation of one of China's most beloved tales, the timeless ""Journey to the West,"" a novel that has captivated hearts since 1592 and stands proudly among the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature.What sets this game apart is its deep roots in a narrative so rich and enduring that every NPC you encounter doesn't just exist for the sake of the game; they are drawn straight out of literary history, each with a backstory echoing through centuries. The attention to detail is staggering—from the lush environments to the dynamic cloud systems in the sky, which react impressively to your movements during combat, adding an immersive layer of interaction that is rarely seen in video games.I urge you not just to play the game but to opt for the deluxe edition. This version includes a soundtrack that is nothing short of a cultural treasure trove, featuring reimagined versions of musical pieces that have been woven into the very fabric of Chinese heritage. Black Myth: Wukong is not merely a game; it's an experience—a bridge between ancient folklore and modern entertainment—and it's an experience that no gamer should miss out on.For 32:9 display we can use this patch: https://github.com/Lyall/UltrawidePatches/tree/main/Black%20Myth%20Wukong"
Positive,"Dont let the people saying ""Chinese Bots spamming Reviews"" discourage you from giving this game a try. If 96% of 200,000 reviews isnt enough to get you to try the game a few more things to look forward to are as follows-Combat-Deceptively simple at first, seeming like a crap ton of light attack spam until you start to look into the different skill trees. Truly one of the most densely packed combat systems I have ever seen. While Im sure you might be able to play the entire game light attack spamming and spam rolling there is a giant amount of room for you to express some skill. With about 76 (a random large number) different parry systems and combos you will quickly realize that there is PLENTY of different ways to take on this game.Environment/Looks-I truly dont understand how people can say the game doesnt look gorgeous, not to mention the level design in general is amazing. Its not just ""dressed up straight lines"" as another person declared its truly dynamic and beautiful. Each chapter of the game showing off something completely different its impossible to get bored of the look, not to mention stopping several times to just admire the game.Performance-Now obviously with such a gorgeous game on UE5 its going to be difficult to run thats sort of a given. That being said its no where near impossible a specific review I saw claimed they were on a 4080 SUPER and could hardly run it. Well with my drivers all up to date and everything properly taken care of, on the MAX settings with ray tracing AND an ultrawide (3440;1440) I ran the game above 100 fps almost ALWAYS and rarely could tell if upscaling was needing to do anything at all. Ive heard bad things about AMD obviously I cant speak on that, but a friend of mine owns a 1660 SUPER and was still capable of playing the benchmark (which has been completely accurate for me in testing) at 70 fps on medium ray tracing off.Story-Again something that is admittedly subjective, and I LOVE the chinese mythos as well as the story of wukong in general. The way they present every fight, the cinematics at the end of each chapter, and how they bring it all together is just beyond words. Not to mention the sheer amount of extra lore you can read or find in alternate areas is something that I just cannot describe as anything other than amazing. Now obviously the lip syncing does not match at all with the English dub, from what I can tell and have been told the game was dubbed in Mandarin, so I mean yeah obviously it wont be the same, but the voice acting itself is top notch.Price-Sixty dollars is obviously a lot of money but hey at least its not seventy like most games these days, I think its absolutely worth the price I wont miss a single dollar. But waiting for a sale if you cannot afford it is never a bad thing.Monke-MonkeSoulsLike-The developers have been stressing to every reviewer and everybody in general that this is not meant to be a souls-like. There are some obvious similarities with the checkpoint system and the roll focused combat and the challenging bosses. But I would agree that if I had to draw a similarity, its more closely related to God of War or something of that nature. Rarely does it feel like im playing a souls-like. Conclusion-The game is AMAZING, and my general rule for this kind of thing is to NOT listen to reviewers hell, I have never reviewed a game before I just loved this game so much. But for the love of god if the reviewer has less than 2 hours played and the product is refunded and they claim to know all about the story being boring and the combat being awful the level design being trash without even PLAYING 5% OF THE GAME. Just play it for yourself, and you can form your own opinion."

Positive,"I was literally crying while I was playing the game. As a person who loves the traditional Chinese culture and mythology, Wukong has always been my hero. Now when I see my hero returns with a high-quality and smooth piece of art, what else can I say? 10/10."
Positive,"One of the best games I've played in a very long while. The graphics are gorgeous, story is amazing, combat is fluid, gives you lots of options. I don't usually repeat games, but I've played this one twice, and have almost gotten the platinum trophy on it. I paid full price for the deluxe edition of this game, and so far it is worth every bit I have paid for it. Only downsides may be lack of replayability, and build variety, by second playthrough there are two, maximum three builds that wreck everything, anything else you use is just for fun. The game is really nice sure, but the second time over, the charm isn't the same anymore. The boss fights are so well made however that I couldn't pass a single one, not even the optional ones because of how much fun it is."
Positive,Remember - No sweet baby.
Positive,So much love & effort was put into this game. 9.5 GOTY.
Positive,"This is my childhood brought to life. Thank you Game Science. Once again, the Great Sage Equal Of Heaven has opened up a new path for Chinese culture."
Positive,"WARNING !!!!this game is : ""Lack of inclusivity, diversity and representation""11/10Take my money !!!"
Positive,"Another AAA game that isn't plagued with bugs or over-hyped in this decade. Kudos on your hard work game science! initially I thought that bmw's story would be about the story of the journey to the west. But instead it happens after the end of the journey to the west, after tang sanzang and his disciples receive the scriptures. Where after a dispute between him and the celestial court,The original wukong is sealed with his relics scattered everywhere and you, as the destined one (another monkey) have to set out on a journey to retrieve them In hopes of regaining his memories and reviving him. A lot of bosses in the game are also key antagonists and characters in the journey to the west, with a lot of dialogues also referencing the story, which can be confusing for people who does not know the lore of journey to the west. Which I recommend you guys check it out. The combat in this game feels very engaging, with 2 different weapon styles and 3 different stances all with different move sets and attacks makes the game very fresh so you can try out all styles and combine them to your advantage. The bosses can be a bit challenging which takes you a few tries to defeat them. But a good thing about this game is that you can always go somewhere else to level up and farm before coming back to fight, there is also no penalty for dying (unlike souls games) so you don't have to worry about it.The game also looks very good and detailed, with every chapter's map very well made and is also very pretty to look at.Mainly in this game you can craft different weapons and armour sets. They all have a unique passive which can significantly change the playstyle, making this game very unique as you can try a lot of different builds and tackle yaoguais a different way. The main story took around 65 hours for me to beat with all sidequests and bosses. However this really depends on if you want to just get through story or do sidequests and fight every optional boss. It also really depends on how good you are versus bosses and how much you die. For me this is one of my first action games I played and I got stuck in some bosses for hours. If you are looking for 100% completion, be prepared to pour around 100+ hours as you will need at least 2 or 3 playthroughs to achieve that and get all steam achievements. However it is also still fun beating up random bosses after you finish the game in ng+.This game has quickly become one of my favourite games of all time, and is also one of the few games which I bought full price during release that I do not regret buying. I highly recommend this to everyone that loves action/soulslike games.Ps: the DLC in my opinion is skippable, it only gives you some armor and a staff which only helps you for like 2 bosses and it get replaced by better gear."
Positive,"Before I decided to get the game, which I didn't buy it myself. A steam friend gave me this game as gift out of the blue, thanks to him much appreciated.  To be frank, I was expecting this game to be your regular souls like with a Chinese theme and ok combat. Well, I was wrong. I was blown away by the game.For one, the introduction story and chapter cut scenes were all topnotch, as if the developers hired all the participants from short stories award winners to make them. Music gives me goose bumps, never had I listen to a sound track so culturally Chinese and yet so grand and epic. As an ethnic Chinese, I never played a game that is so authentically Chinese, whether it is the aesthetics, music. buildings and clothing of the characters. You really cannot compare games with the art designs for Wo Long with Wukong. Though both uses Chinese culture as their setting the game. Wo Long just looks a little too foreign/off to a Chinese to me. (Like Ninja turtles to Japanese) While the level design of the game is not too different from your regular linear ARPG. The combat is just too good. Despite using mainly a staff for the MC weapon, there are three stances the player can switch from. Each stance has their strength and weakness depending on the enemy you are fighting. It is encouraged to switch stance against different bosses, it will make the fight better. Then there are spells and Spirits aka yao guai to help customize your build based on your fighting style. Combat is great! But do take notes, while some bosses may be too easy to a souls veteran, there are many others, especially hidden secret bosses that will give souls like veteran a run for their money. Map for each chapter is surprisingly huge. Given Chapter one is shorter. Everything because really huge starting from Chapter two.This is a really great game. If this game doesn't get a game award. the game award is rigged for sure."
Positive,If this game doesn't win GOTY 2024 i am going to beat up a child

Positive,"fantastic game, so beautiful and awesome. I love China! Bing Chillin"
Positive,"""Mmm...monkey...""- Master Oogway"
Positive,return to monke
Positive,dude this story is so cool only wish china was real
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong is very awesome game. Its great in terms of bosses, secret areas and quests and world design. But don't consider it a soulslike. Its more of an action RPG like God of War with just taking some elements from souls games. All in all great game"
Positive,"So far it runs surprisingly well with full ultra+RT on 4080 in QHD. It's an incredibly visually appealing game with strong production values and very cool Chinese voiceover (what? yeah!). It is also stable even with agressive alt-tabbing.The game itself is closer to something like God of War reboot than Souls, thank goodness. There is no penalty for death and after few initial bosses you know the combat system well enough to play at your own pace.The only downside is that not every piece of text in the game is translated so far, plus the first hour or so could be a little too cutscene-heavy.Otherwise, it's a very beautiful game with deep yet easy to learn combat system and easy to follow plot."

Positive,10/10Keep it up China.
Positive,You know how long i've been waiting for this!?Woooo im about to make a name for myself here!
Positive,"So after 60+ hours of playtime and completing the game in NG+ for some extra achievements, here’s my review for Wukong :))Game Science came out of nowhere and dropped what could easily be a game of the year. Wukong is now one of my top 5 must-play games that every gamer should experience. It was my most anticipated game of 2024, and it definitely lives up to the hype. It feels like a mix of God of War and Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order—it's not entirely Souls-like but definitely takes inspiration from games like Dark Souls.Pros:Rich Lore: Based on Journey to the West, it offers a fresh and engaging story about the Monkey King.Unique Combat Mechanics: The “Transformation” system adds variety to fights, letting you switch forms with different abilities.Stunning Graphics: The game looks amazing, with detailed environments and dynamic lighting that make the world come alive.Great Soundtrack: The music blends traditional Chinese instruments with cinematic scores, enhancing the immersive experience.Immersive World: The detailed environment and lore make exploring and discovering new things very rewarding.Engaging Boss Fights: Boss encounters are well-designed, offering challenging and memorable experiences.Cons:Occasional Repetitiveness: Some enemy types and combat scenarios might feel repetitive over time and can get a bit boring.Audio Issues: The language can randomly switch between English and Chinese, which can be really annoying.Overall, Wukong shines with its engaging story, unique combat, and stunning visuals. Despite a few minor issues, it’s a must-play for anyone who enjoys deep stories and exciting gameplay.Rating: 8.5/10"
Positive,games a whole movie. beautiful. amazing. perfect. 10/10. GOTY cheers
Positive,this game is amazing. gotta be the best journey west themed game of all time (there aren't man to be fair). Plays like most hardcore action games with skill trees and difficult bosses. Not as hard as the souls games but also difficult enough to keep you engaged. Aesthetically GORGEOUS transports you to another world. Buddhist horror is a great aesthetic!!!
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong is a fun action game that takes inspiration from a bunch of modern games to create it's own thing. The gameplay structure, level design, navigation, menus and gear upgrades remind me heavily of the recent god of war games, while the combat feels like a mesh of games like Sekiro and Nioh. It does things different enough though and the quality is there that it doesn't feel like a blatant rip off. The game’s visuals are really good. The attention to detail in character models, environments, and special effects is nothing short of impressive. The art direction beautifully captures the essence of Chinese mythology, it feels both otherworldly and grounded in cultural authenticity.The combat is initially exciting, with fast-paced action and a variety of abilities and transformations that keep things interesting. However, as you progress, the combat begins to feel repetitive. Despite the initial thrill, the lack of variety in the combos makes going through these levels start to feel like a chore because you are mashing the same light attack combo with the same animation for over 30 hours. The different stances don't offer the variety needed because they are just heavy attack finishers after doing the same light attack combo. All the fundamentals are there, i just needed more animation variety when i was spamming that light attack. The boss design however is a particular standout, with each encounter feeling unique and all the different movesets make every fight feel fresh. The sheer number of bosses is very impressive, its the aspect of the game they definitely went all out on.The level design was disappointing. While the environments are visually stunning, the actual design of the levels feels too basic and bland. Chapter 2 and 3 in particular a lot of the time feel like wastelands of desert and snow that you are just running through, they lack density. This mixed with the repetitive combat makes navigating these levels feel like a chore at times just hoping to get to the next boss soon. The story didn't do much for me. It's is rooted in rich folklore and it relies heavily on it while failing to tell a story on it's own. The writing is way too vague to get me invested in any way. The atmosphere, on the other hand, remains captivating throughout, driven by the strong world-building and mythical elements.Overall it's a good game with standout visuals, impressive boss design, and a unique setting, but it falls short from being anything more than that personally due to the repetitive combat, bland level design and a lackluster story.7/10 (Good)"
Positive,"Maaaaan, this game has been such a nice surprise!Positives:- Wonderful combat- Drop Dead Gorgeous Graphics- Controls are nice and smooth- Story is good so far- Huge Variety in Environments/Biomes- Well crafted Game world- Cool setting that we don't see very often with Chinese Mythology- Great audio- Atmosphere is top notch- The Calymation style cutscene at the end of Chapter 2 was unreal, dem feels!- Tons of really cool abilities to try out and use- So far it runs well, 60fps on PC with Ray Tracing on Full, Frame Gen, DLSS & Quality & Settings @ Very High with a 4060ti & 5700x & 32Gb of Ram. Or if I want more FPS I keep the same settings as above except I turn off Ray Tracing and I get 120fps.(Also runs on Steam Deck to at 30fps which I was not expecting, considering how amazing the game looks!). Also ZERO crashes.Negatives:- Would be nice to have the option to invite a friend for boss fights ala Dark Souls/Elden Ring- HDR option would be niceOverall the game is fantastic so far and I don't have any negatives really yet. So far I have not had any crashes or FPS issues and I am loving the combat, the game world, the graphics, the audio and the setting alot!These devs did a wonderful job on there first ever PC and Console game, top notch stuff here and its up there with my favorite games of 2024 so far. Probably in my personal Top 3 of the year with Elden Ring Expansion and Hellblade 2.The game is a nice mix of say the Combat and Boss style of Elden Ring/Dark Souls, but with the Linear world and style use of Mythology of God Of War. Chinese Mythology has not been done that often in videogames, never mind this well before, this is Top notch stuff so far. Played 2 and a half hours before bed and I am already itching to play more of it tomorrow.If you want tons of bosses to fight and a a gorgeous world to explore and a cool setting, pick this game up ASAP, you can tell the devs put alot of love, blood, sweat and tears into this one.I wouldn't call this a full blown Souls like game but it does have some elements like Dark Souls and Elden Ring, but it also has a ton of its own ideas and unique aspects to. These devs COOKED for there first time ever making a PC and console game."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong wastes no time in throwing you into the action as you take control of Sun Wokung, the Monkey King rebelling against the celestial court. Here you get a small window into all the powers you'll eventually obtain throughout the game. After the duel with Erlang seems to conclude, the time of Sun Wukung ends and after ages pass, a nameless monkey rises to the task of re-obtaining the powers of the Monkey King to finish what he started.As the nameless monkey (aka The Destined One), you start with nothing more than the martial prowess to hit things with a staff & the power to perpetually re-spawn at the last shrine you've visited. Granted you'll get a few new tricks early on but like any Souls-like, you're own familiarity with combat moves/timing of both you & your enemies will be a required skill throughout this journey. Dodging & to a lesser extent stamina use will also serve you well despite any new powers or combat stance you may want to try out. This may sound like a lot and it kind of is, but the game eases you in to each new power & you're encouraged to respec as it's free to do at any shrine so experiment as needed.Enemy variety is a highlight in this game with each area showcasing threats that thematically match what's around you. In a creepy forest? Expect bug assassins waiting to drop from the treetops to attack. Near a volcano? Here's a few fire mages to rain fire from above. Typical From Software stuff but impressive to see with a new studio. Most bosses & sub-bosses are enjoyable to tackle with unique dialogue at times depending on your actions & some really cool bombastic attacks for even the more obscure encounters. Fights never feel truly unfair & can be overcome to some extent with some extra leveling.Map/level design is fantastic, each area has a great sense of history & what's happened in the wake from the end of Sun Wukong's rebellion. Abandoned temples, crumbing kingdoms or ruins partially consumed by nature. References by enemies & various destruction in environments also lend to world-building. Each side path or side quest is all designed with purpose with an optional boss battle or secret area to be reached. Note that there is a significant amount of easily missable side content, and while there's new game+ available, I do recommend reading some kind of guide if you want to see everything. (I'm serious on that last sentence, there is literally content that would be nearly impossible to find on your own.)Soundtrack is really good, it gives a sense of adventure, excitement, & grand scale if that makes sense. Sort of reminds me of something like Lord of the Rings. Voice acting (at least for English) was far better than I was expecting, there really was an effort made to match the dialogue to lip sync and the actors did a great job all around. I would imagine Chinese would also be very good with subtitles to add to the experience. Graphical fidelity also looks exceptional with a very high level of detail even with common enemies or random objects littered throughout the map.Naturally all this comes with a performance price but the use of Unreal Engine here does allow for good scalability, you aren't really losing much even at the low preset. Although I can't say this will entirely eliminate any kind of UE stuttering during traversal. For those using NVIDIA GPUs, you will need to replace the DLSS DLL file as it's outdated which you can do fairly easily by downloading the newest version online or using DLSS Swapper. NVMe drive over a SATA SSD as the installation location is also something I recommended to ensure sufficient data streaming especially in the later chapters. Note that any NVIDIA driver update seems to also require a rebuild of the shader cache which takes a few minutes to wait for.This game can easily be anyone's personal GOTY & may also be mine (we'll see with Silent Hill 2 out now). The fact that a new studio in China spent years accomplishing this AAA single player experience is incredible, especially when considering how focused most Chinese gaming companies are on the mobile market. If you're a fan of Souls-likes or character action games, you really owe it to yourself to play this.This review is provided by the 𝓕𝓾𝓷𝓴𝔂 𝓙𝓪𝓵𝓪𝓹𝓮𝓷𝓸𝓼 (Curation Page  |  Steam Group) and the support of readers like you, thank you."

Positive,"Insanely good game, basically a mix of god of war/elden ring + boss rush.Beautifully crafted with an insane scenery, after every fight you can just sit back and enjoy the viewslots of very fun bosses, with cool and nice fighting animations, hitting that perfect dodge is always a glorious momentruns pretty great on my pc too, amd 5600x + rtx3070ti + 32gb, at 1440p, runs around 90~ fps with high settings, dlss on, frame generation off.sounds are also top notch and the soundtracks are good. Chinese dub is 10x better than the english counterpart.I can only recommend this one, big Game of the Year contender, maybe even winner"

Positive,"Black Myth Wukong save my life:one of the best games I ever played in my life. it has perfect combat system, beautiful world, and environment.the boss designed is very perfect with no repeat system, i finished all the main and side bosses and all of them were perfect, didnt get boring during any chapter or boss fight. Thank you for all the people who worked for this perfect game 100/100"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong—or as I like to call it, ""The Monke Experience""—has rightfully claimed the title of Game of the Year 2024. This game is so next-level it feels like a cheeky slap in the face to anyone who dared underestimate it.The graphics? Unreal. The combat? Top-notch, with boss fights that make you work for that victory. And the experience? Fresh, bold, and completely bananas.In a gaming world full of copy-paste formulas, Black Myth: Wukong swings in, flips the script, and delivers an unforgettable ride. Absolute. Cinema."
Positive,"Review after 100%.Visuals and Sounds:This game is genuinely one of the best-looking ARPGs I've played in recent years. The visuals and sounds are very immersive and detailed, the presentation was done so well that it would make me not want to progress but walk around, listen to the sound, and appreciate the details in the environment. Ghost of Tsushima was another one close to this level of stunning visuals but with a different artistic approach, it was beautiful in a way that's artificially enhanced to a point beyond realistic, but I don't feel that in BM:W, and honestly I prefer this art style more, not every piece of maps has to scream gorgeous, if the environment is to be mono-toned then it should be, that's what makes a game immersive. Even in mono-toned maps, because there are details everywhere, the game never felt boring to look at. The music and sound effects in the game are overall very good, not something out of this world but very polished, I would feel the different atmosphere throughout the game, whether during exploration, cut-scene or a boss fight.Combat:Combat is fluid and satisfying, there is no input action queue so you will need to pay attention to what your character is doing instead of just smashing buttons, which is fine otherwise the game would be too easy. Sometimes the input not registering in fights would get me killed but overall it's a very minor issue. This game also lacks a bit in the variety of weapon arts/moveset compared to similar games in this genre but overall it's still solid. Gameplay:Boss variety is probably one of the best out there, no re-skinned clone and each encounter is a unique experience. Most of the boss designs are based on Chinese Mythology or Journey to the West with only very few exceptions, and it's such a treat to see how many were put in the game. The only issue for me was some of the bigger bosses' hitboxes were done poorly, mainly just Hundred-Eye, other than that they were all fun to fight against.  Difficulty-wise is on the easier side for those who's experienced in ARPG/Soulslike, close to God of War Balanced I would say. There were a few bosses that I felt over-tuned at first but later on, I realized it was intended for players to reminisce the experience of how Wukong fought those bosses with the help of different vessels in JTTW, which can be found in different secret areas in each map. Some might find it a ridiculous design but the story and exploration in those secret areas was probably one of my favorite things about this game since they were the original JTTW timeline and brought back so many memories. One of the issues people mentioned was no map in this game, it didn't bother me that much besides chapter 3, as soon as I found out the torches/braziers were the guide it became much less of an issue. There are invisible walls throughout the game that they could've done a better job indicating, but it's not an issue that I run into often enough that's ruining the experience, it's not an open-world after all so walls should be expected.I have only had 2 crashes throughout the entire time I played, one at the beginning of the game right after the intro cut-scene, and 1 crash during the game when I was surrounded by a ton of mobs that shot different things at me. Overall performance was good except for the final chapter where I noticed a bit of performance drop, but also expected given the map design essentially forces you to render the entire map.Story:The story could be a bit confusing for those who are not familiar with JTTW, we play as the destined one, and as we embark on our journey to retrieve Wukong's six indriyas/sense-organs, we meet different characters that show different states of mental torment of our human nature, our greed, aversion, ignorance, pride, and jealousy. I think some of the philosophical ideas in the game around Buddhism and human nature are not only very hard to translate, but were also presented in an obscure way. It's not something to critic as everyone has different taste when it comes to mysterious lore, nonetheless, I think it still did a fantastic job at depicting some of the stories from JTTW throughout the game with all the different side quests. The quality of the cinematic and animation throughout the game is also insane, if you haven't read JTTW you will be missing out on the context but regardless it's still amazing to watch even if you have no idea what's going on.Verdict:It is by no means perfect, but despite its flaws, it's still a great and unique experience and I enjoyed it, if you like ARPGs then it's worth trying."
Positive,"Özeti baştan geçeceğim. Çok bir umudum olmadan aldığım Wukong beni gerçekten her çok şaşırttı ve bu yıl şu ana kadar oynadığım en iyi oyun oldu.Oyun oynanış olarak zaten sade ve eğlenceli ama sürekli yeni hareketler, büyüler, bürünülecek şekiller ve geliştirmeler buluyoruz ve yelpazemiz genişliyor. Genişledikçe de oyun derinleşiyor. Üstüne karşımıza çıkan her düşmanın ve özellikle de bossların farklı mekanikleri bizi sürekli yeni taktikler geliştirmeye zorluyor. Oyun çok kolay değil ama sizi cezalandıran bir zorluğu da yok ve düşmanlarınızı yenebilmeniz için her şeyi size veriyor. Oldukça hızlı olmanız gereken bir oyun ve kendine has bir ritmi var düşmanına göre değişen. Oynanış hep akıcı ve üst seviye eğlenceli. Düşmanların kafasına bütün gücünüzle geçirdiğiniz odunu çok güzel hissettiriyor oyun bize. Büyüler, eşyalar ve özelliklerde birden fazla oynamayı hakkedecek kadar geliştirilebiliyor.Haritaları başlarda küçük görünse de ilerledikçe dallanıp budaklanıyor ve genişliyor. Harita tasarımları genel olarak güzel ve bir sürü ufak tefek gizli mekan, nesne ve boss var. Kestirmeler ve gizli haritalarda buna eklenince gayet yeterli bir oyun süresi sunuyor bize dolu dolu.Oyunun zirve yaptığı yer ise sanat yönetmenliği, grafikler, müzikler, karakterlerin diyalogları, her bölümde türü değişen bölüm arası videolar her adımda mest ediyor sizi. Fare dövmeye gelmişken bir anda kendinizi kafası olmayan bir ozanın şarkılarına ritm tutarken buluyorsunuz. Mekanların büyük kısmı Çin deki tapınaklardan direkt aktarılmış veya ilham alınmış ve hepsi büyüleyici görünüyor. Karlı dağlardaki Budha heykelleriyle dolu dehlizlerden tutun, lavların arasındaki bir tapınağın işlemelerine kadar her şey olağan üstü, en ufak detaya bile özen gösterilmiş.Oyunun ""journal""i ise ayrı bir övgüyü hakkediyor. Sadece buradaki karakter hikayelerini okuyarak Çin mitolojisinin büyük kısmını öğrenebilirsiniz. Hikayeler hem eğlenceli hem de yürek dağlıyorlar. Sizi sinir eden bir düşmanın gerçek yüzünü öğrenince hafiften dumur oluyorsunuz.Başta da dediğim gibi oyun beni resmen büyüledi ve nefes almadan oynadım. Bir kaç ufak sorunu var belki ama günümüz oyunlarına göre çok komik sorunlar bunlar ve yüzlerce çalışanı olan multinasyonel firmalar bu kadar stabil oyun yapamıyorlar. Bütün içtenliğim ile her oyunsevere tavsiye ediyorum, hele ki God of War tarzı oyunları seviyorsanız.  Ne yazık ki ülkemizde artık çok pahalı oyunlar ve hobimizi rahatça tavsiye edemez hale geldik ama bu yıl 1 tane oyun alacaksanız o da bu olsun."

Positive,"This game is truly remarkable for many reasons, but I have to give a special shout-out to the ""Music Videos"" that play at the end of each chapter. The multiple art styles used are impressive enough, but the way they convey their stories in engaging short segments makes you want to learn more outside of the game. Chapter 4's video is my personal favorite, but honestly, they're all so impressive that it’s hard to pick just one as a runner-up. If you haven't played this game yet, you absolutely should!"
Positive,"Game of the year contender for sure. The art direction and sound design is so good in this game. They kept true to the story of Journey to the West that this is based on.The boss designs are also very cool.After 100% it, i can say that the game is hard at first but in NG+ it gets quite easy that base game. Totally recommend."

Positive,"I’ll review this game wearing two different hats. As a game designer, most of us unintentionally critique a game with our design hat on. So, here it is:After a long time, a truly beautiful combat game has been released. The game is simply addictive—the feel, the combat, the sound of the staff’s impact, the voice acting—it’s all on point. But the most captivating part of the game is the BOSS FIGHTS! This game reignited my love for boss rushes, keeping me on my toes. One boss down, and here comes the next! In just 30 minutes of gameplay, I fought four bosses. The combat is perfection, like bread and butter.As for the narrative, it feels cryptic at first, but if you pay a little attention, it’s beautifully presented. The game feels like a dance; more than just an Action RPG, it’s a rhythm game. You attack, watch, dodge, and attack again. Enemies have their own rhythm, and you counter them with your own.Now, the downside: exploration. As someone who loves to explore, this game is dangerous for me because it has no map, which leaves me feeling lost, wandering in circles. The organic design of the environments makes everything look similar. Overall, the game is a brilliant piece of art, challenging enough for everyone to enjoy well-designed bosses without being punishingly difficult—unlike some other games.Design Perspective:Putting on my design hat now, I’ve had conversations with peers who claim the game is shallow in its combat and exploration. At first, I kind of agreed, but after playing the game extensively, I realized that’s not entirely accurate. The statement comes from comparing this game to others like God of War, Devil May Cry, Ghost of Tsushima, or Nier Automata.Wukong doesn’t have shallow combat; its depth is peak within its own territory. The game is perfection, with depth for both spammers and masters alike. Want to spam? Go ahead. Prefer to use nuanced parries, timing, and charged attacks? You can do that too. The game gives you the option to redo your abilities and try bosses with new strategies. Almost every upgrade is reversible, allowing you to play however you want.As someone whose favorite combat game is Devil May Cry, I can confidently say that while DMC doesn’t force you to master combos to complete the game, Wukong does because of its nature. The enemies and bosses will wreck you, and that’s where the game shines. It forces you to adapt.While God of War might have more depth, that’s a different game with different demands. Wukong doesn’t require that level of depth, but within its scope, it’s at its peak.One major drawback, however, is the level design and visual clarity. The visuals aren’t clear enough to indicate whether an area is accessible. What looks like a climbable stone from afar turns out to be blocked by an invisible barrier when you get closer. The sense of direction in the game is practically non-existent, with no proper landmarks to help you understand where you are. The organic level design, while interconnected, can make navigation difficult, especially since you can sometimes reach areas without following the critical path. The only sure way to know you’re on the right track is to keep moving from boss to boss.Conclusion:Overall, after a long time, I’ve found a game that I look forward to playing after a long day of work. It challenges me just enough to keep me engaged without making me want to give up, unlike other games. And finally, let me emphasize: it’s not a Souls-like. Also, don’t give up at the big-headed mini-boss in the beginning!"

Positive,"2024 - The year of monke.A really excellent souls-like action RPG based around ancient Chinese mythology with beautiful graphics, inventive and weird boss designs and super fluid combat. There's so many cool abilities and moves to unlock and they all feel badass to execute. Every magic power has it's use and you'll need them because this game is pretty tough.There's mechanics inspired by Dark Souls but the combat feels more similar to hack n slash games like Devil May Cry or the old school God Of War games, it's fast and frantic whereas the Souls games are more deliberate. I didn't do much research on the game before buying other than knowing it's a monke-like so this was really surprising and cool. Everything feels so slick and nice to control, i don't really have many complaints.I have so much more to do in the game but i'm already convinced that this is definitely one of the best games of the year.Also a big budget AAA game which released with no game breaking bugs, microtransactions or dumbass agenda other than letting you play as a superhero monke man?You're fucking right mate!"
Positive,"Flawed experience and questionable design choices of the game that can sauer the fun part. Lets get the meaty part of the game that actually is fun. You play as Monke that is master of martial arts and uses its staff to overcome dangerous world. You cant get better than this. Flawlessly executed world building and graphical design. Every minute of a gameplay just want to stop and admire every detail, flower, butterfly or statue that calmly hums on meditation. Tons of lore and describtions about each figure you encounter or kill. Needless to say this is fine journey that could have been better delivered. Now if you don’t know anything about Journey to the west don’t worry their people know but the game decided to go easier route and not explain anything whats going on. You just follow some footsteps to fulfill something or become so strong to face the gods. The issue is the presentation. The game just going and going but not providing meaning. Why do I fight them or whos this little fella that joins me. At it becomes just another random run and kill everything game. Somewhere somehow developers thought this will be good. If only it was so simple because there is another cherry on the top. There is no map or navigation star. You just left alone to explore and go by you paste. Its fine I can handle this but after chapter 2 it becomes draining end exhausting because levels become multilayered and massive areas. They are pretty as hell but it becomes more tedious than fun to remember every corner where to go or what you missed. Masive misstep from developers. No sure what were they thinking. And finally meat and potatoes. It no secret this game is huge boss encounter tale right. Some are fun some are painful. Baisically there are no rest for suprises and you will get them a lot which is very nice. So many cool moments that are memorable. But sadly developers thought that massive health pool for bosses will be a great idea. No matter how you good equipped or prepared main bosses have to much HP or your weapon don’t do much of a damage. Well at least you have many tools to deal with them. Last thing I wanted to address that they have done very bad job with big sized bosses. The camera is to close zoomed in to your character and when huge chonker Bear swings hes massive paws at you you don’t see it because you basically see hes but and left leg. The camera doesn’t zoom out and its very very frustrating to play this way and there are more than few of these encounters. Will give it positive cause its Monke but be warned its not perfect game."

Positive,"I just finished the game and it's a solid 9/10! I had a great experience!I never thought I would enjoy what seemed to be like a souls-like combatwise, but the game was much more than that. Rather than the sluggish, slow pace of souls-likes, Wukong is fast-paced, dynamic and fun from the go. As you advance, you get more tools in the form of spells, transformations, items, etc. to tackle the hardest of opponents. The gameplay is an immense joy from start to finish.I had some issues following the story, as I know next to nothing about the legend of Sun Wukong. The game is an imagined sequal to Sun Wukongs legacy, so I would say knowing about it beforehand will elevate the story for you. That being said, the chapter stories are well told and executed and carried some emotional weight as well. World and feeling is amazing. The game looks beautiful and it ran well on my four year old rig. I had to tune some settings, but the game ran at 80-100+ fps at all times - and looked stunning, even with some settings turned way down. A downside about the game world is first of all a lack of a map - there are so many areas, secret ones included (I managed to finish them all with A LOT of backtracking). The areas have lots of invisible walls and it's not always clear where you are ""allowed"" to go or not. Other games border the play area a lot better and more clearly. The game (side content included) was just shy of 50 hours, which is absolutely worth the money imo. I've yet to go New Game+, but I know that it has more (new) items, spells, etc. and could be a fun romp. I highly recommend this game :-)"
Positive,"I am gonna share my honest opinion about this game:The game is good but combat could have been more better , It felt like spamming and not much of skill  come into play. Moreover it mostly rely on the special abilities.* Visuals- 9/10* Story - 9/10* Combat - 7/10If you have an anger issues like me. Please stay away from this game."

Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is nothing short of a revelation in the action RPG landscape. From the very first moments, it’s clear that this game is a labor of love. The game boasts a breathtakingly beautiful world, brought to life with rich, detailed environments and fluid character animations. The visual design not only captures the mythological essence of the story but also immerses players in a vividly realized fantasy world.Black Myth: Wukong is a standout title that manages to blend spectacular visuals, innovative gameplay, and a captivating story into a truly memorable experience. It’s a must-play for anyone who loves action RPGs and is eager for a fresh, exciting adventure."
Positive,"Gaahd damn when it comes to redefining the action RPG genre, Black Myth: Wukong sets a new gold standard. spent countless hours immersed in its world, I can confidently say it’s one of the best game I’ve ever played.  In terms of performance the game runs smoothly, with minimal glitches or hiccups.Every corner of the game feels alive, filled with lore, secrets, and stunning vistas. The attention to detail is evident in every aspect, from the environmental storytelling to the intricately designed enemy encounters. The side quests are not just filler but are meaningful and enhance the overall narrative, making exploration a rewarding endeavour.If you’re a fan of action RPGs or simply enjoy games that offer a rich, immersive experience, Black Myth: Wukong is an absolute must-play.TY chat GPT, have no idea what i said but im sure its very positive."
Positive,"Probably the best game of 2024 (so far). Easy 9/10Pros- NO MTX, aggressive monetization or predatory practices- Satisfying and fun gameplay- Gorgeous graphics- Enjoyable story- Great music- Well-acted and directed cutscenes (both English and Chinese)- Plenty of reason to replay after first playthrough- Huge enemy and boss varietyCons- Denuvo DRM- Combat can be a bit one dimensional, and some might find it lacks depth- Invisible walls everywhere- Quite demanding on the hardware (RTX 3080 10GB + 5800X at 1440p hovers around 60fps with Digital Foundry recommended settings)- Medium Ray Tracing setting breaks water.- Shader comp stutters. Even tho the game compiles shaders on startup, every time a new effect or enemy attacks occurs, i got a stutter.Overall, an easy recommendation for someone looking for an incredible single player experience, well worth the money even at full price."

Positive,"I'm about to finish chapter 3, the game so far is really good. But it's a 8.5/10 kinda of good, aside from graphics, don't expect any ground breaking innovation from this game.It's a fairly linear title that focus on combat. Like , a good 50% of your playtime is gonna be bossfights (more if you suck at action games).Speaking of difficulty, this is NOT an easy game. There are no difficulty options, no summons or online co-op. The GDR aspects are very marginal and you can't really cheese bosses with OP builds. So you have to Get Good. It aint Sekiro but expect a difficulty comparable to the average fromsoftware title. My biggest gripe with the game so far is the level design, constantly plagued with invisible walls and maps that often loop around in a very disorienting way. Chapter 2 was especially bad in this regard.The game doesn't have a minimap, nor a compass. And despite the linearity, it does have a fairly good amount of secrets so it's not like you can freely sprint around the map.Chapter 3 has a lot of open areas with very few points of intererest and , again, multiple routes that lead to the same destination. And you have to take all of them or you'll miss out on a lot of optional content including the most important side quests. The combat is fun but can be very repetitive if you don't actively play around with the different skills and stances of the skill tree. The combat is kept intersting by the very good boss variety. I think i fought more bosses in 20 hours than a full playthrough of a souls game. So in conclusion: if you like combat focused action games and you don't really care about story or level design, this is for you."
Positive,"Review after 100%Just to quickly summarise, Black Myth Wukong has exceeded all my expectations I had coming into playing this for the first time. Firstly, the graphics are too hard not to praise. The world is stunning, and if you have a beefy GPU, then push it to its limit so you can experience the stunning world the game has to offer. Personally I have a 4070Ti and never came across any crashes or game breaking bugs which killed my session completely. For the most part this game is optimized very well and I had no troubles with severe FPS drops, just the odd drop here and there.There are many side quests and secrets, too. Some which can be frustrating as certain bosses are only weaker to a specific item that you have to find yourself to make the boss fight far easier. I had spent far more time fighting bosses in these games compared to the Souls series! Each boss will test your memory so you can predict the next attacks they're about to make, allowing for barely any room for error.Speaking of bosses, there's an abdundance of them! Enemy design in Black Myth: Wukong is also nothing short of spectacular, with the game boasting countless variants of hostiles, known as yaoguai, and nearly 80 bosses to encounter during your whole playthrough. You’ve got everything from masked monks and giant spider creatures to zodiac animals to celestial entities, and even a great dragon that flies around while striking you with lightning. Sometimes the camera can be your biggest enemy as you've likely experienced that with Elden Ring/ Dark Souls, but here it's not as bad, only with certain dragon fights it can become a pain, but nothing to negatively pin point as the enemy variety keeps this from being a huge issue.Surprisingly enough, there’s no map whatsoever, and I do admit to getting lost several times. However, I embraced the chance of exploration, investigating mysterious locales and facing all sorts of perils. Without any hand-holding, I was free to explore to my heart’s content — which naturally made discoveries even more rewarding. The game is linear enough, with the surroundings stopping you from trying to explore places you're not able to step foot in, which I understand to some can be frustrating.As far as levelling up goes, there are lots of spells, abilities, and armour/weapon sets to gather if you're an avid achievement hunter. Many of these will naturally come through general exploration, but some will need you to progress to a specfic part of the game to gain the necessary resouces to make these purchases late game.All in all, Black Myth: Wukong is an astounding success as the stats have already proven to us, one that blends a story celebrating Chinese mythology, all complemented by spectacular design and excellent combat and boss variety. The audio and soundtrack compliments this setting super well and delivers a fanastic adrenaline rush when coming across new boss fights. I'm sure this game will be in contention for GOTY no doubt, and my overall score would be a great 9/10I highly recommend this game, and thanks to the developers for putting out such an amazing passion project where you can see how much attention to detail they've implemented."
Positive,It seems like I am the only one experiencing problems when it comes to the cinematic part of the game. The game play is completely smooth besides the cut scenes. The cut scenes are very choppy and not in sync with the characters dialogue for some reason.

Positive,"After playing for 10 hours straight, I am thrilled to describe Black Myth: Wukong as my personal GOTY, or Game of the Year. For me Wukong displays many aspects that tick all the boxes for me. While not open world, the game is huge in linear fashion. You explore the beautifully put together world of Wukong fighting enemy types of many kinds. Practically no one is your friend, most are your foe. Your goal is to progress through each locale and defeat enemy after enemy. There are many foes, mini-bosses, and actual level bosses. It feels almost endless. The game does a great job keeping you busy while impressing you with quick game-play with beautiful graphic effects of many element types, such as electricity, water, thunder, fire, and mist.It is not a Souls game nor is it a souls-like, as much as it looks to be. Many games nod toward the genre with resting at a specific location to recover heath while also re-spawning foes. For example, the Tomb Raider series does this but was never claimed as a souls-like. Black Myth: Wukong allows the player to collect and carry many things, but even after adventuring leading to the player's death, the player keeps all the items collected.The fighting style is fun, if you're not a Souls lover, and more of a Mortal Kombat noobie, this can be fun for you. Button mashing can help you defeat many foes, and if you're a combo specialist you can be the master of brilliant combos that impress your eyes. You can improve your Wukong by purchasing new skills and traits from the items collected throughout the world. It's not difficult depending on what type of player you are.There are only two languages at launch. Chinese and English, both come with subtitles. The voice acting is best in the developer's original language of Chinese, in my opinion.The opening scene is peak cut scenes with game play that matches or even surpasses the quality that GOD of War displays. You will be heavily impressed from the time you start the game, given you're on a system that can handle it. For now, the game launches on PC and Sony PlayStation 5, with Xbox left in the dark of when or if those gamers will even have a chance to journey to the west. On PS5, you have three presets to choose from while on PC, you practically have an endless number of choices. I cannot speak too much on the PS5 version as I do not own a copy for that platform. PC is the 'GOD-tier' platform to choose if your hardware supports ray tracing and it gets even better if you have the hardware to play on a 4K OLED display. Your eyes will thank you for the experience.To be honest, I can go on and on, but I really want to get back to the game so I will state this, Steam allows you to purchase and play the game for up to two-hours leaving you eligible for a refund for any reason you find yourself with buyer's remorse. So, play for 119 minutes and make a choice to keep going or get your monies back.One last thing, because of the players in China, Black Myth: Wukong is now the only single player game to have ever had 2,223,179 concurrently players on Steam (PC) at one time. This makes it beat the latest two game of the year titles, Baldur's Gate 3 and ELDEN RING. Only second to one game, PUBG which sits as number one."
Positive,Game Of The Year!!!!

Positive,"Honest Review after having 100% Completed the game. And no, I’m not a Chinese Bot. I’m a Mexican Vagabond that enjoys videogames and reading (And I was already invested into The Journey to the West Novel)Black Myth Wukong is my favorite game of 2024, period. I was already hyped for the game long before release, and after having completed the game by myself I can tell you confidently that the wait was definitely worth it. BUT… The game is not perfect, it’s a Flawed Experience.Let’s get out of the way the things this Game set-out to do and does amazingly; You will enjoy striking visuals across the whole journey, paired with an amazing soundtrack that pays tribute to the Original TV Series of AJTTW, packed together with lots of content and lots, lots of secrets, also every single enemy, boss and character gets a Lore Portrait (Beautifully drawn in traditional Chinese style) that explains their background, associations and so much more.The Game was designed to pay tribute not only to The Journey to the Wast Novel, but also to be an Epic Experience as You come across different characters and various conflicts involving the Celestial Court and the now lost Sun Wukong.And in that regard the Game exceeded my expectations completely. However, we need to remember that we’re talking about a Videogame after all, and that’s were my criticism comes from…Game Science focused so much on the Cinematic and Visual experience that they forgot they were developing a Game. Black Myth Wukong’s Gameplay is Lackluster, Uninspired and quite frankly unresponsive to say the least. They literally grabbed the WORST elements of the FromSoft Souls Combat and combined it with a Button Masher/Hack and Slash/Action Game like God of War 2018 and it just doesn’t work because those elements don’t mix well, they are completely incompatible. They could have made BMW a Full-Blown Action Game that empowers the Player Choice and Skill Expression, but that’s not what we got.Let me quickly list what we got:Stamina and Mana Management, Estus Flasks, Un-Telegraphed Attacks that come out of no-where at almost impossible to react speeds, Command Grabs that don’t look like grabs, Wanky Boss Hitboxes and a Skill Tree that is a complete slog to get through because You don’t get that many level ups in this game, a Terrible Attack Moveset that I thought would completely change once I switched to the other 2 different Staff Stances, but it doesn’t change at all, as it only changes what the heavy attacks do. All of this combined with the fact that enemies later in the game have way too much health makes the game frustrating to play. First of all, Stamina and Mana Management has NO-RIGHT being in a Game like BMW were the Game clearly expects You to play as aggressively as possible to stagger your foes. Enemies and Bosses attack at a fast pace, deal a lot of damage and most importantly are very unpredictable at times. This just forces the player to take the game slowly and save mana strictly for bosses which is just bad design as 1) The Cooldowns for Skills are already stupidly high and 2) The only Drink You get to replenish mana in Chapter 4, HARDLY restores 25ish Mana Points per Gourd use, to put that into perspective, some spells costs between 40-80 Mana points.Second of all, the Blocking/Parrying mechanic should have been implemented as a NORMAL Move, and not a Skill that You Unlock later in Chapter 2, that is simply out-righteous considering that the player doesn’t have good or consistent ways to avoid damage as the dodge button consumes a lot of stamina early on and doesn’t have a lot of i-frames. Not to mention that most Bosses in the game attack surprisingly fast regardless of size, and their attacks are not telegraphed at all.Light Attacks cannot be cancelled, you have to commit to every single swing, and trust me, attack animations in this game are longer than they had any right to be, You also get staggered from ANY attack and placed in an animation Stun lock that lasts forever if You’re not smashing the Dodge button.Charging Heavy Attacks also shouldn’t consume Stamina, Instead the Attack itself should deplete more Stamina to compensate for the extra damage.There’s also a lot of Range Enemies that You’re completely unable to deal with properly because the player character has no range attacks of his own which is hilarious because in the final boss fight Wukong has a couple of range attacks where he throws his staff at You like a boomerang. I wonder if they didn’t give the player any range attacks to make the game harder.Staff Stances are almost pointless, they only change what the Focus Heavy Attacks do and objectively Thrust Stance is the best because it unlocks an Infinite Combo Reset with i-frames, Smash Stance and Pillar Stance are only good against certain bosses and that’s it.The way Staff Stances should have been implemented should have been exactly like how Yakuza 0, and Lost Judgment handled Fighting Styles. Each Staff Stance should have granted the player with a different Light Attack Moveset, along with a different Heavy Attack Moveset. (Which reminded me that there’s NO HEAVY ATTACK MOVESET, Just Heavy Finishers) And different ways to Block and or Parry attacks.In fact, this game should have hard copied what Yakuza 0 or Lost Judgment did with their Combat System altogether, allowing players to end a Light Attack Combo with a Heavy Attack that is completely different depending on which part of the attack string you decide to input the Heavy Attack. This would have been a lot of fun, not only because of the different animations, but would have also given the player more agency and skill expression, on how to start and end a combo stylishly.Now, talking about Spirits, Imma keep it short here; Spirits are only good for the Stat Increases they provide, because of the unbearable long cooldowns, the fact that they barely deal any damage, and most importantly, the way they trap You in often long animations without any i-frames, often leading to You getting hit or killed (And NO, using Spirits doesn’t grant You defense or Damage Reduction during the animation, alas depending on the Spirit Animation, enemies might hit You and cancel the Spirit Attack altogether too)Transformations are pretty cool BUT they deal too little damage and last too little, I understand that their main purpose is to give You a second health bar and some breathing room, but come on, even while fully upgraded they are barely any better.And last but not least, the Game Design in this game is pretty direction-less, every chapter has multiple sections to explore and fight enemies which is great, unfortunately it’s accompanied with no direction on where to go, and or what it’s needed to progress… not only that, but there’s also a lot of invisible walls that completely break the immersion, these invisible walls are also placed on very random and trivial places as well, making me wonder what the developers were even thinking.In Short: The Combat System in this game is pretty bad, and repetitive as there’s no good combos, player choice or skill expression. The most You will see, is people mastering the dodge and Rock Solid, but that’s it. Every single gameplay video will look exactly the same because there isn’t any options for players to experiment with.Now, let’s talk about the Story and the Protagonist.Black Myth Wukong is yet another one of those games were there’s barely any cutscenes and the players have to piece the story together slowly. There’s absolutely no-explanations about how the world or magic works, the game fully expects players to have read AJTTW prior to better understand the Lore and Characters of the World.Now the Protagonist… Everyone I know loves Sun Wukong, I mean, how could You not? He’s a Rebellious, Stylish Monkey that values his own Freedom and Independence, he isn’t afraid of being himself and that’s why people love him.[Check the comments]"
Positive,"I would recommend anyone this game. + Beautiful world that looks simply amazing, giving you fantastic and unique vistas of forests, mountains, close and distant. + Great gameplay and combat, easy to learn, hard to master, love it! + Unique bosses and strategies + love the skills system and unique summons & different poses. + The lore fun and perfectly presented with cutscenes and lore pages you can read and get into knowing journey to west better. + feels like a really well balance progressions as well. + Hack & slash with a touch of souls-like = perfect for people like me. - no map, I wish there was even a mini map, but nothing. - the game doesn't do well to explain why you want/need to gather all different mats until you progress."
Positive,"Played for atleast 4 hrs and 4-5 bosses. fighting mechanics are good but not for km players. key mapping changeability is very limited. can not assign keys to a particular action. no option for  mouse button 4 and 5 key mappingNow coming to the actual game- the game is average till now except boss fights there is nothing else. will update after completing.After Completing- oh my oh my i was definitely wrong with my initial review, this game is an astonishing piece of artStory- 10/10Gameplay- 10/10Audio- 10/10Graphics-10/10Overall - 9/10Cons- keyboard mouse key mapping is still a issue not solved. some part in chapter 6 looks empty and unfinished. missed(/not added) some cutscenes at the end. Hope DLC will fill thoseGOTY material for me"
Positive,Mind-blowing artwork with thrilling music and mindfully designed levels. An epic callback to childhood memories.
Positive,"It's like watching a kung fu movie on steroids, but you're the star .  Love monke"
Positive,just monkeying around
Positive,Absolutely amazing so far. I haven't had a game drop my jaw in awe in years.
Positive,"Monke, need I say more?"
Positive,"Fun combat, great visuals, plenty of skills to choose and is challenging but not too hard. Definitely a high powered game so can have some performance issues."
Positive,"Whilst I have not finished this game myself, I have seen the game fully from videos and other friends playing the game and I have played a fair amount with the time I have.The first thing I want to disclose is that this game is NOT a souls-like in a traditional sense. You will not find the same mechanics from a souls game here, but you will find a unique combat experience with satisfying mechanics and difficulty behind it. It is difficult, but I don't think souls-like is an accurate description.To say that the combat is the most satisfying thing about the game would be a lie, because the visuals and graphics for this game are absolutely insane and I don't think I have seen a prettier looking game in a very long time. The art direction and creativity with the cutscenes and world design are absolutely fantastic, there was an absolute ton of effort put into this game and it's really obvious to see that. When there is no combat occuring, it almost feels like I am watching a movie with how insane it looks.The boss designs in this game are all very unique, it feels like there is constantly something new thrown into the next fight and whilst there are some points where some bosses are considerably harder than others, there isn't a time where you're hardstuck anywhere because you can always go out in the world and find something else to make yourself stronger.Speaking of going out in the world, the exploration was thankfully not neglected, because it feels very rewarding to go out and explore to find upgrades, level up and so on. I like that there are a lot of optional bosses as well that seem to have an equal amount of effort put into them as some of the main non-optional bosses. The storytelling is also very heavily drawn from Journey to the West, which you should absolutely learn about before or after playing because it is a very interesting story that this game is based on, and you might be able to pick up on key details from Journey to the West.The only negatives I have are the occasional performance issues, but seeing as the game is very new and patches are still being released to address these performance issues, I could see the negatives being ironed out. The game is pretty demanding but with the features such as DLSS being around, it's very possible to run this game with most mid-tier computers.Overall, this game is a 9/10 so far, and I can't wait to continue playing the game. This review might change as I play because I will probably have more to comment on. Definitely pick this game up because it's one of the few games that the price is fully worth it!"

Positive,2nd Best monkey game after BTD6.
Positive,effing bonkers. i love it
Positive,"Button mashy, canned combat, can't call it a Souls-like but art is stunning and the world is very cool. A LOT of invisible walls and small linear corridors are the price of the insane visuals, but the game definitely has its charms."
Positive,"i grew up with this story and i know i'll enjoy it, after i know they reject to pay 7M to SBI bs is another plus point for me, but let be honest, this game is great, but it feels like playing god of war or something like that than playing souls like game. overall i rly enjoy playing this game and i'll finish this game, the only negative is there’s no mini map, so i may get lost while roaming around in the future"
Positive,"It's been a long journey. 132 hours sunk into a game that I had zero intentions on buying until I made a rash decision 4 hours before it released. I'm terrible at games like this. Once I realized in chapter 1 what this was going to be. I could've easily just given up but I didn't. There's no hand holding. No map. Only some mystical smoke leading you to the next checkpoint. The main character doesn't talk every 5 secs telling you where to go. You'll get lost. You may get stuck on a boss for 2 days. You'll get mad and you will most certainly die but it's completely worth it. The graphics are amazing. The artwork, level detail is sometimes a site to behold. Gameplay for me was solid. Performance. Crashed during shader comp. That was the only problem I had. No stutter or any issues that people have mentioned in the discussions. Ran 2560x1440 at a solid 60fps but would flux 90-118 when I had 120 selected. RT turned off and everything set to very high.The over sharpness I dealt with a simple fix. Turned it down on my  monitor and in the Nvidia overlay, I turned it down to 18 and it was good. I don't know... I'm stoked that I beat this. Will definitely do NG+ run. For me it's a 10. The best game I've played all year."

Positive,Monke goes bananas
Positive,peak monkey business
Positive,"10/10 Amazing game. The difficulty is perfectly balanced, the combat is fun, and there's a variety of enemies and locations including boss fights that are fun and challenging as well. Also, the gameplay is very smooth, and the graphics of the game would definitely be considered next-gen."
Positive,"The fact we got a fully fledged, no bullshit, non micro-transaction, FULL single player game FILLED with secrets/extra content already for $60 [Not the $70 trend going on] is mind blowing!Black Myth: Wukong is my personal GOTY 2024 & I feel like they deserve to win that prize. TRULY a masterpiece, w/e the critics and Sweet Baby supporters are saying. THIS GAME FUCKS HARD!! I just finished the game including the secret ending... it was an INSANE ride full of dopamine, hype, excitement, progression .. and I got my money's worth. [MORE than that, and then some.]I feel like this game truly matches, if not surpass on certain things like other big games such as Dark Souls, God Of War etc. Its on that level. I loved the graphics, music, gameplay, progression, heck even the story was pretty freakin awesome and I never read Journey to the West.REALLY hope there is more to come from Game Science!!!"
Positive,"I am a 48 year old father, probably one of the oldest people on steam. I am a single father to my son, who is now 15. My son downloaded steam and in less than a week, he had already played THIS game for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I asked my Son for help and he bought this game for me to play with him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. Wukong has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

Positive,This game didn't represent me! 10/10
Positive,"All this time i've been told to return to monke, now here i am on a long journey of fight gameplay wise similar to a souls like yet narrative wise god of war is the closest to this, thus i enjoy the journey which portrey with great accuracy chinese mythology"
Positive,"My first two hours experience is super solid. I have always been a big fan of Eastern Fantasy. The game is well presented with cinematics and cool story telling. The skills are introduced gracefully. Not as hard as Sekiro or Elden Ring, which I like because  souls games are too hard for me. This way I can appreciate the beautiful environment and art more. I love the mediate function to enjoy a peaceful moment for a bit. Also I want to add that my *laptop* is 10 years old and it can still run this game. The graphics setting is medium on everything but the fight is smooth with lag on scene loading, which is okay. The devs did a good job on optimizing the game. No crash for me."
Positive,Its filling me with overwhelming joy as a weeb.Combat is nice. Heavy Attacks take a bit to get use to but once you understand the focus points a bit better it all comes together really nice im really enjoying it and as someone who doesnt love the overwhelming difficulty of souls likes this is just hard enough most retries for me so far is 11 i think the average elden ring player will think this game is probably a bit too easy but apply restrictions to your abilities you use and itll be fine youll enjoy it. The heavy attacks have been holding me back so far and i also didnt know there was a jump button but once i figured out combat properly it felt fairly natural.

Positive,"This game really makes you ""feel like you are the Monkey"" well crafted well executed fantastic game more than likely the GOTY if not top contender.... I put this game up there with Elden Ring and BG3.  I give it a 7/10 via IGN"
Positive,"Great game, great graphics, the intro i thought it was DBZ lol. Glad I bought an Nvidia Card when they released the 4090. So many people were bashing this game along with the GPU I own. And now the game is out and running perfect. Game Science keep cooking!!!"
Positive,"10 mins into game, i'm a souls player.10/10 on gfx and animation7/10 on fight difficulty, i guess its also catering to new players and not trying to stop players from rage quitting.10/10 on storyboarding.8/10 on voice acting in english, it feels really weird to listen to wukong and asia demon in english. will try the chinese voice over next.solid game so far, will review it again when i'm 100hrs into game."

Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG that excels in visuals, utilizing Unreal Engine 5, but falls short in gameplay. The combat has limited variety beyond different stances, and there are too many Spirit transformations, most of which feel unnecessary. Additionally, the overall balance in gameplay is noticeably lacking."
Positive,"Probably one of the best games i've ever played, nearly 14 hours straight, I'm 30 god damn years old, I haven't sunk that many hours into a game in one sitting since I was like 16 years old. SINGER PLAYER GAMES ARE BACK BAAAAABY"
Positive,"A great addition to the Action RPG genre. The combat feels rewarding and refreshing the setting is iconic and entertaining. The fidelity shines, and the controls feel silky smooth, and mechanically works great. A big win for a new studio in the industry can't wait to hop back in and explore more of this beautiful world.I'd like to add that me as many others thought that this would be a lot more like the souls games but after playing it for myself it feels a lot different while it shares similarities it plays a lot more differently and on a liner scale. It's a lot more action-y."
Positive,"although soul-like games are not my type, this game is beyond expectation. Would appreciate more map/route guidance tho"
Positive,"Playing on Ryzen 4600H, GTX1650, 16GB RAM with SSD. Playing on CN dub and sub.This review is a work in progress, would update further down the road.Although my measly laptop could not squeeze out much frame beyond low-medium settings, I am having a great time so far. The combat is top notch, artstyle immaculate, and voiceover perfected. The performance on my rig is not great, barely reaching 50 fps on mostly low and medium setting with FSR+FG. The first cutscene and boss fight have terrible framerate, dipping to 20 fps on multiple occasion. It is a miracle I managed to finish that fight without my laptop crashing. If Game Science would improve upon the performance further for low end PC like mine, it would be perfect. Update: In the middle of chapter 2 now. After updating my GPU driver, the performance seemed to increase by a little (?). Maybe it is just my imagination. Getting more and more accustomed to the combat, and ho boy, it is such a fun time all around. I have had my gold standard of combat system shaped by one of my favorite game of all time - Sekiro. Although the combat of Wukong is not as tight as Sekiro's, I am having nearly the same amount of fun here as I had experienced in Sekiro. The flashy moves, split second decision making, and crunchy impact of a well pulled off heavy attack is to die for. If I am to nitpick, the lack of map and presence of invisible walls would be my biggest complaint so far, especially in the much more expansive chapter 2 map. Other than that, having a great time so far and looking forward for more monke business.Update:Finally completed Chapter 2, which is a surprising jump in difficulty compared to Chapter 1. The bosses are much more punishing with improper understanding of the already amazing combat systems, forcing you to gid gud to proceed. The performance is still not great, and it forced me to go to all low to avoid stuttering that have costed me several good boss runs. The game also have had strange lag spikes (around 4 or 5 times), where my entire game would ran at 5 fps until I exit and re enter the game, or even having to restart my computer. Not impressed on that part of the experience. Other than the performance issues, Black Myth Wukong is still proving to be a very fun game with great combat mechanics, awesome set pieces, and ridiculously well designed boss battles that will make you sweat and glee at how cool you are when finally surpassing them.Difficulty: 9/10The normal enemies mostly are fodder for your character to wail upon. Some of the bosses are quite easy, but the difficulty ramp up appropriately for important bosses and minibosses that rivaled even the hardest bosses from the souls genre (speaking as someone who had completed DS 1, DS 2, DS 3, Sekiro (GOAT), and Elden Ring)Story: ?/10 Speaking as a Chinese person, you would really need to have some knowledge of the Journey to the West to understand the overall story of the game, or else it would seemed like a very disjointed narrative. The moment to moment plot is very great though, and the lore seemed to be very interesting. Having the opportunity to play as, as well as meeting and battling the many mythological heroes and monster are lit as hell, if I am to say.Exploration: 7/10 Lack of map, invisible walls where there should not be any, and fairly linear exploration did not help in this department. I was hoping for more puzzles or transversal challenge, since your character is a monkey after all.Graphics: 10/10 On all low settings, the game are still breathtaking. Just a pity I couldn't experience it fully.Gameplay: 10/10 What is there to say anymore, you're a monkey wielding a long stick, fighting with kungfu animals while using varied spells and transformation in a dance to the death. Top tier, all around.Voiceover and Music: 9/10If you are able to, playing the game using the Chinese dub would without a doubt elevate the experience. The OST are somber when it needed to, hype to the edge of your seat during crazy boss fights, and charming all around. You could see (or in this matter hear) the labor of love that have been poured into the game to make it not only a feast on the eye, but a delight to hear as well.Performance: 6/10My GTX1650 is screaming for mercy. All low is all I can managed to not be stuttering and stumbling from one crazy particles boss to another crazy particle boss."
Positive,"SunWuKong was born from rock, a life form born from a rock also can be known as ""Silicon-based life"" which made WuKong's ethnicity a minority. Since rock is also gender neutral which made WuKong a genderless being that also can be Pansexual a very classic LGBTQ representative as well. WuKong's is monk which made him a proud vegeterian too. In the novel ""Journey to the west"" WuKong did a lot of things such as made pact of sworn brother with Bull Demon King a character that is black which show WuKong support Black Character too. There's a time WuKong was furious that once he know monkey was being oppressed in underworld (afterlife place in chinese mythology) WuKong went there to punish the oppressor which support the ideology of Animal Rights Activist. Talk about ideology WuKong has the right idea as being a liberal due to his 500 years of being confine under Five Finger Mountain and because of that WuKong know the true value of what freedom should be. In latter of ""Journey to the west"" WuKong went through multiple hardship to put out the fire of Mountain of Flames which made WuKong a great Environmentalist. Lastly, WuKong respect women in general, whenever WuKong meet with female Bodhisattva WuKong will refer them respectably way equivalent to the modern ""Miss/Mistress"". There's also a country in the novel goes by the name ""女儿国"" basically Kingdom of Female, this country has a spring that allow males to pregnant once they drank it. This Kingdom only have female warrior and the males are the house-husband which empower the feminist agenda. WuKong has no problem with what's going on in Kingdom of Female which show him a very good believer of Feminist. Not to mention the his ability of transformation allow WuKong to transform into all kind of lifeform, animals, gender there's no difficulty at all. WuKong is a goat representative of the Woke Culture and we shall worship WuKong as our Monkey Lord.TLDR SunWuKong is a Minority, Pansexual, BLM, Feminist, Vegeterian, Animal Rights Activist, Environmentalist, Liberal and etc. 这是我从莫个Youtube评论拷贝过来的“孫悟空是石頭縫裏蹦出來的，是矽基生命，屬於少數族裔，它跟黑牛拜過兄弟說明它支持黑命貴，石猴是沒性別的，而且它既不近男色也不近女色，可以說是泛性戀，是典型的lgbt群體，再加上他出家人，所以也是一名素食主義者，他大鬧地府，避免了猴子猴孫們被地府迫害，是一名非常高尚的動物保護主義者，它被壓在五指山下五百年，受盡迫害，對自由有著更深的認知，因此也可以說他是一名自由主義者，他見到女性就喊女菩薩，尊重女性權益，是一名女權主義者，他為撲滅火焰山歷經艱險，是一名偉大的環保主義戰士，女兒國子母泉劇情有男性代孕、容許墮胎，更是爭取生育權益的進步體現，這樣一個集少數族裔、lgbt群體、素食主義、動物保護主義、女權主義、環保主義、自由主義等多重buff於一身的形象，算上他的七十二般變化更是爆發式的往身上套buff，居然還有人說他政治不正確 ？”"
Positive,"Hard to believe that this is the developer's first major work.This is all around a pretty great game, with very well telegraphed enemies and lots of fun to be had. While the game borrows quite a bit from the typical souls-like formula, it manages to distinguish itself enough to offer a unique experience. The game also has a way heavier focus on boss fights, more than you might expect. In fact, at times, it wouldn't be a stretch to call it a borderline boss-rush, as you can sometimes face one boss right after another with barely a minute in between. Theres also the visuals. Honestly, I'm not sure if this even needs to be said, but the overall visual presentation is unquestionably among the best in the medium, just make sure to turn off the god awful framegen. Despite that, the game somehow runs pretty well.Probably the most frustrating aspect of the game so far are invisible walls, which are quite plentiful, fairly disappointing considering i thought those kind of things were left in the PS3 era, but not a huge issue on its own. So far, theres not much else i dislike about the game.Overall, this is very good stuff, and easily worth the full price tag."
Positive,"It's nothing just pure art.From visuals to combat and gameplay, this game deserves all the awards, hopefully it will receive it's own GOTY title, as for now it is more than well deserved.I've waited this game for like ~3 years now, and i can say that is more than i expected, everything is astonishing, grab your own copy and enjoy the game, because it was made to be a good game, not a good product, but it fulfills both.Try to compare this game for 60$ with titles from ""big companies"" that claims their games as better than triple A and sell them for 70-80$.Great job for the whole team, Dev + QA, congrats and we hope to see more from you, it is a perfect start!"
Positive,"This game is fucking awesome. I’ve only played three chapters, but it’s already a solid 9/10. The only thing holding it back? The story’s a bit messy—seriously, can we get a clearer plot? But screw that, because everything else is on point. The combat is sharp, the mechanics are solid, and the boss fights? They’re fucking epic. You’ll feel like a god smashing the shit out of these massive dicks.And to all the dumbasses judging this game based on YouTube clips: shut the fuck up and play it. Black Myth: Wukong isn’t just some God of War rip-off—it’s addictive as hell and worth every damn penny.And don’t even try to compare it to Elden Ring. Those games are legends, but this one? It’s standing tall, swinging harder than a monkey with the biggest fucking dick around. If you want a game that’s made for gamers, not some YouTube-loving bullshit, this is it. Buy it, play it, and get ready to love every second."
Positive,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" has a good chance of being a GOTY 2024 contender due to its stunning visuals, engaging combat, and unique story based on Chinese mythology."

Positive,the best game of the year i have played so far.. Truly recommend! 10/10
Positive,Great experience and great game. Highly recommend.
Positive,"Reject humanity, embrace Monke"
Positive,"good art, bad boss fight, horrible maps"
Positive,"Firstful - not soulslike. More like first Darksiders or latets God of War games. Fun action slasher adventure. May be felt linear, but in different acts have different freedom and number of secrets. Love visual. Have no idea that's going on in story mainly because acts feels completely separated.Overall - good game."
Positive,"In the throes of battle, particularly against the formidable Wight, you may find yourself on the verge of sheer frustration, teetering on the edge as your keyboard nearly falls victim to your struggle. Yet, in this crucible of challenge, something remarkable happens. Your senses sharpen, your focus narrows, and you are lifted into a crescendo of precision and clarity. It's as if you ascend beyond the game's mechanics, reaching a heightened state of mental acuity where you begin to anticipate your opponent's every move with an almost preternatural insight.And it is at this moment, when you achieve this elevated consciousness, that the true essence of the game reveals itself. The game doesn't just start; it awakens, and so do you.10/10 Brainwash Free Game."
Positive,"This is one of the best single player games. The boss design is really good, there is more than 80 bosses and none of them is repeated. The final battle is awesome i never experience something like this, when the first time i played the final boss i was like wow, what, no way he cant do that.... Damn i missed this feeling in many games these days. After each chapter ends you can view a small cut scene each one has its own story and animation type it is really well done. The songs in chapter is really good. Over all this is 9/10 game. Only thing is if they have open world it would be so good. All the places and boss fights are screenshot worthy. In the middle of a boss fight i just pause and go to photo mode and take screenshots i never done that in many games."
Positive,REJECT MODERNITYEMBRACE MONKEEE
Positive,Stupid big bald blue baby took me an hour to beat
Positive,"I have spent 45 hours in Black Myth: Wukong and  currently in Chapter 5, I must say this game is nothing short of a masterpiece in the action RPG genre.From the relentless string of boss fights, many of which rival the difficulty and intensity found in ""Elden Ring,"" to the need for patience and learning enemy patterns, this game push me to their limits (Last time it was Elden ring lol). The sense of accomplishment you feel after finally conquering a tough boss is incredibly rewarding, and the in-game rewards feel well-deserved (material, armor and weapon etc).Hats off to the developers for crafting such a fantastic experience. While this game may not be for everyone due to its difficulty, it is definitely my pick for Game of the Year.Thank you, developers, for creating such a remarkable game!"
Positive,"Just wow...... Been waiting a loooooong time for this game, was getting worried about the hype meaning disappointment.... Well.... I was not. I tried Sekiro, I could not do it. Black Myth is just magical, the fact you have one difficulty is great, it just works like it was intended. I thought not having block would also be hard, to be honest, I am getting used to how the game wants you to play. Everything is just exciting from the get go and I am hooked already and determined to finish this journey.Beats any boring other game that is just always rubbish or the same. This is something new and fresh and is just fantastic.Great work from the game team!"
Positive,"A bunch of media criticized the ""lack of diversity"", but in fact no game is more diverseShame on you"
Positive,"Lacks diversity, need more purple haired Monke. 🐒"
Positive,Game has the best opening cinematic in video game.
Positive,l7wa m9wda ga chof ki dir wchriha bi3 klot ahmed hhh
Positive,"I’m completely blown away - this game is everything I’ve ever dreamed of and more.For me, it’s perfection in every sense; there’s not a single thing I’d change. Game Science’s passion and craftsmanship pour out of every detail, making the experience nothing short of breathtaking. Black Myth: Wukong, alongside Hollow Knight, stands as one of the only games I can wholeheartedly call a 10/10.Thank you, Game Science, for creating a truly unforgettable masterpiece."
Positive,10 hot monkey butts out of 10P.S. If your game still freezes and glitches check out your virtual memory. It should be allocated on SSD drive
Positive,"Absolute S-tier game!Let me start of by saying that gameplay-wise its closer to God of war or Devil may cry than a Souls game.Fast and snappy combat, amazing graphics and art style, the level design and overall vibe is top notch.If you love action combat or are even a tiny bit interested in discovering the chinese Journey to the west lore then I fully reccomend this game. Also last but not least the soundtrack SLAPS, whoever played the ""guitar"" in chapter 2 is an absolute G.The only minor gripes I have are the invisible walls and the experimental nature of chapter 6.I'm giving this game a GOTY/10 , no contest."
Positive,"I never bothered to write game reviews, but this game just blew my mind!There are almost a hundred unique boss fights without re-skin. Some of the boss fights are so stunning that they are my favorite boss fights of all time!Combat is both fluid and cinematic, with a wide range of choices such as stances, varied combos, transformations, spells, vessels and spirits. I am over 100 hours into the game and I still haven't tried everything out.While the game is as linear as Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, the game takes you to lush forest, windy deserts, snowfield, volcanoes etc, each with a breath-taking scenery. Invisible walls are definitely an immersion-breaker, but they become much less pronounced after Chapter 1 and do not significantly distract me from enjoying the game.If you like games such as God of War, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice etc, this is a game that you cannot afford to miss!"
Positive,"Having grown up watching Journey to the West since I was about three years old, it's safe to say that it played a significant role in my childhood. Thanks to Game Science, Black Myth: Wukong captures that magic perfectly. In fact, this game already has my vote for Game of the Year. Everything about it feels exceptional. The lore remains faithful to the original Journey to the West tale, though Baije's character has been slightly altered in a way that adds a fresh and positive twist.The combat is truly among the best I've experienced—precise, well-balanced, and challenging without ever feeling unfair. Visually, the game is stunning, with top-tier graphics and animation made possible by Unreal Engine 5. The soundtrack is both memorable and atmospheric, and the sound design feels incredibly lifelike.However, the game isn't without its shortcomings. Performance can sometimes be inconsistent, even on high-end systems, and invisible walls (which define the game's borders) can detract from immersion, popping up frequently. On rare occasions, you might even find yourself stuck in certain areas. Additionally, the story might be difficult to fully grasp for Western players who are unfamiliar with Chinese culture, Buddhism, or the Journey to the West narrative, requiring some research to fully appreciate the game's depth.Despite these minor flaws, I wholeheartedly recommend Black Myth: Wukong. It's an extraordinary experience that fans of the genre, and the story, shouldn't miss."
Positive,"Mark this: He's not just any monkey, He's a monkey of merit. A monkey was made Buddha once."
Positive,"Now after having played 83 hours and just done my first play-through, I would like to add some more personal views on this game.As a Chinese player I will start with the emotional cliches. Black Myth Wukong arrived in the summer holiday just like Journey To The West on the TV screen always accompanying us in our every summer vacation in the childhood. Initially I started playing this just to support the devs and our first ever home-grown triple A and check out the new story of Wukong after their journey to the west. I didn't skip any cut scenes and took my time to explore every corner of the map (more for the beautiful scenery). To me, this game is more like a piece of art and a great blend of Chinese traditional culture, Chinese mythology and religions (Chinese folk religion, Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, etc.). The temples, statues, murals etc. in the breath-taking scenery are directly built from the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The story is on par with the original Journey To The West, full of the suspense and deeply absorbing. In our childhood, we read and watch Wukong's Journey to the West and now I have the opportunity, as part of the story itself, to experience the 'Eighty-One Sufferings' (九九八十一难) and revive our great hero Wukong. I felt that I had completed my own journey to the west as well after finishing my first cycle - beating bosses, completing quests and experiencing the story as the destined one, as described in Buddhism, somehow may have slightly 'enlightened' / 'awakened' me. Aside from the fascinating story and gorgeous scenery, the game content is also very rich. Each chapter has its hidden quest which needs additional effort to explore to unlock and complete. They can be easily missed and the NG+ has very good playability, to make up the missed hidden quests in first cycle to unlock the true ending, or just to complete all 81 achievements (the eighty-one sufferings), or even to unlock the Great Sage Wukong form after completing 3 cycles (NG++). There are a great variety of yaoguais (monsters) in this game as well and each of them is very unique. There is also a story behind each one of them which you can read and I have always learned something after reading their stories, no matter if it's a sad one or a funny one. 81 unique bosses (yaoguai chiefs and kings) seems a lot in the beginning for me as a new player to souls like game. It's surely true as I spent half of the time in this game just to beat these bosses. But it didn't make me feel frustrated or bored. Some of them are really difficult but each one has their own set of moves which you can learn and get used to over time and I did feel bosses became easier over a few more trials. These difficult ones also encourage players to explore different strategies and approaches. Even for most difficult ones like Erlang, Yellow Loong, Yin Tiger, etc. I can find numerous different guides uploaded by other players on Bilibili.Overall I would say this game is worth every second I spent on it and I will definitely play more than a few cycles. Great thanks to Game Science and other teams who contributed to make Black Myth Wukong happen and made it another precious memory for the summer. Looking forward to the DLCs!>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Even though it's quite difficult for players like me who barely plays this type of games, it's still very addictive. 24 hours into the game I am still in the 2nd chapter, but the story line is fascinating and the fight has been enjoyable experience. Recommend to use a controller for best experience if you are a novice to this kind of games like me. Definitely the best purchase I have ever made in games."

Positive,I've never felt like a monke. But after playing this game i feel very monkey. Great game! I love dying every 2 minutes nothing in my life ever made me feel like i want to die even more :D
Positive,"Absolute masterpiece. Without spoilers, Chapter 3's Secret Area (the secret ending) is one of the coolest experiences I've ever had in video games and is a must-play imo. HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who loves combat, exploration, and wants to be immersed in an amazing and unique world"
Positive,"As a Chinese player, we have been expecting this moment for such a long period. There is no doubt it reached, or even over reached our expectation! Black Myth: Wukong can be the medium to popularise Chinese culture for players all over the world.  And we CN players are so so proud of this game! Well done Game Science!"

Positive,ข้อดีน่าจะมีคนพูดถึงเยอะแล้ว ขอมาพูดถึงข้อเสียที่เจอละกัน- เกมมีกำแพงล่องหน(illusion wall) มากเกินไป จนบางทีกำลังสู้อยู่แล้วหนีไปติดกำแพงทำให้เสียจังหวะโดยเฉพาะตอนสู้บอสรู้สึกหงุดหงิดมาก- มุมกล้องตอนสู้ เมื่อมีสิ่งกีดขวางอยู่ด้านหลังเรามันจะบังจนทำให้เรามองไม่เห็นอะไรเลย- ตัวละครเราตกเหวได้ แต่ไม่รู้ทำไมถึงไม่ใส่มาตั้งแต่แรก ๆ เพราะมันทำให้ผู้เล่นรู้สึกสับสนเท่าที่นึกออกมีประมาณนี้ แต่เกมดีคุ้มค่าราคาแน่นอนทั้งเกมเพลย์และเนื้อเรื่อง เพียงแต่ว่าถ้าคนที่ไม่ใช่แฟน ไซอิ๋ว อาจจะต้องอ่านเยอะนิดหน่อยถึงทำให้เข้าใจมากขึ้น : 8/10

Positive,"I've never been a big fan of soulslike games.Now I've tried wukong. And what can I say? It's love at first sight. wukong is simply great. It's great fun to fight your way through Chinese mythology as the monkey king with his pillar. It's epic! Thank you Game Science for not letting yourself be blackmailed. Exactly the right decision. Everyone wins, players and developers. Please make more of this!"
Positive,"I thought this was another boring soulslike game trying to copy FromSoftware's best games of the todays age, but glad i was wrong, this game is so good it deserves every praise!Sekiro is my favorite singleplayer game of all time and i thought there will never be an experience like it, until i tried Wukong...On top of next-gen visuals and interesting story, it has also very polished mechanics and gameplay is challenging in a fun way, which many modern games lack.IMPORTANT: Don't even try playing this game without an RTX card... In games like this, frames are very important!"
Positive,"GOTY!! Such immersive and impressive game,combat and all is just sick and feels good.. its an early review but i think game will only get better. 10/10 would recommend it, well freaking done devs.Edit: Finished the game today, since the moment i started playing it,it was just perfect, to the every last detail of it.

Positive,"A breathtaking action RPG that seamlessly blends Chinese mythology with thrilling gameplay. The visuals are striking, with detailed environments and vibrant effects that bring the mythological world to life. The soundtrack enhances the experience, with a blend of traditional and modern elements that perfectly matches the game’s tone."
Positive,"Okay, my opinion on Black myth Wukong. This game has EPIC intro at the beginning of the game. The game graphics are pretty good, combat skills are repetative unless you unlock most of the skill tree. The world ( mountains and forests ) have barriers so not a free roaming game. The game is challenging like Sekiro but not hard as Sekiro. There is a character in every cornor of the world, No side missions, no outposts just move straight and face a legendary characters. NPC's are less to farm XP and all the juice of the games are within the Boss battles. Lets explore more to see what it holds on further walkthrough.--- 7.7/10 --- Cause I really suck at challenging games."
Positive,Best graphics I've ever played in a game  also the story is great if you read or watch the TV show of Journey to the West beforehand. love the game
Positive,"Very fun game also very difficult, prepare to suffer."
Positive,"monke hungry, monke grab"
Positive,"For sure recommend this game. The game have a bit of performance issue, but very little in compare with other quadruple A garbage coming from Ubisoft. Get the game and support the company they well."
Positive,"First, let's talk about the areas for improvement: In the map, there are places that I feel can be explored but actually cannot, they are merely there as a part of the scene's completeness, just as a texture.Now, let's discuss what impressed me: First and foremost is the combat, which is the most abundant in the game, and it feels incredibly satisfying to me, with a very strong sense of impact. Especially the quadruple charge and slash. The slow motion given by the stun, dodge, and the timing of the instant kill is a significant positive feedback, indicating that this operation is very good. Each boss has a distinct characteristic, making the battles never dull, with a special mention to Yang Jian, even after fighting him dozens of times, I still thoroughly enjoy the battle with him.Secondly, the sound effects. For me, my pursuit of sound effects might even surpass my appreciation for visuals. The stun sound effects, the quadruple charge sound effects, the sound of weapons hitting the Yellow Browed Monster, the sound of the Copper Head and Iron Arm spinning, the sound of the Ruyi Jingu Bang appearing, and so on, all make me feel as if celestial music is echoing in my ears, based on my extremely high experience. The game's music is also top-notch, with each scene's background music fitting perfectly, leaving a deep impression on me, especially the music during the Yellow Browed Battle and the rowing before the Great Sage's remains.Lastly, the visuals, which might actually be the most outstanding aspect of this work. The entire game scene is designed exceptionally well, with Turtle Island, the Pagoda of the Buddha's Bone, Mei Mountain, Zhaojian Lake, the Great Sage's memory of the sunset, and even the interaction with falling leaves. Even if it's just for the scenery, this is an extremely excellent work.In summary, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" holds a very high position in my heart, and I consider it a very excellent piece of art."
Positive,"Re-released reviewThis review is obviously re-written. I suppose most of previous issue I had is resolved.I was playing on my laptop on SOLAR CHARGED lithium batteries in wintry conditions.The VOLTAGE was dropping fast, the longer i PLAYED...my conditions have improved. Game is working better.My problem wasn't my desktop's it's my laptop.What happened supposedly as the night progresses normally, & YOU PLAY, the voltage from the batteries does decrease.As that happens so, with SETTINGS ON ABSOLUTE HIGHEST (CINEMATIC with red warnings DLSS with FG on), even though it was possible to play for many hours like this. I suppose over time and many hours of playing I had the following problematic issues;-JARRING STUTTERING, terrible, (the VOLTAGE decreased during long hours of play the game was affected-being such a big layout)Back to the game;-one of the things I like about the game is that when you get taken OUT, you don't lose any XP.-the game is great to look at.-even though it seems linear there's many a hidden item in this game...the 128GIG installation size,Remember it's a big game.-at time of writing the review...i have recently DEFEATED ERLANG SHEN....Here for you, my favorite XP farm, I use the SHRINE at The New West Thunderclap Mountain Temple, fighting the monks, and any and all around there...ONE PASS there usually guarantees me 1 Spark,additionally, using the correct curios & clothing increasing the rates of drops, MIND CORE are usually plentiful here too.-I haven't suffered many crashes really.DLC is 99% confirmed definitely looking forward to that.RECOMMENDED"
Positive,"been anticipating this game forever, big fan of SWK , always looking forward for him to appear on games i play, from league, to mobile games, now this.. this is gold... good satisfying combat, only downside i see is NO MAP but still nice game! 100/10 ! hopefully they get more interesting games in the future!"
Positive,"I'd say I had bias at the beginning as I thought some of the videos were too good to be true and many reviewers criticized the exploration and the map design before the game launched to the public. After finishing the first two chapters of the game, I know I have to leave a comment for this unbelievable game. The combat is incredible with tons of freedom and creativity. By using different strategies, I can play the monkey in a soul-like way or a god of war way (I feel the designers would encourage us to fight instead of dodging though). The story is also amazing and I really enjoy watching the CG and animation and reading the tales. Ok, Let's go back to the exploration and map design, as I said I began with bias and thought this would be bad. In chapt 1 I would say the map is too straightforward for me and I was thinking ok it was like this, not much exploration I guess (there were some hidden yaoguai kings but it was not hard for me to find them). In the next map, things are totally different, huge map and multilayer villages (if such a description is correct). This gave me lots of fun to explore. And I understand that people may complain that there is no obvious guideline and we may get lost. But I want to say just keep moving forward and exploring whatever you want, and once you are standing in front of the final boss, you will see how all roads lead to Rome. I wonder if this is the philosophy we can get from JttW and I guess I would love to read the book then. I still cannot believe this is a game developed by a company that only had 200 employees. Cannot imagine how many efforts you guys have made to make this masterpiece possible. Best game of 2024 so far for me."

Positive,"“Black Myth: Wukong” is a groundbreaking experience that has set a new standard for action RPGs. From the moment you start, it becomes evident that this game is a labor of love, meticulously crafted to immerse players in a world that is both visually stunning and narratively rich.The game's visuals are nothing short of breathtaking. Every environment, from lush forests to desolate mountains, is rendered with an attention to detail that feels almost lifelike. The character models, especially the protagonist Wukong, are intricately designed, showcasing an impressive range of animations that bring every battle to life. The dynamic weather systems and realistic lighting further enhance the atmosphere, making the world feel alive and constantly evolving.But it's not just about looks—Black Myth: Wukong delivers on gameplay in spades. The combat system is fluid and challenging, requiring players to master a variety of abilities and transformations to overcome powerful foes. The influence of Chinese mythology is woven deeply into the game mechanics, offering a fresh and unique experience that stands out in a genre often dominated by Western fantasy tropes. The variety of enemies, each with their own distinct behaviors and attack patterns, keeps the gameplay engaging and rewarding.The narrative is another highlight. The story, inspired by the classic tale of Journey to the West, is filled with depth, mystery, and emotion. It’s not just a retelling of an ancient legend; it’s a reimagining that adds layers of complexity to the characters and their motivations. Wukong’s journey is not just one of physical prowess but of self-discovery and redemption, making it easy for players to become emotionally invested in his fate.Sound design and music also play a crucial role in creating the game’s immersive atmosphere. The soundtrack blends traditional Chinese instruments with modern orchestral compositions, perfectly matching the game’s tone and setting. Meanwhile, the sound effects—whether it’s the clash of weapons, the roar of mythical beasts, or the ambient sounds of nature—are meticulously crafted to draw players deeper into the world.In summary,Black Myth: Wukong is more than just a game; it’s an experience that showcases the pinnacle of what modern gaming can achieve. It’s a perfect blend of stunning visuals, compelling storytelling, and challenging gameplay, all wrapped in a package that honors its cultural roots while pushing the boundaries of the genre. Whether you’re a fan of action RPGs or simply someone who appreciates finely crafted video games, Black Myth: Wukong is a must-play that will leave a lasting impression. This is not just a game; it’s a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come."""
Positive,So far loving the gameplay and storyline. It's very enjoyable. High Recommended if someone is looking for something interesting.
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong------------------------------------------------Been a fan of Journey to the West since I read it, so I was excited to dive into Black Myth: WuKong.First off, let me say, this game looks fantastic. The environments are absolutely stunning, with some of the best level design I've seen in a long time. It captures the mythical Chinese landscapes beautifully, and every area feels meticulously crafted. Some of the scenery just had me stopping in my tracks. The game's design is just on another level.The soundtrack? Pure gold. It fits the world and the mythical vibe perfectly. Each track seems to amplify the experience, making the boss fights more intense and the exploration more immersive.But the gameplay... that's where things get a bit tricky. The combat is fun, but it can feel a bit floaty at times. There's impact, but something feels off. It's not as tight as you'd want, which leaves the experience less satisfying during some of the tougher battles. Speaking of battles, there are a lot of bosses. Some of them are absolute highlights, with incredible design and challenge, but others? They kind of miss the mark and feel a bit repetitive.The story is another area that might trip people up. It draws heavily from Journey to the West, which, for me, was great because I've read it. But I can imagine that for those unfamiliar with the book, it can feel confusing and disjointed at times. There are moments that seem to assume you already know some of the lore, which might leave others scratching their heads. Thankfully, knowing the story helped me keep track of what was happening, but I can see how others might struggle with it.Overall, Black Myth: Wu Kong is a visual masterpiece with a great soundtrack and brilliant level design. But it stumbles a bit when it comes to gameplay, and the story could be clearer for those who haven't read the source material. Still, if you're a fan of the mythos like I am, there's plenty to love here.So, get ready to journey with the monkey – just know that not everything's as polished as it looks!enjoy WUKONG !!!"

Positive,BEST GAME MADE IN CHINA 10/10
Positive,"This is my first game review ever.Personally, I find it to be an excellent game and highly recommend it to friends. After investing a total of 7X7=49 hours, I have finally met the conditions to unlock so-far all endings. Reflecting on this time, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute and every second, regardless of whether I was able to defeat the boss or the nature of the narrative content I encountered. Of course, I particularly look forward to seeing a more expansive or even revolutionary breaking-free-from-the-confines-of-Samsara narrative in potential future DLCs or other installments in the series.The game is imbued with an immense amount of beauty that is unique to local culture, a profound romanticism inherent to our heritage, and elements of philosophical thought integrating Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. The content and details of this game are not something that many people can fully comprehend and absorb, and cannot be quickly grasped in a fast-food, superficial manner. It could be the same even to many contemporary local individuals, including myself, who have received predominantly Western science-and-technology-focused education with only a certain amount of exposure to the local and traditional classics, arts, and humanities. Drawing a parallel with language learning, the understanding and learning costs associated with different cultures vary significantly. Therefore, when we see low ratings or negative reviews, to some extent, it is inevitable. After all, these ratings and feedback could be based on the limited or even complete lack of understanding of a culture with a profound and continuous historical background. Whether the reviewers are merely playing the game casually, their lack of understanding of the cultural core, narrative structure, and the deeper meanings within the dialogues leads to evaluations based solely on their gameplay experiences, such as defeating bosses and achieving victories without understanding the meaning of the dialog/background story; or some other reasons you may or may not know. Regarding these reviews, there is no point in arguing. Individuals are at various stages of understanding the way of meaning, and acquiring knowledge in any field involves a learning curve. Just like an old saying from a story from <The Record of Pointing at the Moon, Vol. 28>: Firstly, to perceive the game as simply a game; then, to recognize that the game is not merely a game; and finally, to understand that the game is indeed the game.It must be aware that classical culture requires outstanding contemporary works to bridge cultural gaps and foster global-and-glocal understanding. I genuinely hope that our local game developers can produce more and better works for the world, as our predecessors have achieved much more challenging feats. Certainly, regarding the Game Science firm itself, I look forward to DLCs related to our beloved Wukong and new installments in this series. This game is truly remarkable."
Positive,Monkey with stick.
Positive,"I'm having so much fun with this game, the combat and exploration are REALLY good."
Positive,"This is an example of a PROPER AAA video game, worth every penny of it's price of admission. And WE, the players, NEED to show our support of AAA Developers like this, because the current model used by EA, Ubisoft, Blizzard, etc..etc.. is POOP! ""Why?"" Well I'll tell you:Black Myth: Wukong =1) NO MICRO TRANSACTIONS! (who would've imagined!?)2) NO Day-1 Paid Extras3) NOT a Vehicle to SELL players DLC's (""It's an actual game designed to be REPLAYED!?"" YES!!!!)And, it's made on UE5, has INSANE visuals, cool Chinese Lore, AWESOME Boss-fights, is FUN ASF, and it's got a bo-staff-wielding-kung-fu-fighting-Monkey-KING!!!"
Positive,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" is not just an action-adventure game, but also a profound reinterpretation and expression of Chinese culture and mythology.The game's visuals are breathtaking. Every scene, every blade of grass is filled with intricate details. Whether it’s the lighting effects or texture quality, everything is executed with an exceptional level of craftsmanship. The development team has seamlessly blended ancient Chinese landscapes with the fantastical elements of mythology, creating a world that feels both familiar and refreshingly new.The combat system is incredibly deep, with each move designed to be extremely fluid and impactful.The enemy designs are also highly creative, with everything from ordinary demons to massive boss battles offering challenges that require both strategy and skill.In terms of story, the game faithfully recreates classic episodes from ""Journey to the West,"" while also incorporating a wealth of original content. Wukong’s journey is not just an adventure but a spiritual quest, with many dialogues and story elements that provoke deep thought.The music and sound effects are another highlight, with each piece of music perfectly setting the mood, from intense battles to peaceful villages, fully immersing you in the game’s atmosphere."
Positive,"I've never been so impressed by a game before and I've only beaten the first chapter which took me around 3.5 Hours with minimal sight seeing. Production value is otherworldly. Played the entirety of the souls franchise , and Nioh 2 is my favorite game of all time. Here's some of its strong points.- Holy shit the introduction sequence. If you've never seen gameplay, don't ruin it for yourself. You'll want to experience it firsthand.- The game doesnt focus on an uphill battle to reach bosses and the bosses are where the majority of effort was placed, which is how it should be. If you've played the souls series you might have been beaten into submission and forced to think that going back to the boss should be a miserable experience, but it shouldnt be and this game reflects it.- Bosses have incredibly dynamic and cinematic attack patterns, additionally the game has perfect dodges and rewards you for doing so. Not only with resource generation but also makes the combat that much cooler with the visual effects. Well played boss fights make you feel like a god.- The attacks / gameplay loop feels clunky at first but within the first 30min youll realize that you can gain the ability to continue a light attack chain even if you've dodged. this is important because the last attack of that combo chain is the only free move that can produce stagger. Whole system is extremely fluid, but youll be thinking at first if its just a 1 button game, it's not. It's just trying to ease you into it so don't worry.- Baked in , out of the gates, unlimited respecs with no punishment for build creativity. Sounds crazy how easy of a W this is and how long its taken a studio to deliver.- Game is absolutely stunning. Only other game that i can compare that has that 'wow factor' of visual fidelity is the Demon Souls remake, if you know you know.- I usually skip cinematics because i cba, but for Wukong i've sat through every one grinning. All in all i thought this level of production was dead in games. Very very very happy to see this game finally release and its not a pile of shit. Worth picking up at full price."
Positive,10/10 more like god of war then elden ring
Positive,"This game became one of my favourites of all time, I'm so happy it's getting the appreciation it deserves and peaked 2.2 million players. It's truly unique, ignore whatever these journalists are saying about the game's diversity because its shown that no one cares. The game is based on a Chinese Fantasy Novel, 1592 'Journey To The West', 'diversity' shouldn't matter. These people are so brainrot.But to talk about the actual game, it's a masterpiece to say the least. The bosses are so fun and unique, all have such cool animations and special designs. The cutscenes and intros to the bosses are phenomenal. The skills and mechanics in this game are so amazing and haven't seen in other games before. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous, everything in this game is literally just unique, no other words to explain. The genre is a mix between a few, I'd say action, souls-like and RPG. Personally I haven't had any performance issues and I would say this is really well optimized.Game Science really outdid themselves on their first big game like this, and if this is how their first game is then I can't wait to see what they have in store for us in the future. But let's not think about the future and enjoy this masterpiece for now as it's not everyday you see a gem like this come out."
Positive,"This game was worth the wait. Personally, I love the myth of WuKong and this game made it possible for you to immerse yourself within the myth. The performance of the game is perfectly fine, I have a 3080 and a ryzen 9 5900X with the in-game setting of very high on everything except for the ray tracing. If you still think that this is poor performance then just don't get the game or wait until you can get a better rig. The combat is super rewarding with you use the correct skill in combination with the light and heavy attack. There's no map in the game but it only makes the world exploration more rewarding. Game science did not do us dirty and they were indeed cooking for the past three years. This game is a reminder that it is possible for studios to make good games that only focuses on the game."

Positive,"I haven't finished the game yet, but I think I should already leave a review, given how much it surprised me. Years ago when I first saw it, I thought it was just another scam used to farm money and never see the light of day...Chinese Mythology: I won't go into detail about how Chinese mythology fits into the game, as I only knew a few names and figures, so I'm not qualified to give a proper appraisal.Difficulty: I've noticed that some people are having trouble with certain bosses, but I don't think it's on the level of ""Malenia"". There are definitely some tougher bosses, but I imagine that's because the people haven't adapted during the fight. The game is pretty well-balanced in terms of difficulty, and with the amount of stance breaking you can chain together with various builds, it's possible to finish several bosses without even seeing an attack from them. In those other bosses where it's harder to land a combo like that, the learning curve comes into play, which is brief and with minor frustrations. I haven't seen a boss yet that required a lot of time to finish.One detail I should also mention is that Unreal Engine 5 truly impressed me. The game impresses with its stunning graphics, bringing Chinese mythology to life with a level of detail rarely seen in games. The animations are fluid, and the landscapes are so rich that each scene feels like a work of art in itself.The game offers many ways to build your simian: combat stances, magic, transformations, potions, varied combos, and a very enjoyable dodge system (which comes close to Sekiro's parry system). The variety of enemies per chapter might be considered low by some, but for me, there are enough and they're quite varied, with some being quite frustrating. However, this leads me to one of the aspects I like most: the bosses. I feel like every 20 minutes of exploration, we're rewarded with unique bosses, with spectacular art design, dynamic and well-constructed combat, a well-fitting atmosphere, and a soundtrack that deserves to be highly appreciated. I loved the seamless transitions between cutscenes and gameplay, which provides a very cinematic experience. I feel like this was missing between some chapters, but it's forgivable.There's a lot I could talk about, but that would take a long time, and since I'm ""braindead"" as you can see from the little I've mentioned above, I'll just highlight a few points.Negative points:- Invisible walls: It's quite frustrating when you think you can access a place but an invisible wall prevents you.- Soundtrack during exploration: The OST is spectacular as I mentioned before, but there are moments when you're exploring and don't feel like the music fits the gameplay.- Camera in some bosses: Some large or flying bosses can sometimes be hard to see, making it difficult to react during combat.Positive points:-Builds: The immense variety for building your monkey and the lack of hassle/cost for resetting the skill tree.- Graphics: If you have any criticism about the graphics, you're crazy.- Optimization: Running on ultra with stable 120 FPS (I locked it) without problems.- Soundtrack and sounds: Yes, I also included this as a negative point. The game is so good that I had to hunt for any inconvenience to list as negative...- Characters: The character design is absurdly good. Sometimes I go to the painted realm just to stare at Xu Dog.- Story: So far, the adventure has been very good to follow, and I'm excited to see how it will unfold in the end.For me, ""Black Myth Wukong"" will easily be the ""GOTY"" of this year. In my opinion, ""Game Science"" joins the list of the best DEVs, and I can say that I'm looking forward to more games from them. I also hope that China invests more in this single-player market."
Positive,It's crazy to play a feature complete video game in 2024
Positive,return to monke
Positive,"What a pleasant surprise of a game.Probably best described as a better version of the recent GOW games with some small semblance to Souls games.Top tier quality production with no major bugs at least for my play through. It looks amazing on the highest settings with full Ray tracing, tho very demanding, however the performance is pretty good and scales well at lower settings.Most of the game is a power fantasy where you are way stronger than the bosses and it feels great, however it does have one optional boss that is a real contender for being one of the best bosses in gaming, that fight does make you work a bit to win.Story is definitely going to go over most people's heads, you do have to think about it and try to understand what characters are really doing and why. Not for those that want to be feed all the story without any effort to understand it.Only meaningful downside is the huge amount of invisible walls in places that seem like you should be able to go to.Were it not for Shadow of the Erdtree even being ""Just a DLC"", this would be my pick for GOTY."

Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is not just a game, it is a unique adventure that you won't soon forget. With absolutely gorgeous graphics and silent hero whose actions speak volumes, the journey to enlightenment is rewarding, thrilling, and entertaining. The core strength of this game lies in its genuinely outstanding boss battles, each one a unique and challenging experience. Trust me, they are absolutely fantastic. While the journey to those moments might not be impeccable, the experience is well worth it."
Positive,"This is going to get the ""Favorite game you suck at"" award this year for the steam awards for me haha.Masterpiece. ""It just works""~Tod Howard.. (But it's actually true with this game.)Monkey is the way.I'm sure I missed so much stuff, as I went into this one blind. I did eventually just check to see if it had new game+ and it does, so I'm going to continue my blind play through and then just go hunting next time around. I feel OP against some trash mobs, and then the game puts a head band on me for the bosses. (If you know you know) I'm in a mountain, then I'm free then I'm in the mountain. It's great. I even started watching all the Journey to the west stuff on youtube. (and Amazon and other places.) When China shows more freedom than the U.S. = Black Myth: WuKong10/10 would take on the gods and demons again."
Positive,"This game is deserving of GOTY but I don't think its my GOTY just yet. I think the comparisons to GOW 2018/Ragnarok and Jedi Fallen Order/Survivors are fair but to me, this game sets out to be MORE of a spectacle with crazy cinematics since Asura's Wrath and any of its comparisons. They gave Rakshasa, the four heavenly kings and Erlang Shen, the most coolest portrayals I had ever seen.I do have some minor complaints, like how player collision works on certain enemies that causes you to be push out of range and completely whiff an attack. There's two bosses that were mildly infuriating to fight against, simply because of this factor, and it doesn't help when these two would either be out of the boss arena or runs away for you to do anything. But the highs that this game sets out, sets out high.If you are a fan of Journey to the West, then you must be familiar with how many depictions and retelling there are. For me, my first exposure was the 1986 Chinese show, but I can safely say that this game's version of JTTW is chef kisses. The high attention to detail on ancient Chinese monasteries, the hand-drawn animations and stop motion, the OST, there is so much to love about, of course there will be people calling this GOTY."

Positive,This game is art. Masterpiece. So much fun.
Positive,"I've played for about 5 hours now, and I enjoy the game. I don't understand gamer debates over single player games, it's like everyone is so desperate for everyone else to like or dislike the things they do. It's a good game, buy it, or don't, but it is a fun game utilizing what we can expect from UE5 and solid and challenging combat. I'd give it an 8/10 on my end, but that's probably just because I have brain damage from open world games being EVERY release these days. There is something nice about linear old school movement like I am on my Gamecube or PS2 all over again. Anyways, I say give it a shot!"
Positive,"I received this game as a promo for my 4070 Super purchase. Within an hour of playing the game i did upgrade to the deluxe edition.The visuals and atmosphere of the world are mesmerizing, From fighting up in the clouds to strolling along a forest taking in all the sights. The mechanics are reminiscent of Darksouls and Jedi Fallen order, from what little time i have spent in the world i can tell they really nailed it on bringing it all together. The combat is satisfying once you begin to get the hang of combos, dodges and spells synergizing fluently. Now granted i am not the best at these types of games i still find it an extremely enjoyable experience, and looking forward to diving deeper into the world."

Positive,"Congrats to the devs, for their first try this is an achievement. UE5 will always be a problem even on higher hardware( XTX and 5800x3D) but it is what it is.From what I can see this is a Souls lite so don't compare it with ER.The skill tree is humongous so as an RPG fan that is a plus.1.3M concurrent players in the first hour ... that is a win in my book.PS:  NO ""Diversity"" needed!"
Positive,"8/10 Game is really solid so far. A lot of Souls-mechanics without the punishment that comes along with it. So far, bosses have been fun to beat. Story is somewhat easy to follow given the amount of lore they provide. Love the skill tree respec available at any time, allowing for strategy changes for different bosses. Overall, a pretty solid game!Some issues that I have with this game:1) Invisible walls - invisible walls are very frustrating because it gives you a feeling that you have a big area to explore, only to be frustrated when you hit the wall. For crying out loud, there's even ledges that have invisible walls, only to find out later that you can explore the lower area! Either provide a skill that reduces fall damage, or design the map so that it actually shows the boundary of the area.2) Graphical issues - 3070Ti is suffering with FSR, Very High Graphics. You can literally lose a boss fight from stuttering and frame drops.3) Traversal - map traversal is so boring. Like, you have a monkey... that won't even swing around. I'm currently at chapter 3 and there doesn't seem to be any hint of that mechanic in the game. Even Jump doesn't have much use outside of combat, and when you do use it, it's so janky, and also, links back to the invisible walls issue. Sure, there's bits where you can transform into something, but it's not as fun as vine swinging (or web swinging as Spidey).4) UI Design - generally, the UI is pretty solid. My issue is the item ""wheel"". There are drink names that doesn't align against their intended effect. You would think ""Evil Repelling Drink"" is some kind of holy negation drink right? WRONG! It's Physical Damage Negation buff! So... I hope they fix this by adding icons of the drink effect in the item wheel."

Positive,cold ass intro
Positive,"I recently had the pleasure of playing Black Myth Wukong, and I must say that it is truly a masterpiece. The game is a return to form for the action-adventure genre, with its fast-paced combat, intricate puzzles, and beautiful open world. I am grateful to the developers, Game Science, for bringing us such a high-quality game.One of the things that sets Black Myth Wukong apart from other games is its commitment to its vision. The game does not bend to the ""woke agenda"" as many other recent titles have in past years. Instead, it stays true to its roots and delivers an experience that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. The performance of Black Myth Wukong is also top-notch. Even on an older system, the game runs smoothly and looks stunning. I was able to run the game on max settings with no issues, which is a testament to the optimization work done by the developers.I will easily put 1000+ hours into this game. The world of Black Myth Wukong is so rich and detailed that I find myself lost in it for several hours at a time. The combat is also incredibly satisfying, with a wide range of weapons and abilities to choose from.In conclusion, Black Myth Wukong is a must-play for any fan of action-adventure games. It is a return to form for the genre, and a shining example of what games can be when developers are allowed to focus on creating a great experience, rather than pandering to a political agenda. I highly recommend checking it out on Steam.444"

Positive,"Witnessing single-player game like Wukong massively succeeding , while Concord miserably failing in the same week is peak satisfaction. Pulling the support on suicide squad was the icing on top, in this incredible gaming week. My faith is restored in my fellow gamers. Ape together Strong"
Positive,"The obvious souls-like references aside, something this game does that i find quite interesting; Boss fights in this game play out more like a traditional arcade fighting game, like Tekken.Bosses moves have more mixups and they tend to try and bait/trick you into trying to punish a lot of times. The moves also can be chained from their various moveset making combos you really do not anticipate. There are very few ""combo ender"" moves where you are guranteed a safe punish so most times you'll need to poke with some risks or go for a combo with major risks.As an example the Black Bear Guai, the final boss of chapter 1, has a few generic attacks that he can do such as combo A of 1-2-3 or or combo B of  1-2. At times he could use less than the combo's full string (such as combo A 1-2 but no 3). That's typical of Soulslike. However, at times, you would see something like combo A 1-2 into combo B 1-2. Another mixup of combo A 1-2-3 - pause into combo ender X (Body slam) to punish people who like to poke (You can still dodge it if your reflexes are fast enough).Sometimes there would even be combo B 1 - pause and then into combo A 1-2 - pause again to throw off the rhythm.Very rarely, the boss would spam a chain of attacks such as combo A 1-2-3 into combo B 1-2 into combo ender Y (double hand slam).It's nice to see a pretty innovative take on the soulslike fighting style as well as emphasis on boss fights as opposed to exploration/common enemies."

Positive,"As someone who grew up loving Journey to the West - both the book and the animated series I watched as a kid - I was beyond hyped for Wu Kong. The story of the Monkey King has always fascinated me (and yes, I unironically stan Zhu Bajie), so when this game was announced, it went straight into my library as a preorder. I didn’t have sky-high expectations, but Wu Kong absolutely delivers.The visuals are gorgeous, the art direction is brilliant, and the writing holds up nicely. The game's creativity is quite unhinged at times, making for an unpredictable and exciting experience. The boss fights are memorable and offer a reasonable challenge. Make no mistake - this is NOT a Soulslike. While it borrows certain elements from Miyazaki's games, Wu Kong stays true to the action-adventure formula, leaning more toward the style of DMC and God of War. So set your expectations accordingly.There are a few rough edges, most notably the invisible walls here and there, but none of that took away from my enjoyment. The charm, atmosphere, and sheer fun of Wu Kong easily make up for any shortcomings.Wu Kong slaps—both literally and figuratively. It's hands-down one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I’ve had this year."

Positive,"Game's good.Hitboxes are wonky (think Dark Souls 2, but even worse, you'll be smacking their chest with your matchstick but since it's not the intended foot or limb, NOPE, no damage, but it does damage when they're knocked down, lol), dodging is wonky, after getting into ng+ the combat is incredibly repetitive and it's a bit jank. You may not even realize it, but the combat is not nearly as tight as something like Elden Ring, and it's so floaty. Only 3 difficult bosses in the game, 2 are early on, the 3rd and most difficult is a secret (best boss, funnest, most epic, they needed more bosses like them). I thought it was too difficult at first, it's actually a bit too easy after nearly completing all achievement (missed another missable in ng+, don't feel like doing another ng++ cycle and farming for soaks). I actually like the english dub more than the chinese voice acting, surprisingly. Graphics are pretty, but it has some serious stuttering issues, and cut scenes for some reason just tank in FPS on my PC, I tried playing with settings, googling, nvidia control panel, etc. to no avail, it has a serious need of performance patches. AND NO HDR!!! Unacceptable for me. I have an OLED monitor, HDR is essential. I can't believe such a large release doesn't have such a standard feature. The game would look SOOO much better for it. Also there's several bugs where you miss content because of beating the final boss of the secret areas, so on the safe side don't think you can go back when you should be able to. The level design is kind of a mixed bag, like a very big mixed bag. I enjoyed the first 3/4 the most, while the remaining was kind of, eh. It was big and empty, though you could argue the same for previous chapters, I excuse it based on how you'd find a boss here, or there, and some goodies to help you get stronger. There was something there.The invisible walls. Inexcusable, don't know what the f they were thinking with this. Horrible decision, just awful, AWFUL. Know how you kill immersion within seconds? You can't even jump off a damn bridge. So many weird invisible walls where it's like, just let us go there? Who cares if there's nothing? The story is a fragmented mess, straight up, unless you know everything about Journey To The West and can piece things together yourself because this is a story using it. It makes sense and becomes coherent somewhere 3/4 of the way through for those uninitiated, where it becomes more than a generic GET THE RELICS/ARTIFACTS NOBODY, AND BECOME THE HERO! After reading all the lore entries and getting true ending, it's pretty good. I like what they did.I give it an 8.5/10, may be a bit too high given the many glaring faults I listed, a 6.5/7 would probably be more accurate and objective, but the setting, the lore/mythos, and what I personally look for in a game it does for me. I wanted to be in the world and I felt immersed. I was thinking about playing it when I wasn't playing it, and when working have someone playing it on a side monitor (streamer)."
Positive,Can't believe the studios previous works were mobile games. Something to learn for AAA game studios..
Positive,"every time you try countless times and defeat a boss. That feeling is really great. Ofc, this is also the life. Nothing can be done in one go."

Positive,"I am M O N K EA P E S T O G E T H E R S T R O N GA measured and well-defined experience with a lot of character, masquerading as a game. Can't complain about anything except some random frame drops, which the developers should patch out soon enough."
Positive,"just a good game. I liked some aspects, some not so much... but at least they didn’t put an open world here for 100 hours, and thank you for that :)"
Positive,"After beating two mini-bosses and the White Wolf, I can confidently say that Black Myth: Wukong has far exceeded my already sky-high expectations. The gameplay is exceptionally smooth, with combat mechanics that, while not exactly Souls-like, offer a satisfying challenge. The learning curve for perfect dodges, enemy attack patterns, and different enemy types keeps you engaged, and the gorgeous, non-open-world level design, paired with a soothing soundtrack, adds to the immersive experience.While some features like a proper full-screen mode are still absent, the overall gameplay is so well-executed that these minor issues are easy to overlook. This game has Game of the Year potential, and it's a shame that Western gaming press might not have given it the recognition it deserves. I'm thrilled to play a game that doesn't require me to switch language settings, though I acknowledge that some of the story elements and cultural nuances might be tough to grasp without prior knowledge of Journey to the West. Even so, this depth adds to the game's mystery and replayability, as there's always something new to discover.If you get stuck on any obscure content, feel free to leave a comment—I’ll do my best to help you out. Sharing and understanding these details together is part of what makes gaming so enjoyable.I sincerely hope Black Myth: Wukong becomes the huge success it deserves to be. Happy exploring!"
Positive,Makes AAA Western games look like Chinese knockoffs
Positive,It reminded me of times when I played with my monke brothers before evolution became mainstream. Great game
Positive,Do it for harambe
Positive,WE GO MONKEE
Positive,"Amazing game in every aspect. It delivers breathtaking combat, stunning production quality, and unforgettable boss fights. Very fun to play, linear and semi-open world regions with a lots of exploration, secrets and enemies. The story is inspired by the classic Journey to the West novel. Totally recommended if you're into something between God of War 2018 & Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. A must-play 10/10"
Positive,my pc physically cannot run this game but i know its gonna be fuckin epic when i can in like 2 years
Positive,Hanuman Ji is great! 10/10
Positive,"i7-12700 and 4070. The game runs perfectly, not stuttering or other performance issues. Very fun so far, bosses are challenging but not crazy hard aside from one. Very impressed with this game. Graphics, performance, story, combat, better than most triple A titles that have come out in recent years."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is, at first glance, a stunning reimagining of the classic Chinese epic ""Journey to the West."" With its breathtaking visuals and meticulously crafted world, the game promises an epic adventure filled with mythical creatures, intense battles, and rich lore. But beneath this veneer of traditional storytelling lies a deeply resonant narrative that delves into the complexities of identity, gender, and sexuality in ways that are both unexpected and profoundly moving.At the heart of Black Myth: Wukong is Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, whose journey is not just one of physical transformation but of inner turmoil and self-discovery. The game masterfully portrays Wukong’s struggle with his gender and sexuality, making his story one of the most compelling and emotionally charged narratives in gaming. This isn’t just a tale of a hero battling external foes; it is a deeply personal exploration of identity, where the true conflict lies within.Wukong’s journey is marked by a powerful inner conflict as he grapples with questions of who he is and who he is meant to be. The developers have crafted a narrative that doesn’t shy away from the complexities of these issues. Wukong’s transformations throughout the game are not just physical but symbolic of his evolving understanding of his own identity. Each form he takes is a reflection of his inner struggle, representing different facets of his gender and sexuality, and the game deftly explores these themes with a sensitivity and depth that is rarely seen in this medium.The portrayal of Wukong’s internal battle is nothing short of revolutionary. The game delves into the fluidity of gender, the confusion of self-perception, and the fear of societal rejection in ways that resonate deeply with anyone who has faced similar struggles. The narrative challenges traditional notions of masculinity and femininity, presenting Wukong as a character who defies categorization, who exists beyond the binary, and who ultimately finds strength in embracing his true self.The relationships Wukong forms throughout his journey are equally complex and meaningful. These interactions are not just about companionship or loyalty; they are profound explorations of love, attraction, and connection that transcend traditional boundaries. The game portrays these dynamics with a raw honesty, allowing players to experience the vulnerability, confusion, and ultimate acceptance that come with navigating one’s own sexuality.In a gaming industry that often hesitates to tackle such deeply personal and socially relevant topics, Black Myth: Wukong stands as a bold and necessary departure. It is a game that not only normalizes LGBTQ themes but places them at the forefront of its narrative, giving them the attention and respect they deserve. The portrayal of Wukong’s journey is not just a subplot; it is the very essence of the game’s story, making it a deeply moving experience for players.Black Myth: Wukong is more than just an action RPG; it is a powerful exploration of what it means to be true to oneself in a world that often demands conformity. It is a celebration of individuality, of the courage to embrace one’s identity, and of the strength that comes from self-acceptance. The game challenges players to not only engage with its epic battles and intricate gameplay but to reflect on their own perceptions of identity, gender, and sexuality.This is a game that will be remembered not just for its technical brilliance or its stunning visuals, but for its heart – for the way it tells a story that is as universal as it is deeply personal. Black Myth: Wukong is a triumph in storytelling, a beacon of inclusivity, and a testament to the power of video games to push boundaries and explore the human condition in all its complexity."
Positive,"Good game, performance not good.Default Unreal Engine r.Tonemapper.Sharpen value of 3.9 and no way of changing it in-game is a complete meme - even 1 is a lot... 3.9 is eye torture, Dev's get your eyes checked.No HDR in Triple A game that uses Unreal Engine 5 is also quite pathetic. Even SDR is broken with a black level floor raise. This is really embarrassing."
Positive,"Not fully optimized yet, but we have a game that's right on track with how gaming should be going. Game has some technical issues, but as a game and story encompassing the Sun Wukong myth, I couldn't be more excited to keep playing. As of this righting, I'm at the bear fight at the top of the mountain.P.S. I had some issues with screen tearing in the beginning; took me a couple hours to fully figure out. To fix, I set Vsync to ""off"" in-game, and ""on"" via GeForce Control panel. Happy gaming!"

Positive,"It's rare that a game lives up to the hype these days, but Black Myth WuKong does just that. It was promised as a visual spectacle with amazing combat and boss fights and it is certainly that. While I at times get frustrated and want to quit, like I did shortly before writing this, I also feel an immense satisfaction after beating a tough enemy. Game is pretty linear as well which I like, a lot of games are TOO open these days but this one is lazer focused on action scenes. Decent customisation, mechanics and some cool build possibilities, it's a genuinely great game. The ONLY big issue I have is the lack of difficulty slider and the lack of a mini map. Look it's 2024, if you wanna be a pro Elden Ring player that's cool, but some of us just want some cool fighting combat and to beat up enemies. Not everything needs to be a GIT GOOD style game. And for people who DO want that, they can continue to play on the higher difficulties. Other than that, having a lot of fun and even though I need a break for now because of those damn archers killing me, I will be back."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a good third person action game. The visuals are amazing, the music is great, the story is alright, and the combat is decent.The optimization isn't 100% there. The combat can get janky."
Positive,China Number 1GOTY of 2024Its not even closeGame gets exponentially better with each chapter you complete and ends with two of the best final bosses in recent memory
Positive,APES TOGETHER STRONG !!!
Positive,Only got an hour in but i really enjoy this game so far.Smooth combat and the game looks/performs great on my setup. Does not seem to be souls game level of difficulty but only have fought a few minor bosses.Monkey tested.Monkey approved.
Positive,"The combat is so original, it doesn't feel like it's borrowing too heavily from anything previous. The art direction is world class. I can't wait for ng+5000000000.My only criticism so far is the mobs: they aren't very engaging to me but I think the game is aware of that and balances it out with a reservoir of really fun bosses. This game is all about the bosses.Also, the opening, my god, is *chefs kiss*.Buy this game."
Positive,I could not play it on mint and while I was trying to fix it with proton experimental it denuvo locks me out for 24 hours. Fuck waiting for something I paid for.edit: they fixed it and with 20 hours in I can say this is a good game.

Positive,A game that brought the joy of childhood that has been missing for years. A game of the decades to come.
Positive,"Wukong is phenomenal. That's it. Now you can go and play it.Who would've thought that a game that came practically out of nowhere and many people were doubting would even be real would be so good? First of all, I just want to mention that my current play time allowed me to finish Wukong with majority of its side content. I may not have killed all the bosses and missed two things here and there, but overall I managed to beat every secret and unlocked the true ending.Nearly everything about this game is fantastic. The bosses are varied and there is no repetition, with the exception of one or two bosses. But that can be forgiven with its vast menagerie of 107 bosses overall. The graphics are simply beautiful. The music - fantastic. You will know what I am saying especially when you get into the Chapter 2. The story is not complicated, but it is beautifully told through the mixture of in-game cutscenes and hand-drawn interludes. It will definitely make you engaged!But the most important thing is that in my opinion Black Myth: Wukong, like no other game, has nearly perfect power progression. You start weak and as nothing - and at the end of the game you truly feel the power that was gained through the entire journey. I cannot overstate how amazing the feeling is, especially in the ending scenes of the True ending. Yes, in every game you start as a weak character and build upon it but in here it is just done perfectly. In the end, you will feel that it was all worth it.On the neutral side - the game is not an open world. For me personally, I am exhausted with every game taking 100 hours to beat minimum and I welcomed this change of pace. Wukong can be comfortably beat in 25-35 hours as you can see, even if you want to explore every nook and cranny.I have heard many times people comparing Wukong to Souls, but there is not that much that they have in common. Yes, there is stamina, there are gourds (estus, but imo improved in every way) and the enemies respawn upon resting. That's it. That's the entirety of the Soul content in Wukong. The game is probably a bit more difficult than God of War, but both people who want to have more of a casual challenge and be pushed a lot will find something in this game. Wukong can be customized in a lot of ways, so everybody will find a more or less powerful playstyle for themselves. Oh, and I'd also forget - the quality of life in this game is insane. Forget being forced to play one build and not being able to respec; if you change your mind, at any time about your decisions in Wukong, you can amend them freely. I cannot state enough how refreshing that is.Now, there are some problems with the game. Personally, Chapter 3 has been a slog. It introduced one of the most ridiculously annoying mechanic that I have seen in video games in a long time and the story of it was forgettable. The mechanic can be quickly dealt with (unfortunately probably you will look for a guide that tells you how), and once the chapter is over the story quickly picks up again.The optimization is also not perfect. But, as always, it's a bit of Nvidia's broken promises that with a sufficient graphics card you can play a title with Raytracing. For me, on RTX 3080 with 12GB VRAM I was only able to have smooth, capped 60 FPS without the ray tracing. Even on low the game was stuttering, unbearably.But, those two reasons are not enough for me to to not recommend this game. In fact, Wukong is a must play if you like God Of War like games."
Positive,"As a Chinese player who is familiar with the Journey to the West story and always had the monkey king as the first ever childhood hero, this game is all that I can ever hope for. I proudly recommend this game to all."
Positive,Great game with multiple great boss. Less hard than a souls game.
Positive,game of the year
Positive,"Best game ever made, period\If this game does not win game of the year, then the gaming industry is rigged"
Positive,"A peak of 2 million players and 140k positive reviews all on the first day of release. There’s a lot of sentimentality influencing the positive reviews, so how good is the game really? Here’s my review after completing the game with all endings, and beating all 81 bosses in the span of 45 hours of gameplay.The story of Black Myth takes place after the events of the 15th century novel Journey to the West, and contrary to popular belief, you don’t actually play as the titular Sun Wukong, but a monkey known as “The Destined One”.So I’ve got good news and bad news in that department. The bad news is that a lot of Black Myth’s story references the novel and features many of its characters. As someone with only rudimentary knowledge of the novel, parts of the story were somewhat confusing to me. It also did not help that the game also features a number of Buddhist jargon.However, the good news is that I don’t think one needs to understand the finer details to appreciate the overall story, because the gist of your mission is easy enough to understand. I also see the story as a somewhat of an anthology because it features many different tales told via stunning animations and raw emotions that anyone can appreciate and feel regardless of language or foreknowledge of the novel.Combat in this game is actually fairly straightforward. Your primary weapon is a staff, and there’s a single light attack combo and 5 different heavy attacks depending on how much “focus” you have. These attacks can have several added variations to them depending on various skills and stances. And as you progress through the game, you gain access to many more different spells and abilities, which can provide a good amount of variety.IMO, the main strength of combat comes from enemy design. Enemies don’t just look incredibly original and cool; they also have some of the best attack sequences I’ve ever seen. Boss fights are something like dance battles of sorts; you watch attack patterns, learn to dodge accordingly, and unleash your attack combos when you find openings.I found overall combat to be very smooth and satisfying and could not identify any major flaws with it at all.Black Myth is advertised as being a linear experience, and that’s true in the sense that it isn’t an open world game. But the zones in the game can get MASSIVE. Have you ever played an open world game and decided to go exploring off the beaten track to see if you could find some loot, only to just end up in dead ends with nothing? In Black Myth, the game rewards your explorative efforts with various loot, unique monsters, cutscenes, new abilities, secret bosses, and sometimes just straight up entirely new secret zones. Basically, if you think there is something in a certain direction, there probably is going to be something. There is so much optional content in this game that I’d say it makes up more than half the entire experience.And for those worried about the game becoming a tedious walking simulator, fret not, because this game has plenty of shrines peppered around the map that serve as fast travel points, ensuring that exploration never really feels like a slog.However, there are a number of flaws in this department. For one, the game does not make it visually clear where you can and cannot explore. Some obstacles you can jump over, and others are just blocked by invisible walls. This can get pretty jarring and mildly annoying at times, but at least the game doesn’t punish you by making you travel down long paths only to hit invisible walls. The second complaint that many have is the absence of a map. As zones can get pretty large, it can be easy to get lost if you don’t have the best sense of direction. Personally, I think I understand the creative decision not to include a map, because it does hit differently when you explore and discover secret areas on your own, as opposed to constantly opening a map to see where you’re going. I found that the game did train me to find my bearings by way of identifying landmarks, kind of like the old days without GPS.I enjoyed the sense of discovery in this game, but it definitely would’ve been nice if Game Science added a “Guiding Wind” function like Ghost of Tsushima to provide players with some directional guidance.Many have said this is the hardest game they’ve ever played, while others have found the difficulty manageable. Personally, I don’t consider this game THAT difficult because of the following:-There are almost no insta-death mechanics-You have access to a healing flask that can be used and upgraded multiple times-You can use temporary stat boosting supplements-You don’t need to perform perfect dodges and mistakes are forgivable-There is no lengthy test of concentration-Bosses can get challenging, but are never really “cheap”Personally, I consider Black Myth to be challenging, but not a “difficult” game, and would rate it 7/10 in terms of difficulty. With patience and perseverance, I believe almost anyone can beat this game. I’ve played a lot of visually stunning games: TW3, RDR2 etc. And IMO, Black Myth is second to none in terms of its visuals and artistic direction. From the beautiful backdrops, detailed and culturally rich architecture, gorgeous lighting, particle physics, I just keep mouthing “holy sh*t” every time I explored somewhere new. Also, you are rewarded with beautifully directed animations at the conclusion of every chapter. I don’t even know how to properly describe what Game Science has done in this video game because it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. Every chapter just kept blowing me away and I think Black Myth is a true landmark in video games as an art form.I felt that the flexibility deserves a section of its own because of how well Black Myth does it. Ever played games with fast travel and skill trees? Notice how when you want to fast travel or reset skill points, you need materials or money to do so? Well this game has none of that nonsense. You can fast travel from anywhere and reallocate skill points at no cost whatsoever. This takes away that common concern about having the “perfect build” because you can experiment freely. The game also packs half its content in optional content, so those in a rush can simply just play the main content and be done with the game in under 25hrs.My specs:CPU: R7 5700XGPU: RX 7900 GRERAM: 16gb 3066mhz x2Display: 1440p 165mhzPersonally, I could get 80-100 FPS on max settings with almost no frame drops for 99% of the game. I found optimisation in this game to be exceptional, but it seems that those with higher end rigs may encounter issues, so be sure to be sure to do research accordingly.I was one of the many skeptics of this game, expecting either a disappointing flop at worst, or a fancy looking linear boss rush at best. Yes, this game is far from perfect and is definitely rough around the edges, but there is so much right that I don’t think the cons detract much from the experience at all.Game Science has managed to accomplish something I never could’ve considered to be even possible, and delivered a memorable AAA experience that I would unreservedly consider to be the current leading contender for Game of the Year."
Positive,most of boys born in China have a dram in which they have become Sun Wukong who turn the Tianting over and over .
Positive,"Solid action adventure.Resembles a Souls game at first glance, but Wukong is much faster paced, less punishing on death, and much very heavier on boss fights. Lots and lots of boss fights. Despite their numbers, the bosses are not repeats or reskins - this is over 50 completely unique huge bosses.Loads of hidden areas, numerous viable builds, and spectacularly beautiful animation.My only gripe is the lack of map and lack of quest log or journal, making it easy to get lost and hard to track side quests. Stay focused when playing or you will miss clues, and the game does not hold your hand."
Positive,"Initial Impression? Game is Amazing. If you were looking for something to tie you over till a new Devil May Cry game or just til Final Fantasy 16 is out on PC, this is it. Its fun, difficult and not terribly exposition ridden. You jump right into the action and the CG sequences are worth experiencing. I don't know how my opinion will change later but this purchase feels good.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After having spent so many hours playing through the game, I have some contentions. I was frustrated at times but one instance is truly a problem. Somewhere in the game you're given a task that does a stat check of sorts. If you're unable to meet that stat check, you'd probably end up wandering around looking for what issue could be burdening you. Simply raise the effected stats until they work and you won't be hopping mad about what to do. Beyond the minor frustrating bits, the game is excellent. It is exactly what I ask for in an action game. Not too much exposition, rewarding cutscenes and cool cinematics instead of mindless chatter. Its a damn action game so it should have cool moves and sick style. Nothing felt better than being able to walk in fights to dare bosses to try and hit me. I often met a bitter end for being so eccentric but I enjoyed it so much. The combat is the most solid part of the game and its not locked down to any specific play-style. My go to was just to get really good at dodging. It was so fun to experience a game that didn't put limits on how much you can dodge and do moves in general. The Stamina bar is the only real restriction but you could build the Destined One to use the lack of stamina as a tool. How detailed you can get with how you want to play helps a lot with bosses. I've ran into considerable walls in terms of a few bosses but have been able to overcome them by retooling my character and concentrating on my dodge timing to get perfects. If I didn't have to sleep I'd still be playing the game right now, it is a really fun experience and I think you're actually missing out if you haven't at least tried the game. This game really pulled at the nostalgia I feel for games like Demon's Crest, SOTN and Illusion of Gaia. Definitely a must play."

This hit box is a huge issue.I've since beaten the game and unlocked the true ending, although the hit box problem is still an issue the overall experience was amazing."

The game’s meticulous attention to detail is evident in its breathtaking environments and intricate character designs, which collectively create a visually captivating experience. The fluidity and depth of the combat system are particularly noteworthy, showcasing a sophisticated blend of dynamic action and strategic depth. Furthermore, the game’s seamless integration of traditional Chinese mythology with innovative gameplay elements presents a refreshing and immersive narrative. The developers have clearly invested significant effort into crafting a world that is both rich in lore and engaging to navigate. Overall, this game promises to deliver a compelling and memorable experience that is sure to resonate with both fans of the genre and newcomers alike. I am eager to explore its vast world and uncover the epic story that awaits."

Positive,"So far so good! Fun as hell, hard as hell, you have lot´s of secrets to explore and bosses to defeat!A monkey and a pilar in your hands against everyone! For the ones who love mythology and epic boss fights this is the one.Enjoy this beautifull master piece.The game is well optimized, the trash talkers who talk about crashes probably got their processors fried or bad gpus.Well I enjoyed the game in every aspect, I found every secret area, boss and items, and it is worth it do it so because the endind will be diferent and the items you can get are a game changer. You have bosses if you miss a secret item, prepare to cry because you will get your ass beat, and after much rage and effort you will eventually do it.Basically the first playthrough will be your harder one, and if you miss something yeah bosses can be harder than any soul games bosses and dont be mad soulgames lovers this one isn´t that harder (in general), but I founded way prettier and funny, with each boss with unique and gorgeous movements.Nem Game +, basically you are Wukong in the lore, that beat everyone ass with overpowered powers. I am loving it.Congrats to the devs for the hard work at this piece of art.This is the first game that I recommend at full price."
Positive,"The story of this game can be seen as a continuation of the traditional Chinese myth, *Journey to the West*. However, the charm of the game does not simply lie in its connection to ""traditional mythology."" In extending the mythological narrative, it cleverly uses elements from the original story to introduce (or perhaps construct?) a different side of the story—one that readers (or viewers) of the original work could not see. The transition is seamless and thought-provoking.For me, someone who was born and raised in China, who has been immersed in the story of *Journey to the West* and knows it inside out, the game offers a brand new perspective. Just like in the real world, we can never fully see the darker side behind the ""great, bright, and righteous"" image established by the ""heavenly court."" Life, like the game, mirrors this complexity. As we, like the protagonist, follow the path once trodden by Sun Wukong, seeing what he saw and doing what he did, we eventually come to realize and understand whether his world and his life were truly as bright and glorious as we have been led to believe.As Shakespeare once said: ""Men at some time are masters of their fates: The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves that we are underlings."""

Positive,"This will probably get buried in the reviews, but the goal of this review is to answer one question, is it a souls-like?  The answer is somewhat complicated:*  There is a bonfire mechanic (souls-like)*  There is a estus flask mechanic (souls-like)*  Your primary defense is dodging (50% souls-like)*  You get level up points to spend in a number of skill trees (not souls-like)*  There is NO death penalty and you don't have to recover your body (not souls-like)*  In terms of difficulty, it's much easier then most soulslikes, but starting out is VERY difficult till you level up a bit and expand you capabilities.*  This game seems to have numerous bosses and mini-bosses, I am not even done with chapter 1 and I have fought 5 Bosses, and like 4-5 elites.*  Inventory feels more like a souls like.*  Weapons -- I believe you will have the same weapon throughout the entire game, but that weapon has different stances which change it's feel*  Armor/Gear -- you can both craft and find armor and each armor, each piece of armor seems to have unique bonuses to it and most of the craftable armor has set bonuses. You also have two ring slots and a ""gord slot"" which is another form of upgradable gear (but also controls your estus swigs)*  I haven't unlocked upgrading yet, but I suspect it's in the game (based on the numerous differnet upgrade materials I have found)*  Stats are basically set in this game, they are gear based and upgrade node based, but leveling up is NOTHING like a souls like.All in all this game plays like a souls-like early on, but as you level up your character it starts to feel more and more classic GoW or classic Darksiders.As for my thoughts on this game, I think it is excellent and worth every penny."
Positive,"❗Unrelated Rant Incoming❗I absolutely hate Dune (2021). I absolutely hate everything it represents. I hate the cast, I hate how overhyped it is, I hate how boring the movie actually turned out to be; but most of all, I DESPISE the people that say that you have to had read the books in order to grasp and comprehend the movie. As if my opinion is somehow less valid for not partaking in complimentary activities about the media I am consuming. As if it wasn't fair to expect that a piece of art should be able to stand on its own. I think that is complete dog shit. Personally, I have never been able to finish reading a complete book, let alone a 1000 page book like Dune (I have a broken sense of attention like most of us do today). So to me, when someone manifests to my face a finger-waggy, ""morally superior"", mounted-on-a-high--white-stallion, holier than thou READ THE BOOK FIRST OR ELSE opinion, I kinda lose my shit. The movie sucks bro. The characters are super bland, the events feel unimportant, the performances are weak (the photo is pretty good though). You can't expect me to excuse it being trash under the excuse that reading the book will suddenly make it amazing. The OG Lord of the Rings didn't have that problem. Neither did Fightclub, neither did No Country for Old Men (and many more examples). Thankfully though, neither does Black Myth: Wukong.I am a huge believer that if something is actually good, you don't need to understand the innerworkings of it to experience and identify that it is good. Think of a great meal you had recently - or better yet, think of a great song you heard. Think of the intense feelings it gave you. Bask in the meadows of multicolored worlds that it allowed you to travel. Think of how it made you remember that one time when your mom picked you up from school and took you to McDonalds. It feels good doesn't it? At worst, it FEELS. It makes you feel things. The mere existence of it makes you understand that you are in awe and you feel a towering presence looming over you. This is how good art feels. Whether its food or music or a videogame. You don't need to understand how its cooked, how its composed or in this case; you don't need to read a 3000 page book to witness what a great game Black Myth is.Rant aside, this is a game that is based on a very old chinese novel, a Journey to the West. The novel is hugely influential since it served as inspiration to birth many of todays most beloved characters (Goku from DBZ and Luffy from One Piece for example). Something that you definitely don't have to know to enjoy the game, although (despite my rant before) it does add some context for the aesthetics and a lot of context for the story. It's very refreshing to play a game that feels so good in its mechanics, but that is also not a western game. I feel like sometimes chinese games have the stigma that they are going to be cheap or mobile game-like, but in reality I found that this game plays a lot like a very polished bloodborne.I always enjoyed games that are submerged in mythological lore and to me the chinese myth lore has always been extremely deep and vast. There are many archetypes that are portrayed beautifully in the game and the many characters that appear in it. It always brought a smile to my face to witness the cartoon like joy and naiveté of certain characters during the adventure. I feel like games that are rooted in ancestral stories are always bound to feel very related, especially when they're done in an artsy way and when other videogame elements like combat mechanics and progression don't stand in the way of it.The combat, like I mentioned before, reminds me somewhat of bloodborne. (Think of a bloodborne and devil may cry blend) There is a lot of dodging and a lot of fast paced mechanics. The destined one (which I forgot to mention is our silent hero in this case), carries a huge assortment of spells and maneuvers that never make the combat feel stale. You can also turn into many types of Yao Guais (how the mobs are referred to in this game) you defeat and capture along the way, allowing people that really like to switch up the gameplay, have a new set of tools to try every so often. The variety of bosses and mobs in this game is just astounding. I wouldn't fault you if you thought that this game was more of a boss rush at first, just due to the fact of the sheer amount of bosses you get to fight as soon as the game starts.This is no dark souls though. Most bosses, even when looking and moving in a very intimidating way, weren't extremely difficult to defeat. I was able to tear through most (Fuck you Erlang) of them in one or two tries. Sometimes three. Thankfully I think this is a really good plus for the game. Having many bosses that are beatable and feel fair really gives the player a strong dopamine boost to keep playing. The game also rewards you a lot with items to craft armor and weapons fairly consistently and I mention this because everything looks really beautiful. I mean, I know that ""receiving materials for crafting"" sounds possibly incredibly boring or mundane, but in this game it always feels like it's something you earned - and I am not sure if it was because the game was made in unreal engine 5, but EVERYTHING looks beautiful. The feedback for getting items. The bosses, the environments. Really pristine - and honestly It only hits so hard because the game is really good. Looking good on its own rarely does good things.Now, I kinda get why the devs did this, but I actually do not understand at all the lack of a map in this game. Despite it not being an open world game, you get lost ALOT. Sometimes you want to advance a sidequest or you're exploring part of the map and suddenly you unknowingly advance the main story and get thrown out of the area. Part of the reason this is hard to deal with is because the story is very dense and very hard to follow. You need sometime to unpack the things that happen or maybe follow sidequests to distract yourself from the main thing. I found myself constantly being betrayed by my muscle memory only to realize I had paused the game looking for a map for the 100th time. I know many games do this too, but if you play it, you will see how easily you will get lost. It's not a great feeling.After many hours and many many many boss fights, there's a section at the end of the game where the map opens up a bit more and you get to fly on top of a cloud like Goku - and that's pretty fucking awesome.I know I always complain that reviewing really long games is hard for me - and this game is no exception. There's always a lot to say and unpack especially if the game inspires me to talk about different themes that contain more things than just the game. Sometimes it feels overwhelming and this game is truly an overwhelming game. You have to take the time and play it over several weeks to really immerse yourself in this world and the story. One that is truly worth it and will leave you marked with the archetypes that us humans have kept alive by telling stories over many generations. Stories that have reached our modern day and are told in such a way that bring us value and tools for effective introspection.Thank you if you reached this part of my review. It was really cathartic to write and If you are on the fence about this game, I really hope you give it a shot.I would def give it 4.5 一只被选中的猴子 out of 5 🐒🐒🐒🐒"
Positive,I don't know how on God's Green Earth is possible for a game studio to debut with a game like this.The graphics are insane and I don't know why they went so crazy on the visuals since this is a game similar to Elden Ring so it's not GTA or Cyberpunk.I only had 1 crash in 1 hour of gameplay after the first fight in the opening.Other than that runs like butter in 1080P Maxed out settings with FSR 100% uspscale and FG on using an RX 7900 XTX and a Ryzen 7 7800X3D paired with 64GB RAM averaging +100fps.
Positive,"Good game and an exciting journey.This game has an amazing world to explore, interesting characters to meet and cool bosses to fight. I really love boss fights so far, they are very memorable and enjoyable. Also, gameplay mechanics and combat system both are cool/fun.P.S. Finally, a game without woke BS. I like it."
Positive,"Much more than what i expected to be, this game really came in as a suprise.Combat is really smooth and theres so many abilities and tricks you can do even 3-4 hours into the game.No need to talk about graphics other than above expected performance, absolutely stunning.Boss fights are really good, some do dodges / feints which is a welcome experience. Not gonna say as hard as sekiro or souls games but i definitely see the potential because i've fought like 5 bosses in 3 hours and im still in the first area i think, stuck at one of them lol.Lastly my favorite thing, cinematic inclusions to bossfights, really increases the production value in my eyes x)Kind of feels like a god of war and sekiro had a child in a good way, buy it \o/"

Positive,"I’ve played almost every souls like game, and even loved the bad ones. I got to say, the Chinese mythology in this game is amazing and the combat is so fluid and impactful. The story is amazing (from what I’ve seen so far in 2 hours) and the game runs incredibly well even with my 3440x1440 curved monitor. I highly advise everyone get this game! If you don’t like it within the hour, you can refund it. Game is a solid 10 for this guy!"
Positive,"It's a visually striking game, with fantastic designs, model, and texture work throughout. Environments, and water especially is just top notch. Bosses are varied, levels have lots of space to explore, and the story is great. The music and songs are also very good, and there are animated intermissions in different styles!My only issue is level design. The number of one-way traversals is just too great, with no shortcuts or even regular backtracking: often your only way to get to the earlier location is to fast travel, which is a bummer. Also, the last chapter is just too huge to the point of being needlessly intimidating. I understand why it is the way it is, but again, with better level design, you could've made it clearer where the points of interest are. At least there's only one chest to find.Also, some collectibles are random drops, and there's only one item that increases the chance very slightly, so that's annoying. And, of course, the system requirements for the best visual quality is extremely high, but it's not here, nor there."
Positive,"The best thing about this game is the lore, Second one is the visual, the art direction is top tier!Its game play mechanic is fun and feels rewarding."

Positive,"The SHEER AMOUNT of LINEAR ALGEBRA packed into this game is insane, and it doesn't even include the fully Quantized Neural Network that runs with minimal RAM with sub-second end to end latency.

Everything you want to see in a fantastic next-gen AAA game:- next-gen graphics (best I've seen so far, and I only have/play AAA games)- great gameplay (best fighting system - very fluid and fun)- fantastic sound (switch to Mandarin voice for better experience)- amazing storyline"
Positive,"I am an avid soulslike  player since the beginning. While I was so impressed with the graphics, I was not impressed with the difficulty of this game (INITIALLY). It felt very easy and I was rolling through the game. HOWEVER as you progress through the game and depending how you approach exploring, this game gets HARD. All in all, this is a VERY fun game. If you like God of war, or any souls game, you will enjoy this game. Careful because this game goes hard if you don't have an updated computer :)"
Positive,"The combat is one of the best in any action RPG I've played before. The hits are so satisfying, and the three stance systems while having the same light attack, the heavy attacks all have different utilities and usages. The magic spells combined with those different stances can create some unique and interesting build options. Overall, I came for the story, and love it, but stayed for the combat."

Positive,"As a player crazy for arpg games, i found this quite satisfing. Ive played nioh, darksoul, sekiro, elden ring for over 800h, and wukong's combat is the best. Each boss has its own characteristics. The combat pace is quite different between bosses, but every movement is rational and can be learned through tring. the game is much easier than nioh but with more fun to combat.Of course this game have limitations due to this inexperienced studio. The skills and equipments system is quite simple compared to nioh, and level design is quite plain compared to darksouls. However, numerous unique and wonderful boss fight can always bring new excitement.if you are a new gamer interested in arpg, wukong is a great start with lower difficultiy and gorgeous combats"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a good game, but not a great game. I'm giving it an 7/10 simply because the environmental artist went crazy. Easily one of the best-looking games on the market. Worth a playthrough, but probably forgotten and never played again. It tries to borrow from a lot of other similar titles but doesn't succeed in capturing what made those games special. Combat becomes increasingly tiresome as the game goes on due to the lack of meaningful combos (you pretty much just spam the same things every fight) which makes the lack of interesting level design very apparent. Bosses are cool in design, but none really captivate you like ones found in other action-adventure games. Last note: One thing that really upsets me is that the game starts off with this grand opening sequence, setting up wild expectations of what the game might be like, but never delivers that same feeling throughout the rest of its 40-50hour story. I wouldn’t say its false advertising, but if you saw clips and thought that’s what the game is going to be like…. nope."
Positive,"Just the best game in all aspectsStory - wonderfulGraphics - spectacularCombat - wonderfulMusic - eargasmAudience - all can play ezno bugs and not grindy Full gameplay, All secrets and All quests with both endings in one playthrough >"
Positive,"Absolutely bananas game. As if dad of war fused with nioh within the chinese mythology of journey to the wests Sun Wukong. If you can embrace monke. This is it.A lot of the bosses require some skill, certainly not easy (chapter 2 endboss took me 1 1/2 hours, combat is smooth and fun (turn to stone to deflect on cooldown, easy to learn hard to master perfect dodges). There are a lot of secrets and optional stuff. The only thing I dont like are the dad of war chests with mats for crafting buffs and a loooot of invisible walls.Western Media Outlets talking about boss rush blah nothing to discover etc are full of dirt. Maps are massive with a lot of trash to kill and stuff to find and loot."
Positive,The second chapter surpassed all souls & souls-likes I have experienced. GOTY 2024!
Positive,Overall an amazing game with a great story & solid combat. 10/10 would buy again!Only minor downside is the lack of an in-game map which would have made exploring a lot easier.

Positive,"I think this is likely going to take game of the year.  My knowledge of Journey to the West isn't great, but the things I do know about it, I can tell a lot of love went into this.  It seems very respectful of the source material.  The visuals and just the fantastical stuff that happens is an absolute treat.  Combat is fun and you get a lot of options for builds and mechanics to try and exploit.The whole package is just an amazing experience and I recommend it highly."
Positive,"Awesome game, environment, music, story, and combat are to perfection. Combat in general, doesn't only depend upon abilities, weapons, and builds and it's adjustable according to the player's requirements and needs, it couldn't have been more perfect than this. Even though the music is in the native language, you still vibe with it while playing the game. And graphics and environment were so beautiful that every time I went to a new area, I wanted to capture it.The story takes place after the events of the Journey to the West and the way they have narrated the whole story is marvellous. Every chapter will take you to a new area and tell a story about those who live there. Chapters 4 and 5 were the peak of the way the story unfolds.Now let's talk about the cons, chapter 6 is the weakest chapter in the whole story, and after the banger of an episode before that, I expected more. Boss fights and side bosses of the chapter are not memorable at all. But it's not the worst thing about chapter 6. The worst thing is optimization, your fps will drop considerably and come to around/below 60, and micro stutters start. They will surely patch it out later. Invisible walls are pain in the ars, devs should have could have dealt with it in different manner.I  DON'T RECOMMEND if you want to 100 percent the game, as so many different items are locked behind very low rng. I killed one type of enemy around 100+ times to get random armor just for the sake of achievement and that armor wasn't even worth that grind,Overall, awesome game, definitely one of the game of the year contenders.

Positive,"My gf not just a soulslike game player, not even interested in playing games, is so obsessed in playing this and calling me everytime to play this together, taking turns. She's learning so fast and love everything about this game. I am in paradise because of this game. :)"
Positive,"There are a lot of advantages to say about Blackmyth Wukong.And it's very prominent.For example, cinema-level picture quality,Rich and in-depth combat system,Very top art and boss performances,Very large volume,All kinds of touching small details of the original “Journey to the west”, etc.But I personally think it's a bit of a pity in terms of plot.The first 5 chapters, especially the 2,3 chapters, are very good.But the ending feels a little hasty (I hope the DLC can make up for it),In addition, there are some small problems with the map guide design. But objectively speaking, as the first stand-alone video game of Game Science, it is already very outstanding, a stunning work , even if it is put 3A game, it is also one of the top 3A game."
Positive,"Based on my experience playing this game for the first time, I did not encounter a single bug or glitch, which is impressive for first-time players. I played on my laptop with the graphics settings maxed out, and the game ran smoothly. I also used a PS4 controller, which worked seamlessly. This game is a must-play, and I highly recommend it.  I own the deluxe edition, but I would say it's not worth the extra cost. The deluxe edition includes music and in-game items, but those items are primarily useful only for Chapter 1. From Chapter 2 onwards, you will need to craft items to progress and defeat bosses. Enjoy"
Positive,"I had an absolute blast playing the game.Overall the difficulty was completely okey, its just a case of get good in some bosses. I absolutely loved it to get stuck on a boss because it made me experiment with other items and skill combinations and because they make it free to change its always a rewarding feeling when you change something and it starts working.The visuals and audio are also stunning. The Chinese VAs did a beautiful job and I loved every character. I always looked forward to completing a chapter to see that end cutscene.The only part I can actually complain about is 100%ing the game, the RNG drops are so bad, even with some item drop boosts it sometimes took an hour+ to get that single item for an achievement but other than that when you explore and just be curious about the environment you can easily complete 85-90% of the game in the first playthrough.The length is also very nice, for my first playthrough (Going for as much achievements as possible) it took me ~55-60 hours, going for 100% afterwards only took another 4-5 hours so a total time of ~65 hours.I will now go for NG++ and NG+++ to actually complete everything (I have all achivements but theres still something to get)I can only recommend the game and Im looking forward to whats coming next!"
Positive,Game of the year worthy.

Positive,"Great and very fun game. Dev's put a lot of care into it. Combat is very fun and satisfieing. Story is great based on legit myth from China. Bosse's are chelanging and very satisfieing when you kill finally. Only bad thing is, when you grind a bit to much its getting a bit easy. Chapter 4 meant to have the hardest bosse's in game and i havent died once on any of them becouse my lvl was a bit higher than meant to be for that chapter. Gonna see how's NewGame+ will be like :) hope for bigger chalange   9/10"

Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong – Seriously One of the Best Games I’ve Played Lately!I’ve gotta say, Black Myth: Wukong is easily one of the best games I’ve played recently. I had such a great time with it! The game just looks amazing, and the world they’ve built is super immersive.One of the things I really enjoyed is how the game has a Souls-lite feel. Unlike proper Souls games, this one doesn't make you sweat as much. The difficulty is manageable, and you can progress without feeling overly punished, which makes the gameplay more enjoyable for players who prefer a less intense challenge.The lore is also super interesting—based on Chinese mythology, which makes everything feel fresh and unique. The story, the characters, and the whole vibe just pull you in.Honestly, if you’re into action RPGs and don’t want the full-on pain of a Souls game, you should definitely check this out."
Positive,"Despite CONSTANT performance issues and audio desyncing during cutscenes, crashing during the final moments of the hardest bosses in the game, and the inability to load small isolated levels without experiencing dips to 11fps, Black Myth: Wukong is a charming and fun game with an interesting story and lore, unique enemies throughout the entire game, varied and engaging combat mechanics, and of course great voice acting and music. The end of each chapter features a unique and beautifully animated cutscene which tells more of the story related to the chapter you just completed or the characters you met, which stood out to me as some of my favourite parts of the game. Don't listen to the bum game critics, this game is easily worth the money."
Positive,"A game with a beautifully crafted story around the legend of wukong.It's a game similar to almost none, in the sense that it has:- no microtransactions- no DEI or other leftwing politics- no artificial difficulty for the sake of difficulty- a complete and bugfree release- a great singleplayer experienceI'm not gonna talk about how fun the combat and how beautiful the game is, instead I'd like to highlight that this game is a step in the right direction.And I really hope that Game Science releases many more games to come while keeping their integrity intact.This game would be worth it even if it was sold for $200. So buy it as soon as you can, gaming doesn't get much better than this"
Positive,"This is far beyond a game, this is an epic art piece."
Positive,"This is likely my GOTY for 2024. The gameplay is a lot of fun, there's tons of collectibles that have an actual effect on said gameplay, and the length of the game is just right in my opinion.Black Myth Wukong is six chapters long with distinct explorable zones. These zones are littered with things to find, enemies to fight and exciting boss encounters. And this game has a TON of bosses, it felt like a boss rush at times. They're very rewarding too, often giving you transformations to turn into the bosses/enemies you fought.  There are 54 enemies in the game that you can transform into for a single attack, called ""spirits"" and an additional 8 transformations which have a timer and entirely different move sets. For combat there are three stances which have different heavy attacks, and a multitude of spells that range from freezing enemies to making copies of yourself. There's a lot of potential for various builds, for example lightning, poison, and crit, just to name a few. There are a handful of weapons and a decent amount of armor that all have different abilities and they all look really cool. I think if you're a fan of soulslike games you'll feel at home with the systems in the game, but I don't think Wukong is nearly as challenging as those.The story is based off of Journey to the West, which I didn't know much about besides a loose understanding of Sun Wukong when I started playing. Since then I've listened to the audiobook for it and I think it enhances the experience, so if you know anything about the story you might enjoy it more too. There are a lot of cool details. That being said the game stands on its own and you don't need any prior knowledge.I played through the game twice to 100% the achievements but it technically takes three times to fully 100% the game. There's a NG+ where your items carry over and there are ""relics"" that are upgradeable with every completed chapter. On the third playthrough those ""relics"" can be brought to the max level.I'd say my only gripes with the game are that there are quite a few items and bosses that you can miss, which made my NG+ necessary. Like for the ones I missed, you needed to do something before you did something else, or you would be locked out until the next playthrough and did it in the correct order. The other thing which is really a non issue is that there are some areas with cool things off in the distance which you can't go to, and to extend on that thought, there are a lot of invisible walls. The game doesn't feel linear because a lot of the zones are so large, but it is fairly linear.Black Myth Wukong is a recommendation in my opinion, I'll probably play through it again in the near future and I hope you do too.TL;DR- Yes. Buy. Very Good."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is, without a doubt, one of the most visually stunning and mechanically engaging games to release in 2024. In my view, this game is a clear contender for Game of the Year. Anyone who dismisses it—looking at you, IGN—hasn’t fully experienced the brilliance this game offers. From its deep combat mechanics to its breathtaking visuals and compelling storytelling, Black Myth: Wukong excels on all fronts. Graphics and Performance I played this game on my RTX 4080 Super, with Cinematic Mode, ray tracing, and frame generation turned on, achieving 4K at 60 FPS. The visuals are truly next-level, showcasing detailed character models and environments that bring the mythical world to life. However, the game is demanding, and in new areas, I encountered some stuttering and frame drops as the game loaded assets. These moments were brief but noticeable. Still, the immersive world and incredible detail made the occasional hiccup worth the wait. Combat System The combat offers a great balance of complexity and fluidity, with three primary stances: Smash, Pillar, and Thrust. I found myself sticking with Smash Stance, which focuses on fast, close-range attacks. The Heavy Attack in Smash Stance, which you can charge while moving, was particularly versatile, allowing me to stay aggressive and adapt during intense battles. The quick strike combos and tactical flexibility make it ideal for both crowd control and taking down tougher foes, keeping combat engaging throughout. Storytelling and World-Building Where Black Myth: Wukong truly shines is in its storytelling and world-building. As I progressed through the game, I became fully immersed in the mythical world the developers have created. The end-of-chapter animations were particularly impactful, offering deeper insight into the lore and characters. Bajie’s story, in particular, stood out—his internal conflict between his clumsy, human nature and divine responsibilities made him a fascinating character. These story moments, combined with the game’s phenomenal production quality, drew me in further with each chapter. Achievements and Challenges The game’s achievements aren’t for the faint of heart. The Mantled with Might achievement, which requires obtaining or crafting all armor pieces, is a serious challenge. Some pieces are random drops, while others can be crafted by defeating specific bosses. However, the Bull King Armor Set needs six Bull King Iron Horns, and only four can be acquired per playthrough, making a New Game+ essential. On top of that, the Dark Iron Staff also needs two Iron Horns, requiring you to reach Chapter 5 in NG+ to complete your collection.Another tricky achievement is the Venomous Armguards. During the first fight with the Venom Daoist in Webbed Hollow’s Pool of Shattered Jade, you need to destroy four of his back arms (the top two can’t be destroyed). If you fail, the cutscene that follows removes his arms, locking you out of the achievement. This was a frustrating oversight during my first playthrough, but I managed to unlock it in NG+, which made it all the more satisfying. Production Quality The game’s production quality is nothing short of exceptional. The orchestral score adds depth to both quiet exploration and intense battles, while the sound effects bring each encounter to life. The voice acting—especially in the original Chinese—adds authenticity and depth to the characters and story, helping the world feel even more immersive. It’s clear that a great deal of care went into every detail of the game’s presentation. Conclusion In my opinion, Black Myth: Wukong is a clear contender for Game of the Year 2024. Its stunning visuals, intricate combat, and deeply immersive storytelling make it one of the best gaming experiences I’ve had in recent years. While the game is demanding both in terms of hardware and achievements, the overall experience is well worth the effort. If you’re a fan of action RPGs or Chinese mythology, this game should be at the top of your list. Forget the doubters—this game is truly a masterpiece."
Positive,"9/10 - One of the best action RPGs i've ever played. Even though the last chapters look rushed it is a must buy.Pros- Visuals are amazing- Rooted in Chinese mythology (Journey to the West), which is fresh compared to most Western RPGs- Combat is a 10/10- A lot of customization: builds, stances, spells- World-building is top-notch- AthmosphericCons:- The last two chapters feel a bit rushed and lose quality compared to the others.- Occasional non-game-breaking bugs- Overuse of invisible walls- Monkeh does not speak :("
Positive,"One of the best single player games I've ever played. Smooth combat, big variety of enemies, amazing soundtrack, stunning graphics/art style and a deep story with a really well made animation for each chapter. You can see they really put an effort to tell about the journey of the west without missing any detail of their wide culture. Everyone should give it a chance."
Positive,Me like monkey me play
Positive,really fun game
Positive,"This game is very fun and I'm quite familiar with the Wukong lore. I watched Journey to the West as a child. About 20 years after it's release of its show. Gameplay is rewarding and unlike other titles like Elden Ring or Dark Souls this game has completely drawn me in story wise as well as meaningfulness. I encourage all gamers to try this game out. Definitely deserves its high rating on Steam.edit: grammar. Also, this game needs OPTIMIZATION!!! Micro-stutters are noticeable and annoying! I run rtx 4080 and i9 13900kf and ddr4 3600mhz 32gb"
Positive,"This game frequently got compared to NIOH/Sekiro/DS/Elden Ring/any other souls-like or sometimes to God of War. If you played this game, you will know that the tempo and gameplay is totally different from all those, the one that give the closest feeling to this is actually wolong. The evasion window in this game is so much more forgiving and you can spam around 3 time evade in a row before a soft-cooldown, seems like the devs are not trying to make this game super hard.PROs: - Gameplay-wise I like how accurate are boss(es) animation to the real hitbox tiggering, unlike elden ring/DS where sometimes the speed of the swing animation differs with the hitbox timing causing a hit when it shouldn't happen. This game's hitbox timing and animation is smooth and intuitive.- OST, story, concepts, arts and animation direction of this game is SO underrated, not many people talk about it, it is GREAT- Some attack avoiding mechanic that all requires a different timing like perfect dodge, resolute-strike i-frame, see through using spear/thrust stance, even repositioning using jump attack or using specific moveset is very satisfying experience rarely found in other gameCONs: - While it is up to everyone how to play the game, many boss(es) can be easily killed with a rinse-repeat well timed bonk using running smash-stance charge.- Invisible walls is necessary to keep player on track on the map especially with how complex they designed the map details, however it does make exploring tedious, can't easily see if that path is jumpable-traversable or not."
Positive,"I just finished the game today after taking my time to play it, beat it, and really digest its content. Personally, it is my favorite game in a long time, the last time was Elden Ring. I recommend this game to anyone.Thank you Game Science for the experience and memories I have built.I will research more about Chinese mythology and Buddhism."
Positive,"Finally a game that you can  actually enjoy, i always used to think maybe i am just grown up and  i can't enjoy games cause i am not so much a gamer anymore or something, but after playing this it just felt like childhood where you really got into it and just would love to play all day long grinding it. this game is factually a comeback for gaming in my opinion a breath of fresh air indeed."
Positive,Man Play Monkey Game Man Happy
Positive,"The best game I had this year so far. I have played so many game and rarely finish any of it because I become numbed by how dull and generic the game feels, but this game makes me realize what a good game should be done. You won't feel bored from the story, graphic and art are amazing, the game play is simple yet they manage to make it feels good, every NPC in this game are unique and really helps you progress through the game in many different way. There are some few time when I get frame drop here and there, and one area when my RTX 3090 can't handle the graphics, but the rest is just fine and smooth. This is the game that really appreciate your time, I don't need grinding to progress through the game, just simply play it and enjoy the story and the game. Would highly recommend it 9.8/10."
Positive,Alpha Male Approved!
Positive,"Overall: 9.5/10The legend of the monkey Wukong... I was not expecting this amazing game for sure. I came with a view of a souls like gamer, however it is not like that, you can't judge this game by the lenses of other game, you need to see it as a game of its own and that is what this game is! This is a complete game and without that petty little things companies try to put into the games to passe a ""message"" or some greedy monetization.Positives:-You can respect your whole skill tree for free and super easily that is amazing for different builds or to find a different path to defeat specific bosses.-Cloud part is so smooth, travelling in the cloud is very refreshing and well done.-NO PAID PASSES !!-Secret final super cool!-Story in a whole it is pretty interesting to me since I never saw the tales of this region, didn't know the fox tale or the Wukong story, it was a good experience and well told!-Gameplay wise it is very good, very responsive, only one or another boss attack I would say it is not so polished but for the most part the fights are truly skill based git gud kind of stuff.-Diversity of builds, you have tons of different builds to explore!Negatives-Bugged while dashing near a fall and bugged out, needed to reload the game.-Since you don't have AOE it becomes annoying to deal when there is a great number of enemies, even harder then a boss sometimes.-There are some dead zones where you will find no enemy, no material, almost nothing just an item at the end of the ""road"", it feels blend in those areas.-Achievements basically 40% you need guides, and that for me takes me out of the game... and missable items are just annoying as hell.-One or two bosses have a specific attack that it is not telegraphic and you need to do the dodge before the visual cue which was frustrating.-If you don't do the final secret boss the story ends in a blank state, however if you do the secret boss you get to see the continuation of the story for a bit until you defeat the boss and then... boom cliffhanger, but I know it will come a DLC to continue the story so that is not that bad. But being the true ending behind secret stuff and needing a guide for it, it is annoying.-Doing the 100% was boring in the last part because of the missable and the farm that you need to do for some items...Monke!"
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong return to monkey is an action pack rpg akin to god of war with a pinch of soul mechanics sprinkled in. The world is gorgeously detailed with a multitude of biomes. From lush green forests, to dry sandy deserts, sparkling snow, each filled with Buddhist iconography. Temples temples temples you will see eye popping temples devoutly crafted to the smallest detail, I can feel the Buddha watch over me as my monkey cheeks gets clapped by the next monstrous abomination. As you progress further into the game many of Wukong’s legendary abilities are earned through a multitude of challenges and secrets. Secrets you might ask? Yes secrets, this game has secrets scattered in like a Bob Ross scattering happy little trees into his painting. Now we are going into a con with the game. The levels are beautiful, but they are linear with constant invisible walls blocking your movement. As a matter of fact there is an unstuck button within your menu that you can use to get yourself out, if you are stuck between an asset such as a tree and an invisible wall. Unfortunately my monkey was in that same situation, but with the added bonus within a boss arena. So my poor monkey had to take the pounding. As you journey throughout the map you start to question whether a path you can take or an invisible wall. This will cause a player to miss a significant portion of secret locations or quests they can take on. That is the only major con to me as a player, other than that, I will continue to gush over the game. Such as the BOSSES. Oh yes, the bosses have so much variety. From slippery adversaries trying to smack me side to side. To slow moving bruisers with a single hit sending me to home run. Out of all the bosses only one boss has one unfair mechanic, where you are forced to take damage. The combat is standard press light attack, press heavy attack when opening, dodge, and use spells depending on your resource bar. There are no combos like light light heavy or heavy light light etc. It is more bare bones, but very polished, each perfect dodge a sound will pop indicating you dodged at the last possible second. Truly a neuron activation moment. Your efforts throughout the game will be dutifully rewarded with beautiful animation cut scenes at the end of each chapter. Black Myth Wukong is something done so well with so much passion from the developers you can feel their excitement for the source material with every sight and sound. I can't wait for you to start your own journey.  P.S There are women in the game."

Positive,"I am a big fan of the novel Journey to the West and I was so looking forward to this game. I have heard some bad comments from haters about this game but in reality this game is absolutely amazing even for those who are not familiar with the monkey king's lore.  The graphic is amazing, the combat feels  remarkable and the story is pretty good as well.  Give this game a try and I am sure you won't be disappointed."
Positive,"I am on my fifth playthrough now and I cannot stop playing it lol. Ever since Sekiro, I have been looking for a game that is challenging with satisfying combat experiences. Elden Ring was fun but the combat is just not as interactive and satisfying as Sekiro. And now with Black Myth: Wukong, I have finally found another game that gives such satisfying combat experiences. I would even say this game actually excels Sekiro in some aspects. I love how fast-paced the combats are, and being aggressive is actually beneficial just like Sekiro. In addition, the fact there are so many spells, spirits, transformations, stances, equipment skills available adds variety to the combat experiences. There are so many different playstyle or build to choose from and you can change your build any time. Even at my fifth playthrough, I am still discovering new ways to play the game. My favorite thing to do is to switch stances mid-battle and see-through counter with different varied combos (so satisfying when pulling it off). On top of the move variety, no two bosses are the same and every fight is just incredibly cinematic.   For people looking to start souls-like games, I would recommend starting with this one. This game is much more forgiving and easy to get into compared to actual souls games. You don't lose anything on death, you can refund and respec skill points any time you want, you have a much stronger dodge that enables dodging at last second before you get hit, and you can farm levels if you are having trouble with a boss. Besides being lenient, the game is also just very polished in every aspect. It definitely lives up to its ""overwhelmingly positive"" reputation."
Positive,One of the BEST game i have ever playedJust amazing
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong, after the Elden Ring DLC, was one of the top 3 games of 2024. What an incredible game! A hack 'n slash with soulslike elements that really captivated me. I don't regret buying it at all; on the contrary, I loved the gameplay and the story. The only downside, in my opinion, was not being able to forge the first Wukong's armor, but I have to admit, the idea of scattering the relics was brilliant. The game's optimization could be better as well, but aside from that, the game is excellent and really engaging! If you're thinking about buying it, go ahead—you won’t regret it!Dito isso...Eu vim ver o macaco"

Positive,"Writing this review after beating the final boss and sparring a bit with the secret boss.This game really surprised me. I went from being extremely excited after watching the reveal trailer to feeling quite skeptical during the preview phase, but after playing through the intro section, I was genuinely pleased. Now, having completed the entire game, my opinion remains highly positive.The game excels at nearly everything it attempts, from storytelling and presentation to graphics, score, and combat—everything is top-notch. There are a few drawbacks, such as the excessive use of invisible walls that detract from immersion and some frustrating RNG-based trophies (I checked them today to see if going for 100% was worth it, and I was disappointed. Still, I’ll give it a shot... we’ll see). Other than that, I have no major issues with the game. It runs decently on my rig (7600X/4070 Super), though performance could be slightly better.I wholeheartedly recommend this game; the way it captures Chinese mythology is stunning and feels incredibly authentic. 9/10 (will probably update after trying for 100%)"
Positive,Good old fun action game. I enjoy the more linear progression than trying to be an open world like every other game.
Positive,M O N K E
Positive,"What an amazing game. A cross between dark souls and god of war. It can be challenging at times but well worth the effort. Honestly, the story compelled me to seek out more knowledge of chinese legends and stories which made me more interested in the game story overall. 10/10"
Positive,"Best game in a long time. I think it borrowed from several different games that are also great like God of War, Jedi Survivor, and Elden Ring; and it really made a great enjoyably experience. Also, we want more games that are just games! We don't want microtransactions and pay walls. To game science, Thank you! To everyone else, take notes!"
Positive,"So far, this is my game of the decade (Space Marine 2 is around the corner tho).Incredible combat, incredible soundtrack, incredible graphics, runs super smoothly and its hella fun.Just a heads-up: this game wasn't made to appeal to western audiences specifically, there will be a loooot of stuff flying over your head if you're not familiar with the Journey to the West novel, which I find very silly for reviewers to complain about. It's very egotistical to assume every game has to be specifically made with you in mind.There's plenty of 10-15 minutes videos on youtube giving a quick recap of the original novel with all the essential info to fully enjoy the game, I highly recommend watching any of those before playing the game (the novel is really cool anyway, so it's not like it will be a slog to sit through)"

It also makes it difficult to find things when going for 100%    •Very minor graphical bugs    •Bad hitboxes on certain bosses making them WAY harder than they need to beOverall:I haven't had this much fun playing a game like this in years. It’s rare when I pick up a game and it manages to not only keep my attention past just the first couple days but also to make me deeply invested in the story, characters, and artwork. Honestly, I was surprised to see this kind of quality for China’s first-ever AAA title. It’s easily my GOTY and quite frankly, one of my top games OAT. You will not regret buying this game."

Positive,"I completed the game 100% last week (about 60 hours in), I'm on NG+4 and I just recently actually ""completed"" the game as in reaching max level, maxing all the important gear, all the important spirits, I've found every secret there is to be found, and there are still things to do (maxing every spirit/gear, reaching NG+9 which according to some people is where the stats of the enemies actually cap etc). I've tested various builds and pretty much gave everything at my disposal a try, I wanted to do all of this before writing my review.I'll be honest, at first I wanted to give this game a negative review right from the start, reason being that they are lying when it comes to the minimum/recommended system requirements. I have 2 rigs, a 3060 laptop and a 4080 pc, I Installed it first on my laptop and even tho everything on it is above the recommended system settings, I didn't got more than 20-25 FPS in the first area (higher in the other areas), this was with RT off, minimum settings, FSR on 50, on 1080p there's no way a 1060/2060 will handle this game at anything above 15-20 fps in certain areas. But then I installed it on my pc and I decided to play the game to see what the hype is all about. - They lie about the system requirements (I would say you would need at least a 3070/4060 to enjoy a decent framerate at 1080p). - The RNG drops in this game can be really really bad (sure this can be ignored if you don't plan on 100% the game, but you will be missing on certain items) - You lack the means to move faster when exploring (you get a transformation near the end of chapter 3 and a spell in chapter 6-don't wanna spoil anything- which allows you to move faster but you can only use them in those chapters, and at first it wasn't so bad but the more you play the game, especially when you're going for 100%, the more you will feel frustrated at your overall slow pace)- The large bosses in this game have janky hitboxes - Some enemy attacks can go through the terrain - The general lack of direction in chapter 6 (the only open world chapter) can be disorienting And this is pretty much all the negatives I can think of.- Combat is basic and boring you only do light attacks and a heavy attack. If you hear anyone saying this know that they haven't played this game for more than an hour and their opinion is irrelevant, either that or they don't have the mental capacity to understand the basic mechanics of the game. You have light & heavy attacks sure, you also have a staff spin attack, thrusts, parry (spell), parry + counter while attacking with heavy if you time it perfectly, dodge, perfect dodge, skills that let you go invisible and counter, immobilize, immobilize + perfect dodge if your timing is perfect, self-buffs, cast clones that later on can do coordinated attacks with you, different stances with different heavy attacks(3 basic ones which you can change at will + 1 secret one), spirits who can do massive one hits, or multiple lower-dmg hits, spirits who can block/dodge, spirits who can heal you, spirits which depending on your current light attack phase can do a different combo of their own, you can apply debuffs (freezing, poisoning, shocking or setting the enemy on fire), you can use vessels to keep your combos going, you have various transformations at your disposal with their own unique weapons and combos. Like you can literally do god-tier almost infinite combos if you know what you're doing and you have the required items, or you can dodge + parry and focus on counter-attacks and massive hits for no-hit runs, or you can literally no-brain it and just go full nuke and one shot pretty much anything even in ng+ while risking to get one-shotted yourself, or you can stack elemental debuffs on your enemies, you can literally play anyway you want. Sure there isn't a lot of weapon variety (you only get staves and spears) but you're playing as wukong.... what did you expect, twinblades?- Game is a boss-rush ... literally no, this game probably has the most amount of unique bosses BY FAR out of all the single player games, they are literally everywhere but that doesn't make it a boss rush games, people who say that either don't understand what that means or they just hate because they wanna hate. - Graphics + Soundtrack are simply 10/10, UE5 really shines in this game, and the soundtrack is just eargasm- This game has probably the best bosses out of any game ever, the sheer quantity of unique bosses is nothing short of amazing, but to take things to the next level, almost all of the bosses are incredibly fun to play against (except the large ones bc of their janky hitboxes), they offer a good challenge with varying degrees of difficulty, from very easy up to hard or very hard depending on your playstyle, level/items or experience with videogames in general. Its literally a perfect balance between quantity, quality and difficulty.- The story is really good, but what really stood out for me is the way it is presented, not everything is served on a platter, a lot of key information is presented in the form of subtle hits from dialogues (mostly from the secret bosses and quests) & from the animations we get when we finish every chapter.  The relationship between various characters in the game is absolutely mind-blowing once you figure it out (small spoilers ahead, some of your enemies are actually your allies, they are brothers who test you and guide you in this game to obtain certain items, access certain areas and become stronger, you have a lover which is never mentioned at any time during the game etc)- The animations from the end of the chapters are god-tier- They stayed true to the source material while managing to add their own twist to the tale of wukong without butchering the material, but instead enhancing it- The combat is really good, if you just figure it out....- No hand-holding. There's no real combat tutorial, no mini-map or map, no quest indicators, no quest journal, the tooltip is very basic, there's a lot of hidden maps, arenas, bosses, items that most people will just miss out. Ofc this can make some people mad at the game saying stuff like the combat is basic because they don't have the capacity of figuring stuff out, but this game lets you explore and figure out everything on your own, which is what a good game should, the experience just hits differently once you figure stuff out on your own and makes the game many times better.- Has great replayability value- Well polished, in my 84 hours of playthrough as of writing this review the only bugs I encountered were some enemy attacks that would phase through walls.- No MTXOverall I give this game a 9.5/10, and I recommend getting this game for yourself however it does come with a buyers beware because they lie about the system requirements, I would say you need at least a 3070/4060 and even then I'm unsure if you're gonna get constant 60+ fps at 1080p, but I guess you can figure this for your own pretty fast and you can always refund."
Positive,when monkey comes to save humanity. 111/100. GOTY 2024
Positive,"Monkey see, monkey do"
Positive,honestly top 3 games ive ever played. went into this thinking it would be pretty average and i was actually bewildered on how good it was. Zhu Baije is the goat dude the only pig in the world i dont hate
Positive,10/10one of the best games I have played in my lifetime. Loved everything this game had to offer :)
Positive,"TL DR: 9.2/10W:If you hold any curiosity in Chinese culture, tale of gods, the concept of ""Wu Kong"" that got abused by countless good/bad games, you should try this game. This game depict the best of the spirit ""Wu Kong"" and leave you with a tangled story for you to uncover, a good discussion of what is ""Wu Kong"".The next discussion should go to art, the art is amazing, probably the best Chinese companies have ever yield. The game play is also very fun, there are a large variety of different combination of spells to use, refund skill points are completely free. I had a great fun of thinking about builds for different bosses. This game's most similar comparison is God of War, it does a better job in a lot of aspects. you are constantly fighting mini-bosses and bosses with very little reuse of models. Character developments are amazing EXCEPT what I would discuss in the Ls.The story books tied to all normal mobs and bosses are fantastic too.English translation did a very good job, it conveys the majority of the idea of the hardest content to translate-- traditional Chinese.*** Next part contains a lot of spoilers***L:As the chosen one the you play the role of, ""you"" have limited character development, the game depict very little of your emotion, reaction to some most shocking, heart breaking, breathe taking events. other than collecting ***THE THINGS***(avoid spoiling here), you feel more like a vessel, even the real vessel feels more vivid (If you get to that fight, you will know what I mean).Quality of chapter 5 and 6 are questionable. Don't take me wrong, chapter 1 is a good starting, chapter 2, 3, 4 are amazing steady incrementing of difficulty and map puzzles, but chapter 5 feels short where you can't get to a lot of places where I think I should be able to go to and chapter 6 feels a rush to end.Camera on some bosses are aids, like really bad and annoying, some thin-leg bosses make that even worse.the hit-box on some boss registering feels not good."
Positive,"9/10A masterpiece that effortlessly blends breathtaking visuals, exhilarating combat, and a captivating narrative. From the moment I stepped into the vibrant world inspired by Journey to the West, I was completely immersed. The game's graphics are simply stunning. Every detail, from the lush forests to the intricate architectures is rendered with meticulous care. All the elements of the game: animations, cutscenes, music, UI, portraits and gameplay were equally impressive.IMO, if you want to really feel what the ""hype"" is about, then you play this game at the highest possible graphic settings (High -> Cinematic) that your PC spec allows you to.If it's not , then I would suggest to play this game maybe 5~10 years from now in which the current high-end GPUs that you can upgrade into.-----Combat/Enemy:There's no difficulty selection in this game so your experience may vary on how easy or difficult you can progress throughout chapters. But despite the struggles, I enjoyed the trial & errors from learning the combos, perfect dodge, and attack timings from boss attacks. It took me 78 hours to finish the game which includes secret locations/bosses from Chapters 1~5 (yes, including secret ending).Apparently, not all bosses were created equally, some of them were quite annoying in terms of their hit box (YEP, I'M LOOKING AT YOU ""Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master"", YOU PRICK!) but still I enjoyed trying to learn and adapt to different attack tempos, mechanics, and changing my playstyle if the situation needs to. Overall, I think 90% of the boss encounters I have good experience.Perfect dodge mechanic is what I also like about in this game, it's a high-risk high-reward kind of maneuver to pull because you need to get hit before you dodge NOT dodging before you get hit kind of thing, it gives me the sense of fulfillment when everytime I am learning the attack timings from the boss. Alternatively, there are different staff skills/stance that allows you to parry or dodge which varies from your playstyle.Transformations were also really cool! Although I only used quite few of them because of personal preferences with their added buffs.The armors and weapons are fairly balanced in this game some of them are situational or will vary to your playstyle and some armor gives unique effect without having to wear a set. But overall it's really good.Story:The game's story adapted from the ""Journey to the West"" novel but not in its entirety, you don't really need to read the novel to understand what the story is about since this game takes a different route for its own franchise hence part of the name ""Black Myth"", atleast from what I've observed, this game takes place after the events in the novel + some twists.The animation & cutscenes really exceeded my expectations, it has a balance amount of cutscenes from actual gameplay and it gives you that immersion to Chinese mythologies.Exploration:The level design is god-tier, every detail is meticulously created from lush forests to intricate architectures, it's just simply stunning.Also, I cant' stress this enough but exploring really pays off in this game! It will either reward you an upgrade or a secret boss encounters so definitely a huge W for people who are into exploration.----Overall, despite my experience of playing the game in a lower than 60 FPS (and mostly unstable), I think it really outweighs the level of effort that the game developers have poured into this game in terms of ""next-gen"" graphics, they really pushed the limits of Unreal Engine 5 to the point that there are technical limitations from the game engine itself. My commendation is not only solely to the graphics but to other aspects of the game as well the quality of animation, cutscenes, music, and level design they have delivered exceeds expectations.This is a must-play for fans of action-adventure games and Chinese mythology. It's a game that will leave a lasting impression for its breathtaking visuals, exhilarating combat, and a captivating narrative."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is an ambitious and visually stunning action RPG that has garnered a lot of attention for its breathtaking graphics and challenging gameplay. Developed by GameScience, the game draws inspiration from the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, offering a unique cultural backdrop that sets it apart from many other games in the genre.Visuals and AtmosphereOne of the standout features of Black Myth: Wukong is its gorgeous visuals. The game world is richly detailed, with environments that range from lush forests to eerie, otherworldly realms. Each area is meticulously crafted, making exploration a visual treat. The character designs, especially the various mythical creatures and bosses, are equally impressive and add to the game’s immersive atmosphere.Gameplay and CombatThe combat in Black Myth: Wukong is both challenging and rewarding. Players take on the role of The Destined One, a monkey warrior on a quest to find six relics of Wukong. The game features a variety of combat styles and abilities, allowing players to adapt their approach to different enemies and situations. Boss fights are particularly noteworthy, offering intense and strategic battles that require skill and patience to overcome.Story and CharactersWhile the game’s story is rooted in Journey to the West, it can be somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow for those unfamiliar with the source material. The narrative is divided into six self-contained chapters, each culminating in a beautifully animated vignette that tells a short story about the chapter’s main antagonist. However, the main storyline and character development can feel lacking at times, leaving players wanting more depth and clarity.Technical IssuesDespite its many strengths, Black Myth: Wukong is not without its flaws. The game has been reported to suffer from technical issues, including crashes, bugs, and performance problems, even on high-end PCs. These issues can be frustrating and detract from the overall experience, but they do not completely overshadow the game’s many positive aspects.ConclusionIn summary, Black Myth: Wukong is an incredibly engaging and visually spectacular action RPG that offers a unique and challenging experience. While it has its share of technical and narrative shortcomings, the game’s stunning visuals, satisfying combat, and rich cultural setting make it a worthwhile adventure for fans of the genre."
Positive,"This might be the best game I've played in my life. Fluid and responsive combat, beautiful story telling with attention to dialogue, and absolutely amazing graphics as well as soundtrack."
Positive,"At time of this review, I have finished the game with 100% achievements. I have experienced pretty much everything this game has to offer. This is without a shadow of a doubt my GOTY. However, this is not a perfect game in my book, in fact it is far from one. Overall, I will give the game a solid 9/10, for the following reasons: Graphics: 10/10, this is the single best looking game you can find on the market. From scenery to character design, it definitely pushed UE5 to its limit. The game also offered you various ways to have a closer look at the scenes, as well as very nicely crafted cut scenes and animations. Acoustics: 10/10, this game offers a huge amount of soundtracks that seamlessly blended into the gameplay, and good music can bring you to tears at the right time, speaking from my very personal experience.Stories: 9.5/10, each chapter of the game brings a thrilling yet thought-provoking little story that has huge amount of references to ""Journey To The West"". You do not need to know much about the lore to get a general idea about the game, but this does not mean the lore of the game is any simple. All enemies and characters offer a story page, and putting them together reveals a lot of hidden stuff. However, I have to remind English players that I understand Chinese, I think the translation, though did the best job they can, may have simplified a lot of stuff if you don't read carefully. You may have a cheap impression of the stories, only because stuff on the surface are not thoroughly presented. Combat: 9.5/10, a game with innovative mechanics, very cleverly designed to not only reflect the mythology of the character, but also fun to play. I don't think you can find any game that are similar to this game combat-wise. It really just learns all the advantages of soul/god-of-war kind of game and creates something new. Map Design: 5/10, as much as I like this game, the map design fell short by quite a large margin. Namely, they block the area that they don't want you to access, but without any visual pattern you can learn from. Some rocks are jump-able and some are not; some cliffs are fall-able and some are not. This really forces me to try every edge and eventually pumped into pretty much every invisible wall. This really ruined the immersion. There are a lot of other detail that showed how inexperienced the devs are. For example, after so many impressive and novel design of boss fight, all of a sudden there is that one boss that they directly rip off from Elden Ring; a lot of the hit-boxes of enemy are so awkwardly shaped that you cannot hit them without using specific type of combat style. However, this is not to take away the stunning and exciting journey this game has to offer. This game is worth its full price and I'm sure it will offer at least 40-70 hours of purest joy."
Positive,SO FAR THE BEST GAME IN 2024 !
Positive,"A flawed but painstakingly crafted love-letter to Chinese mythology and the ancient Journey to the West novel.Pros:- Incredibly detailed world-building - every character and enemy gets a portrait, poem, and short story, and they're all delightful.- Extremely high quality boss design - Absurd quantity of said bosses- Standout visuals and art direction- Great voice acting (play in Mandarin)- Rewarding exploration - so many secret areas, some genuinely epic highlights that some players could just missCons:- Overarching story is a bit plain- Combat system is quite shallow. Fun, but shallow. There is room for some skill expression, but it's very often not required.People might argue that some other very popular games like Elden Ring also have shallow combat systems, but they are different games. Elden Ring is an action RPG that allows for more build variety and encourages different approaches to combat. This is first and foremost a character action game, and when compared to others in the same genre (think DMC5, Stellar Blade, Ninja Gaiden) it falls short. You will be repeating the same button input for most of the game, and the animation will be the same for most of the game.- Level design leaves a lot to be desired! Be prepared for a great deal of confusion about where you can go and where you can't (invisible walls galore). The emphasis on photorealism can sometimes mean that visual cues are not very obvious. You'll probably get a lost a fair bit as you explore, and there's a fair bit of backtracking to do as well.Overall, I'd definitely recommend. It's a great game, but it sadly falls a little short in some areas that prevent it from reaching true greatness."
Positive,"4 years ago when the first trailer got released, at first glance there was this feeling that this game was going to be amazing, especially due to the developers taking their time to finish the game. Now that it is finally here, it is one of few games nowadays that could live up to the hype and gave everyone what they wanted and more.It is absolutely amazing from start to finish, the graphics are outstanding, the story is good, the music is beautiful and it does the source material justice. The combat is very well done, unlike with other souls-like games where it can feel clunky/akward, there is a real flow to the combat. This flow is partly possible due to the lack of a block/parry mechanic. The logical flow in movement makes the difficulty of the game very doable, as you can simply react instead of needing to learn patterns - therefore you will be able to do most fights in the first or second try. The general consensus is that there are about 5 fights which are truly difficult from the 100 bosses it has.To complete about 40-ish hours is needed, depending on if you pick everything up along the way; don't miss out on missable content and how you fair against all the boss fights."
Positive,Challenging but addictive!2 Thumbs up!!
Positive,"The game is hard, but not as punishing as Dark Souls.The bosses difficulty sometimes can varies from ""I can button mash and dodge, and succeeded in killing the boss on my first try"" to ""I can't dodge at the right time and just wasted the window of opportunity to attack, and I die to relentless attacks when the boss is on low health, I don't want to play this game anymore"".The map has breathtaking view, but the level designs can be better, sometimes there are invisible walls and you will have no idea where to go next, but this is only far and few if you are those who like to explore every inch of the maps."
Positive,This is the best non Fromsoft souls-like.  My personal GOTY 2024.
Positive,"When this game was first shown to the public, I thought it was definitely getting canceled. The second time they showed it, I thought it was just another generic cash grab attempt. The third time, I thought it was too good to be true. When it got released I had no intention of checking it out, but the amount of hype and news surrounding it made me buy the game 2 days after release thinking ""if it's bad I'll just refund"". After playing through just the intro, I decided it wasn't getting refunded no matter what.In recent years, the gaming landscape feels crowded with sequels, reboots, remasters, remakes, uninspired and unoriginal crap close to or straight up plagiarism and potential successes plagued by performance/compatibility issues and terrible practices like microtransactions, lootboxes, live service models, focus on meeting marketing deadlines instead of delivering finished and polished games, etc. It's been so hard to find something to play that I recently loaded up Far Cry 6 just so I could mindlessly shoot things while having some laughs with my friends about how bad the game is (while still managing to be more fun than most other modern games).For me, Black Myth: Wukong stands out as a refreshing entry in the industry, as an action/adventure game with hack and slash combat that punishes you if you attempt to just button mash, blending elements of souslike while having actual lore, cinematic cutscenes and being accessible to casual players, and presenting us with a story rooted in Chinese mythology that we haven't seen before in any large game and is unknown to many westerners, very different from the usual hero against villain we've grown used to.I should say in advance that this game is far from perfect, and it's also not unique in any way (aside from being the first AAA from China). Why then is it highly and widely praised, already among my favorite games of all time and deserving of the Game of the Year award? I think it's because it excels in almost every single aspect, and it's also one of the few recent AAA games that really feels polished and finished on launch. It isn't trying to copy anything, it isn't trying to be something it isn't, there is no unnecessary stuff that makes you think ""why is this even in the game?"".The storytelling is immersive, with amazing voice acting (at least in English and Chinese). At first it looks like the classic journey of growth and redemption after the hero's downfall, but you soon realize it is told in a more darker and natural tone, with your character having it's flaws pointed out and frowned upon constantly both by your opponents and allies. You're not the typical hero  (heck, you're not even the Monkey King, you're just a monkey which might be destined to fulfill Sun Wukong's path, and depending on your actions during the game you fail and the cycle just continues until another monkey is able to complete the journey).  At the end of each chapter you get a cutscene, some look like modern animes, some look like something from Studio Ghibli, and some are claymation, which gives a nice touch to the story.The graphics are simply amazing, it's one of the best looking games out there along with Alan Wake 2 and Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. Full Ray Tracing is amazingly implemented, and so are the upscaling technologies. Performance is surprisingly stable and optimized. For some reason it's missing proper HDR support, making some areas burn your retina with excessive brightness while other areas are pitch dark. I've seen a lot of people complaining about the forced DOF and low-res textures blended in the high-res world. While I'm against the lack of customizable options, i think the DOF in this game could be perfect if toned down just a bit, and even the low-res textures have a place in the game, since it creates a sense of depth in the scene. You can easily recognize what is playable ground and what is just filling the scenario, you can differentiate between important places and places you can't even reach, and if everything had the same amount of detail the world would just be a overly sharp mess.The level design is the only weak point in my opinion, but I'm used to FromSoftware games, so that's tough competition, and I don't know how it compares to similar games in the genre since I don't usually play them. The world is beautifully crafted, but you can't explore it that much. I don't mind the invisible walls since it's not an open world game, but they could definitely be better placed. The chapters are pretty linear, sometimes you will be offered at most two different paths, but these paths loop around and lead you to the same place in the end.Soundtrack is good, sometimes you don't pay much attention to it, sometimes it enhances the atmosphere, and sometimes it completely steals the show like  the Headless Monk in Chapter 2, the Yaksha King fight, the moments leading up to obtaining Jingubang in the cave, The Great Sage's Broken Shell fight, etc. The gameplay is fluid, with a challenging but fair difficulty. The combat is dynamic and fast paced, but you still have to pay attention to your resources and the enemies actions. There are a lot of unlockable skills, three different staff instances that serve different purposes, a few spells that require planning to use or you just waste your mana and cooldowns, different equipments that can alter your playstyle, and consumables that can give you the edge in a battle when you feel the boss is simply stronger than you. Removing the staff throw was a bad decision since we're left with zero ranged attacks.The game has a nice pace, at no point I felt tired, bored, or stuck. The narrative is layered and ensures you stay invested throughout the whole thing. I wasn't familiar at all with Journey to the West (aside from the Monkey King character), but now I feel like consuming more media related to it. The game has 2 endings, and I find both are perfect.  The first one (called the Bad Ending) is the default one and has the player monkey character fight the Stone Monkey and The Great Sage's Broken Shell (which are the mindless and spiritless body of the original Sun Wukong), only to find out you accomplished the same success but also the same failures, having the golden headband fitted in your head and taking the broken shell's place, awaiting until the true destined monkey fulfills Sun Wukong's destiny. The second ending (called the True Ending) requires you to complete a lot of optional tasks and fight Erlang, which is presented in the very first scene of the game as an archnemesis, and as a result you unveil some truths about both his intentions and Sun Wukong's actions. The monkey recovers all of Sun Wukong's memories, and ends up rejecting the golden headband, finally uniting all of the six relics and proving to be indeed the Destined One, rising again as Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, and leaving room for an expasion or a second game. Black Myth: Wukong somehow managed to surpass it's expectations which were already extremely high, and it should set a new benchmark for future games in the genre. Shoutout to the developers who started it as a passion project and made their first public showcase as a means of attracting more people to the team instead of trying to sell an unfinished product.tl;dr: reject buddhahood, return to monkey"
Positive,Game Of The Year <3
Positive,the best game
Positive,*** 9.5 *** ถ้ามีแผนที่ กับ parry เอาไป 10 10 10เป็นเกมที่รู้สึกซื้อแล้วคุ้มในรอบปีกว่าๆ
Positive,Holy f**K WOW 10/10  got the secret ending too. what an experienve. not for the faint of heart
Positive,"After finishing the game with 100% of achievements, I can definitely say that the game lives up to the hype and I highly recommend playing this game. Of course, there are a few flaws that I shall mention, but overall I've had a great time playing. It looks amazing, the combat is fun and smooth and the story managed to get me emotional at certain points. My final score for this game is 9/10.Regarding performance, I had to play on medium settings, since I ran the game with an i7-6700 processor, 16 GB RAM and a Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070 graphics card, which is far from ideal. But with the right settings, the game ran smoothly most of the time and even on medium settings it still looks quite good. I've only had one crash on day 1 and a bit of stuttering during the prologue. Other than that, there were no issues. The story takes place after the events from Journey to the West. I won't spoil the events that take place in the game, but at the end of each chapter we get cutscenes related to the story of that chapter, each one being done in a different animation style. Also, there are different endings to the game. The path we follow in the game is, for the most part, quite linear, but it has enough branching paths and secret areas so it doesn't feel boring, or like we are stuck on rails. The environments we explore over the course of the game are quite varied, ranging from forests, deserts, frozen lakes and mountains, labyrinthine caves, volcanic mountains. Regarding exploration, I've seen some people complaining about the lack of a map, but personally I haven't felt lost or like I would have required help orienting myself, perhaps with the exception of the final chapter, that takes place in an open area. My biggest complaint about exploration and navigation is that there are invisible walls (which is understandable, since it's not an open world), but sometimes it's difficult to tell if something is inaccessible or the path to a potential secret area. When in doubt, just bonk all the fences I guess. But other than this, I've had no issues with this part of the game.The game is an Action RPG, with challenging combat (still, it feels a lot easier than a souls-like in my opinion) and plenty of bosses to fight. There are, in fact, over 90 different bosses and mini bosses that we can encounter in the game and they have different looks and move sets (yes, there are few frog bosses that only differ through their elemental type, but even fighting those is worth it in the end), so combat will not get stale.  By doing the secret areas in each chapter, you get an item that can make the final boss of said chapter a lot easier. For example, gain flame immunity against the first one, or cancel one of their abilities. Of course acquiring these items and using them is optional, so if you prefer a harder encounter, you still have that option.Regarding combat, it is fluid and responsive, with light/heavy attacks and combos, three stances, transformations and varied spells. The skill tree is generous with its options and re-allocating skill points is free, so experimenting with different builds is encouraged. Stats and resistances can be boosted through alchemy after you meet a certain character and you can reallocate these points whenever you want.Armor sets give certain bonuses which buff various play styles. Equipment progression is mostly linear, at least to a certain point where you gain the option to upgrade older sets of armor, which allows you to continue using the bonuses you prefer. There is only one weapon type, the staff, but there are spears that can be obtained and they have a somewhat different move set.The mini bosses we fight can be absorbed and used in combat, each one gives a passive buff and a brief transformation that executes their signature attack.Now, regarding my main issues with the game... As I've said above, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether  you will hit an invisible wall or start down hidden path.Chapter 4 in particular has a lot of secret content that can be accidentally missed, which can be quite frustrating if you are a completionist. The game requires playing through NG+ anyway if you want to 100%, so I guess it's not that much of an issue, but it's still annoying. For example, to unlock the secret area (that contains missable stuff too, of course), you need to fight an optional boss twice. But during the first encounter, that boss can drop a piece of armor that is needed for the achievement. It only drops that item IF you attack it from behind and break 4 of its arms. If you accidentally kill the boss before that, you are unable to obtain the item in that playthrough.And the final complaint, which again matters only if you want to 100%: the drop rates for seeds and armor pieces are a bit too low in my opinion. Sure, it depends on RNG and luck, but I spent 2 full days trying to farm the last type of seed I needed for the [Seed to Sow] achievement. And that is while wearing the items that boost drop rates too. And for this reason alone I give it a 9/10 instead of a 9.5/10 like it would otherwise deserve."
Positive,Im monkey with a stick 10/10
Positive,"Years ago we had the opportunity and pleasure to play video games based on Greek, Egyptian and Norse mythology and this time we finally got something fresh and in my experience and taste, Asian mythology is the richest in stories and imagination. There is wisdom and adventure in every written segment. After this game I would love to see Indian and Slavic mythology and as a gamer, my heart would be full."
Positive,"As a Chinese, after playing through Black Myth: Wukong, I have a few suggestions for those interested in its story line and cultural elements:first of all, do not try to understand all the elements in the game, its fking impossible. i.e., monsters(yaoguai) could quote Confucius(Decayed wood cannot be carved), etc.2. Don't start by reading the novel Journey to the West; it's long and challenging to understand. It  incorporates a lot of Chinese philosophical thought (such as Buddhist and Taoist ideas) and can be interpreted from many angles including political and cultural perspectives, each offering a completely different yet plausible explanation. If you want to quickly understand Journey to the West, just watch the 1986 TV series by the same name. After watching it, playing the game will give you a completely different experience. 3. Chinese language tends to be implicit. Simply put, it's often indirect, this tend to happens in a collectivist society, especially China. For example, highly-rated Chinese dramas often involve a lot of implicit expression, meaning they don't directly state viewpoints or phenomena(you have to analyze the hided meaning behind the script). House of Cards as a US drama, fits well with what I consider a typical preference among Chinese people. So, when playing the game or watching the show, you might try to analyze the logic and motives behind each sentence.I'll give a hint here:   you may find that some monsters knows Wukong had a position in the ""haven"", this type of monster usually call Wukong ""horses keeper/protector""(Wukong was assigned a job alike cowboy(horse-boy) in haven), when they call Wukong horseboy, Wukong usually wont fight em directly. instead, Wukong will try find some help from haven(to see who is the ""owner"" or ""master"" of the monster), eventually, the monster will back to the haven. however, the ending of most monsters without background is DEATH."
Positive,"Jogo incrivel, perfeito, zerei após 54 horas, aproveitei cada cantinho do jogo"
Positive,Obligatory - Return to Monke.
Positive,"I can see why the reviews are ""Overwhelmingly Positive"". The art, the story, the combat.. everything about this game is incredible!"
Positive,Master piece and GOTY
Positive,"First of all, the game is Feature-Complete, unfortunately this is rare nowadays with big games.One time buy and no microtransactions.The amount of different enemies is absurd: 90 mobs, 55 sub bosses, 26 bosses.You can make at least 8 different builds.There is a secret ending (true ending).NG+ enables new items.At the end of each chapter there is an animation with different styles.The combat is sensational super incredible because of the incredible work with the animations of everything in this game.In my humble opinion, this game is GOTY!!!"
Positive,"Wukong is a project brimming with passion, and you can truly feel the love and dedication that went into creating this game. It sets a new standard, leaving you questioning how other companies are using their vast resources. An incredible experience from start to finish; is a must-play for everybody."
Positive,"This game is nothing short of a breathtaking experience. From the moment you step into its richly detailed world, you can feel the care and craftsmanship that went into every aspect of the game. The visuals are stunning, with environments that are not only beautiful but also incredibly immersive. Each location is meticulously designed, drawing inspiration from Chinese mythology in a way that feels both authentic and fantastical.The combat system is a standout feature, offering a perfect blend of challenge and satisfaction. Every encounter feels meaningful, requiring skill and strategy rather than button-mashing. The variety of enemies keeps the gameplay fresh, and the boss battles are nothing short of epic, each one a unique test of your abilities.But what truly elevates ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is its storytelling. The narrative is deep and engaging, weaving together familiar tales from ""Journey to the West"" with fresh twists that keep you hooked from start to finish. The protagonist, Sun Wukong, is brought to life with a complexity and depth that makes his journey all the more compelling.Had a blast so far, highly recommended."
Positive,the most complete/bug free /well runing/smooth and crisp combat/ amazing graphics game i have played in a long long long time!i almost forgot how a complete product feel`s in this industry!

Positive,HAVE BEEN A WHILE SINCE THE LAST TIME SOMETHING GOT ME STUCK ON THE CHAIR LIKE THIS
Positive,"I'll be honest, I don't normally post reviews I'm just a lurker. It's been many, many years since I've played a singleplayer title to its 100% completion, I usually call it quits if I'm not sold within the first 30 mins to an hour.I've now finished BM: Wukong to its entirety with 100% achievements completed; it's one of the best titles for me for the past decade."
Positive,Glory to the CCP
Positive,apes together strong
Positive,"Ok so... MONKEE.  This game feels fresh from the getgo, these last years the ""souls like"" genre has expanded so much that somehow I felt saturated. Wukong on the other hand, brings the action hack n' slash that was a little bit forgotten. To be honest, the closest the game does feel is an in between Bayonetta on Hard / Darksiders II without the looting system. It works damn good. Visuals are god lovely, the enviroments, all foes and everything feels made with details and care, you do not see repetitive textures. Combat, as mentioned before, is fluid, fast, the game does not feel hard, it has it's challenge yes but not neerly to a souls level and THAT'S totally fine because you feel the heat of the action, you do not have to worry about your ""souls / rune"" progress or something if you fail. There's a good bunch of moves and spells at your disposal to wreck anything. Story, well... This is the story that inspired the original Dragon Ball. (Also, there is a Waifu, Diversity is... you have a god damn Zoo! do not believe you know who on X )About performance. Few framedrops but also, not a single crash, have not encountered major bugs, the game runs very good. I do use DLSS with 90 scaling for 90/120 ish 1440p on a 3070 / 7700X CPU, some ultra and other high options."

Positive,I think he could beat Goku
Positive,ADHD Friendly Review :-1. Stunning world & Character design2. Level design could be a bit better (Too many POIs) at any given instance)3. Beginner/Intermediate friendly boss design (Very few hard bosses)4. Amazing soundtracks5. Gorgeous storytelling (Simple & easy to follow) 6. Fluid & Responsive combat7. Very poor lighting in a lot of areas (can go from darkness to sudden flashbangs on the screen)Overall :- 9/10
Positive,"This is an action game, it is not souls like.Strong points:-great combat, the skills in the talent tree are fun to use and you can do some beautiful combos. I thought that the god of war abilities were insane for it's time but black myth raised the bar in that aspect. People should focus on beating the bosses with style.-Some bosses have great mechanics that you dont see often.-crazy graphics. The character details and their armors look insane. The only thing that makes you remember that you're in a game and not some cgi game trailer is when the items clip in each other.-a lot of content-great progression systemCons:-bosses are very inconsistent. While it's nice that there is a lot of content some bosses are very worthless and dont really bring anything to the game. I know that a lot of them are there so you can collect an ability or materials but it's way too many bosses bro. Diverse but too easy.-The levels are meh, and the environment seems a little too overcrowded also the design is forgettable.-story is confusing. Maybe I am just stupid but I have no idea what is happening. Obviously I know the objectives but I dont understand everything that they are saying or referring to. Heard that if you know the lore it's good tho.Probably my favorite game/dlc this year. The combat is something else/"
Positive,"So far the game has been a fun experience and i could easily recommend it. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous, it was a pleasant surprise that the game's performances runs as well as it should. The sound effects and music has been on point to make you feel immerse in the mythological setting. The gameplay has been pretty good, dodging feels fluid and attacking have a nice responsive feeling. Most of the bosses i have encountered have been pretty unique each with different movesets that it feels refreshing and fun when you encounter a new boss. The characters and story so far has been pretty intriguing, the lore especially has been pretty good in introducing newcomers to the mythology while for others who are already familiar, with references and tie in to the original sources material.For the negatives i have is the environmental and map design can get pretty confusing especially after chapter 2 and the lack of map contributes to me often being lost although that could be my horrible sense of direction. Lastly, the placement of the invisible walls after act 1 can be quite jarring as i have encounter paths that i thought could be traverse while other times i missed a path thinking that there is an invisible wall there. Anyway, monkey game gud."
Positive,一周目能体验的都体验了+二周目速通了前两章之后更新一下整体体验还就是个7/10（感觉客观讲略低于7但是有西游加成可以打7分）- 战斗系统还是有几处瑕疵，但是整体还可以- 凡是非人形怪，锁定都大有问题，经常出现打不到得情况；boss战是双boss的也是，没法自由切换锁定；说到锁定，盘丝洞那个吊茧独木桥也是典中典，感觉没人没在那里被战斗机制问题坑死过- 大石敢当是我玩类似游戏遇到的设计最愚蠢的boss，没有之一- 第六章刚拿到筋斗云很兴奋，但是第六章的地图巨空，啥也没有，几个boss的设计感觉非常敷衍，根本不像是终章的神兽boss应该有的水平，在巨大的地图上乱飞找那几个怪真的很无聊- 杨戬和大圣残躯打起来还有点意思，最后变身巨兽处决四大天王真的爽飞了；寅虎老老实实背板+识破过了，很有成就感- 任务道具概率掉落且没有保底实在是弱智设计- 全成就要装备概率掉落也就算了，种子居然也是概率掉，而且刷新时间跟现实世界时间也有关系，很蠢- 前两章剧情非常好，精彩的合理改编，第三章感觉一般般，第四章要玩到结尾才知道八戒跟蜘蛛精的前缘，八戒对妖精有色欲我觉得很符合原著，但是玩的过程种确实一头雾水，如此有争议的情节还搞这一套就不太好了- 其他剧情方面，三打旧日爱人什么意思啊，不会真是有白骨精恋爱剧情吧，这个实在接受不了；杨戬那句，你不在的日子我一直在想你，真给我整得绷不住了，只能善意揣测一下，也许编剧原意不是那个方面的意思吧；四妹支线没头没尾，如果没有四妹dlc那这个剧情纯sb---20h体验如下---美术无敌，3D模型细节以及原型考证可以看出下了巨量功夫战斗系统很棒，很有扮演孙悟空战斗的感觉地图和关卡设计，啥中啥比中比，对于一个喜欢舔图的玩家来说太折磨了。而且这游戏还又很多隐藏道具和关卡，其实是鼓励你去探图的，但是看起来能过去的地方，十个有九个过不去。至今不能理解为什么空气墙的对面你要放一大片空地，看起来能过去的样子。而且每张图都有十万甚至九万个这样的边界点位，真想把关卡设计师的琴码关在地图边缘的空气墙后面。这时不得不感慨魂的地图是真好啊，，，既然是箱庭游戏那就把箱庭的边界刻画清楚好不好。综合一下，7/10（地图最多2/10）另外第三章开始掉帧非常严重，本人i5-13400F+4070，前两章全程4k锁60帧无压力，第三章见到龙之后疯狂掉帧，看了眼贴吧发现4090的哥们也在吐槽见龙掉帧，那应该是游戏的问题
Positive,"One of the best stories so far, didn't even skip a single cutscene, hats of to the devs to making this game really interesting. This game brought me even closer to Buddhism, i am so proud of the devs as a Buddhist eventhough my buddhism is different from chinese buddhism the morales of all those stories give the same values as we are taught n our part of the world. Bravo and i hope you make similar games in the future."

Positive,Very good game (maybe GOTY ??)
Positive,My social credit is skyrocketing right now
Positive,"Amazing journey, amazing game, what a story...just dont forget to do your secret quests :)"
Positive,"9.5/10 - Nearly FlawlessBest game to come out this year so far. If you are a fan of fromsoft games then you will be a fan of this game. It's more alignment to jedi fallen order or jedi survivor if you have played those. The combat is great, a lot of variety with different stance and builds you can use. The level design is also great with plenty of hidden areas that aren't the hardest to find but certainly add to the game. The bosses are all unique (outside of the frogs). The only negative is that the final act is open ended with no sense of direction truly, and in that act it would truly benefit from a mini map. That's the only thing that takes away from this being a flawless master piece."
Positive,Visuals: WonderfulCombat: Fun and hardYou don't lose your Will (souls) upon death. You may also visit older parts of the game.
Positive,Game is good but 90% dodge 10% attack
Positive,"Excellent graphics, will break most cards (even 40 series on higher res), great game play - one of my first ""souls like"" games and having a great time xD"
Positive,"What a journey this game has been. One of the most fun experiences I've had in a game in a long time, and I genuinely recommend that anyone who enjoys action RPGs should try this game."
Positive,"Without a doubt, after more than 20 hours of playing Black Myth, I can proudly say that this game deserved to be the Game of the Year even before it earned the title. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience that pulls you away from reality and immerses your senses in a world of refined art and creativity, leaving you captivated by every moment spent in this enchanting universe."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a stunning triumph from Game Science, blending breathtaking graphics, fluid combat, and innovative mechanics into a standout experience. With its immersive gameplay and remarkable visual detail, it’s a strong contender for Game of the Year."
Positive,Its been a long time since i really enjoyed a singleplayer game. It is TERRIFIC.
Positive,Hands down 2024 game of the year contender!!!

Positive,"Played this game for 23 hours as I write this review. Last few months there was a lot of negative news about this game. While playing this game, I realize how much dog sheeeet those journalist write. It seems like if they wrote a review with their head in their own butt hole, so it is understandable why their review says nothing about the game. Their reviews were mainly to push their ideology regarding diversity.Real review about the game:I think this game is awesome in every aspect, the graphics are overwhelming, there is a lot of option to play around with stat points, you can make a skill unique to your taste by giving it skillpoints and the story is really awesome. This story is comparable with gods of war, but of course less gore in gameplay. Battlestyle is comparable with Elden Ring, but faster pace combat. This game for certain is battling for top 3 game of the year. My personal preference is to say this is the best game of the year or even last 5 years.Only downside that I can think about are the invisible walls, but to a certain extend I do understand why they have to put invisible walls. Else the area will be too heavy on your pc or ps5, and cause more FPS drops. You do require a decent pc for this game, or try to lower the graphics.Tips:In case your pc is not that great, please play the game with lower settings. Please do not think like a certain group of people that nonetheless what pc you have, you deserve to play the game at the highest settings. This just shows how dumb you are and neglect recommended requirements. In case you want the game to run better, try play it on 1080P with super resolution on 70-100 to maintain the quality of graphics."
Positive,"For those who say the game lacks diversity, there is ‘Black’ in the title"
Positive,banger of a monkussy
Positive,great game 100%
Positive,I would give this game a thumbs up. I started to play this game on steam deck. After the long download I could finally press play. When I got in the game I was met with another download process. When I got to 70% my game crashed. It kept happening until I changed to proton experimental.  I was able to play the game. It was really laggy. I then exited. Then came back and the game just crashed every single time. Something about validating. I Uninstalled the game then reinstalled it again and started to play a semi laggy version of the game. I then messed with the settings and got the game to work smoothly. It's fun but minor time stops here and there. It's a good game tho.
Positive,So Just To Check This Game Is NOT A Soul Game Right?.
Positive,Almost 20 hours in and I am still on chapter two this game is literally consuming my life in all of the best possible ways. Buy it.

Positive,Monkey of the year 🐒👍
Positive,"I'm almost with 6 hours in the game and these are my thoughts so far:- The gameplay is pretty simple. Just smash the X button in the controler, roll with B and from time to time, use some spells to make some battles easier.- The whole game is beautiful. If you're playing on Ultra with Ray Tracing on, you may feel some frame drops, but nothing that affects the gameplay. All the scenarios are stunning.- It's not a soulslike game, in my opinion. It's more of a hack n' slash, considering the first item that I mentioned. Not something good or bad, just an information for the ones expecting some sort of Sekiro or Elden Ring. It's not. But it doesn't mean that you won't face any troubles in the boss battles.- It's not open world as some people were saying. It's pretty linear.- So far, the moveset of the enemies doesn't have a big difference among them. Again, I'm almost with 6 hours of gameplay, finished chapter 1 and explored a lot of chapter 2. Maybe there'll be more different enemies after, we'll see.In the overall: this game is really good. You should definitely try it."

Positive,"Im Chinese but im using English cuz I just want the world to know that this game is epic!! Im on fourth chapter now so far so good. Love the concept love the npcs' love the background music. Everyone enjoy !!! Wukong is always a badass character in Chinese history. I'm super excited that finally, FINALLY some studio in China made a game that it's not ALL ABOUT MONEY. jesus FINALLY. Congrats btw to be the global top sellers NO.1."

Positive,Return to monke
Positive,"i like when the monkey hits stuff and goes ""ook!""edit: beat the game. 11 bananas out of 10"
Positive,"So. hola! As one of the fans of Journey to the West, I was excited when I heard about this title. Sun Wukong myth is one of the most widely known in the world, yet no cool game came out about him before, but here we come!  If you're soul-like fan I won't say that you will get the same experience, after all its a bit distant from dark souls.It took all the best from soul-likes, their waypoint system and boss-fights and thrown away most of the things made 'just for difficulty'. I haven't completed the game yet, but boss-fights clearly made to be exiting. You can feel a pressure from them, yet bosses don't cheat as their fellow dark souls residents. So, you might find those boss-fights a bit easy. Exploration feels more like a slasher, than souls-like, it's just an action, you will rarely die on your way to the next boss. Which leads to my next point.This is a great action RPG with excellent narration. It is different from souls-likes as they are, yet it is even more enjoyable. I enjoyed it much more than any souls-like I played after all. I'm not your NG-25 fella, though, so don't take it to the heart. Soul-like elements are pretty light.You won't lose anything from dying. You won't gain a lot from grind too, though it is viable, if you for some reason can't beat it.What I love the most was introduction and depiction of Sun Wukong, yet it is pure action all the time. No climbing, no wandering among countless mobs or places made just to be annoying. It is fun.Black Myth is a great Action RPG. So, I recommend it as a game in general. No wonder it got so hyped. If not for my responsibilities I would've played it over night. I swear I needed just another try to kill this bear, he barely lived though my first try!"
Positive,"The time has come! After waiting more than 2 years for this game it's time for an objective review about it. The game looks amazing, just wanted to point that out if you didn't see it from the screenshots, or videos, or leaks, it actually is using path-traced lightning and shadows. What does that mean? say bye bye to frames! XD, with everything set to maxim my system manages around 40 fps (on 1440p resolution) and it also is not the smoothest experience. Now when we disable rtx, well then it's another story. I am mostly in the 70 fps cap DLSS on DLAA mode, so it's really playable, and it looks amazing. The fights, the story, read the novel, loved it, played this for 3 hours, loved it, so I see no negatives here. I can describe this game as a soft soulslike combined with God of War, which is crazy cool! Sound design (playing the game in Chinese) is also solid, with some great voice acting and epic music. I really think this game can win the best game of the year title. It was worth the wait for me!"
Positive,"Great game. I'll simply list a list (lol) of pros and cons:     Very streamlined Action RPG/Hack and Slash experience, even if you are bad at this kind of games, just don't forget to breath. The game likes when you don't buttonmash     Visuals are stunning and have a style. Some areas might feel dark so just tweak your brightness if needed.     Music and voice acting (Play with Chinese voice btw) are both ear candies.      Story is exactly what you expect. A myth, a legend. A fairytale, if you want. No modern bs. Also, the monke.     Performance is weird. One time you open up the game and it works with no framedrops and in *silky smooth* framerate, another time you may encounter a weird bug with 10 fps cap. I don't know what causes that but it solves itself with a restart.     Invisible walls     If you preordered the game - you can't level up the flask you get for it.Overall it's one of the greatest gaming experiences recently and it is worth the money you pay for it. Especially if you have a regional price.(Waiting for the fix for the technical issues)"
Positive,BRAT YOU CALL THAT A DUEL
Positive,"The game is amazing , insane visuals , well optimised , 0 crashes , really fun , it encourages exploration in beautifully detailed environments.To run it on full beans you do need the latest and greatest hardware but the game does give you a lot of settings to tweak for your convenience.Overall Highly recommend it , it is challenging but also rewarding.props to the developers for nailing this one.BRAVO !!"
Positive,"F*ck SweetBabyInc and all the useless woke journalists who tried to get this game cancelled!This game is amazing, beautiful, and incredibly fun!Those are the most important things that game companies need to focus on, not the DEI and political agendas from these entitled clowns in the media."
Positive,"One of the Best Games I have Ever Played, Recommend For All Gamers, One Of the Best Story Game,Graphic and Etc. Best Game Of 2024, 1st day Totally 6 Hours Played, and My reaction Was Epic in the Starting Of THe Game,, BEST, BEST"
Positive,Reject humanity return to monke:Jokes aside Wukong is a fantastic action rpg that plays similarly to sekiro (minus the parry system) and is chock-full of hard bosses. Also I can't believe how smooth the game runs for an Unreal Engine 5 game. The Devs did a great job when it come to the optimization ^_^.

Positive,"Wow, this game is f**king incredible! The visuals are absolutely breathtaking..The combat system is insanely engaging . The character’s movements are fluid, and the use of spells makes every battle a thrill. The variety of combat options keeps encounters exciting, and those transformation abilities are a badass twist. I’m absolutely recommending this game—it’s a must-play for action RPG fans and anyone who craves immersive combat and epic exploration!and yes, fuck IGN"
Positive,"I have been a fan of the Journey to the West ever since I read some version of it in high school, but it wasn't until I started my own inner cultivation practice that I truly appreciated the story.That this is a continuation of that Myth is really something that makes me excited to play all the way through.I finished the first chapter, I play on a ROG Zypheras (spelling?) with Kubuntu OS, NVidia Geforce RTX, and intl core i7 (11th/12th generation i think). Took a minute to get it working but I ended up using the 535 drivers and installing GEproton 9 Experimental to run it. I get between 30 and 120 fps. I run it on low, and I still have the fps issue. Recommended settings are high, and it looks great on it, but i still get the fps fr drop quite a bit, and I don't know what else to do. I spent my time in the first level, getting to the bear boss, and then before beating him going back through the level slowly. This game is more God of War than Dark Souls, which I'm thankful. I don't mind it being mostly linear boss rush, It makes sense for the Character overall too. I look forward to taking my time with this game."

Positive,"If you have difficulty understanding the plot, please read the <<The Journey to the West>>, which is my favorite book."
Positive,Best game i have played since Elden Ring and Baldurs Gate 3After 30hours and on Chp 4 i stand correct this is the best game i have played in a while and if you don't like the combat or think its to hard to grasp or dont like it etc.... suck it your F'd if you think this game is bad
Positive,Glad they finally made a game showing us the aftermath of planet of the apes things have got a little weird for the monkeys should of kept mark wahlberg around a little longer No but honestly a game where its not easy and i don't complete it in like 5 hours grips my attention deffo pick this up
Positive,"Enough reviews have covered the excellent combat, enemy variety, the absolutely stunning environments and epic boss battles. I agree wholeheartedly with all of these takes. However I would like to draw attention to a few issues which may impact your experience. - The lack of a map. In Chapter 1, you can get by okay with no map - in general it's a pretty linear level with some branches. But in Chapter 2, the level is massive - and I found myself getting turned around on more than one occasion.- Invisible Walls. They are everywhere - even in places you would expect you could traverse to. Maybe some kind of small effect could be added to indicate an impassable piece of terrain?- The Destined One can jump, but can't pull himself up on edges. Sometimes ranged enemies are perched up high and you have to awkwardly jump to them. Platforming is not one of the games' strengths."

Positive,"These days, it's become somewhat rare to find a AAA game that stays true to its promises and potential. This is one of them, delivering on everything we hoped for.So far, my biggest complains are the unchangeable, narrow FOV and some invisible walls. But honestly, that's just nitpicking. The game has been absolutely stellar otherwise. Dare I say, Black Myth: Wukong is more fun than Elden Ring."

Positive,"I watched Journey to the West during my childhood, This game brings me back. the graphics are top notch and the gameplay is smooth, I can tell the developers put their time and effort into this game. I'm glad the story of Wukong will be seen by many more people around the world. Masterpiece of a game."
Positive,"Overall Rating: 9.5/10This game is a beast! It exceeded all my expectations and delivers a phenomenal experience that’s hard to match.Graphics: Unreal Engine 5The visuals are nothing short of breathtaking. The detail, lighting, and overall presentation set a new standard for what I expect from a game’s graphics.Gameplay: SuperbThe gameplay is incredibly engaging, especially with the challenging boss fights that keep you on your toes. Audio: EargasmThe sound design is phenomenal, with music and effects that perfectly complement the game’s atmosphere. Every sound is crisp and adds to the immersion. Audience: Adults, Smash-that-button addictsWhile the game can appeal to a wide audience, its challenging nature makes it particularly suitable for adults and those who love intense action games.PC Requirements: Ask NASA if they have a spare computerBe prepared to run this game on a high-end PC. The visuals and performance demands are high, but they are worth every bit of power your system can offer.Game Size: Will eat 10% of your 1TB hard drive (119 GB)It’s a big game, so make sure you have enough space on your hard drive to accommodate it.Difficulty: Very difficultThe game is challenging, and it doesn’t hold your hand. It requires patience, strategy, and skill to progress.Grind: Average grind levelThere’s a moderate amount of grind, but it never feels overwhelming or necessary to enjoy the game.Story: LovelyThe story is captivating, and the rich mythology adds depth and intrigue to every aspect of the game.Game Time: LongIt’s a lengthy adventure that promises hours of entertainment. I’m still working my way through, and every moment has been a delight.Bugs: Never experienced or heard ofIn my experience, the game runs smoothly without any noticeable bugs, which is impressive given its complexity.Price: Just buy it!This game is absolutely worth the price. Don’t hesitate to add it to your collection."
Positive,"My PC specs is i5-12600k+3060ti and running the game with the 'High' setting. There're few things I wanna talk about:-The intro video is awesome, however my specs is not enough to provide a good quality video, it's all dot pixel around the shape of character. Actually I have the same issue while running the benchmark tool, something like a spider web floats on the river. So basically, the graphic is not that good imo, unless you have higher GPU. In exchange, the game runs super smooth while playing.-The difficulty of boss fight is harder than my expectation, you still need to manage character stamina to either attack or doge, but way more easier than the DarkSoul series. You can stop the boss or transform into monsters with high attack power to deal more damage. Also, go check the skill tree to build up a good set can reduce the difficulty as well.-The map exploration is not that bad as some media said. The game is not open-world, so it's easy to find the way back if you reach the edge of map. There're many forked roads, so be patient in exploring them, they may leads you to different bosses or some items.At all to say, the game 'Black Myth:Wukong' definitely has some flaws at the first day release, but still worth to buy and play. The intense boss fight experience and the Zen atmosphere attract me so much. I strongly recommend to play this game with using the Chinese voice audio."
Positive,"I'm sure the Western gaming press didn't give ‘Black Myth: Wukong’ the rating it deserved.It's not because I'm a Chinese gamer that I blindly praise my country for creating a work of art.From the IGN review: ‘The story assumes you have knowledge of Journey to the West and is tough to follow without it’. I think localised translations do present some problems, as many complex cultural backgrounds take a long time to research in order to make the most accurate translation.But for all the overseas players, please trust me that a lot of the game's backstory is hard to understand even for me, such as some of the words carved on the stone monuments.In addition, there is also something that game science, a game maker, likes to hide content, and many parts of the game content are scattered throughout the game, requiring players to constantly explore and dig into the details.I hope this game can become a huge success and everyong can enjoy the game content while he is exploring the mysterious world of Journey to the West.Amazing game in every aspect. Totally recommended it if you're into something similar to God of War (the new one) with some soulslike mechanics. Very fun to play, linear and semi-open world regions with lots of exploration, secrets, enemies and some remarkable bosses.As far as performance goes, if you don't use Ray Tracing on Very High (or don't use it at all) and turn on upscaling, you'll be fine. Ray Tracing is quite demanding in some areas later in the game. Even with Frame Generation, it may not be enough depending on your GPU.Also, yes, New Game+ unlocks after you finish the game. You get to keep everything you earned, except the items required to progress the story. Enemies also become stronger.Played most of the game at 1440p, 60 fps, Cinematic Settings, DLSS Balanced, FG ON, Ray Tracing Very High.I had one crash. No blue screen or out of memory errors."
Positive,"THIS IS LITERALLY GOTY CONTENDER FOR ME AND I LITERALLY JUST JUMPED INTO THE GAME OMG THIS GAME IS SOOO BEAUTIFUL!!! The graphics and art style are top shelf, gourmet, tier one."
Positive,"10/10 Masterpiece.Denuvo is shit, performance is meh. Graphics and art design are stunning. Best visuals."
Positive,Authentic Chinese mythology setting. Really interesting.Challenging combat with a lot of abilities.Performance is good with the right settings but can stutter a bit.Really enjoyed it so far.
Positive,After beating the game I can say this! It is GAME OF THE YEAR No doubt! never have I EVER been so disrespected in the final boss fight of ANY VIDEO GAME
Positive,Graphics and Gameplay is immersive and Very Optimized(RTX 4080)...I
Positive,"While Black Myth: Wukong delivers on its promise of adrenaline-pumping action and immersive combat, it falls painfully short in terms of inclusivity and diversity. The complete lack of RGB representation is unacceptable and disappointing, especially in an era where gaming should be a space for all humanoid creatures. Moreover, the absence of playable female characters reinforces outdated gender norms, sidelining female monkeys in a genre where they are already underrepresented. The game also leans heavily into toxic masculinity, glorifying hyper aggressive male archetypes.9/10"
Positive,"So far I have done 5 bosses and what i like about it the most is how perfect the difficulty feels. not super punishing like from soft games but also not too easy. just feels right. also the combat, cut scenes, flow of the game, music, sound design, character progression and the level of immersion are just top notch. i cant wait to keep playing this!"
Positive,"Don't buy this expecting dark souls.. I think its much more similar to a nioh with dark souls rolling patterns in there. Very fun combat, flashy and cool. Some animations take forever to do but if you play right youll never worry about it :)editing this: 31 hours in now.Wow10/10Just wow.Still got a bit to go and this game plays so well.. how are more people not buying this?This needs 100million copies sold.This is as good as a fromsoft game in terms of quality in ARPG fluidity and gameplay.It feels and plays great.. the animations are awesome.My ONLY gripe is hitboxes are a bit wierd on enemies but just get good ;)Great game!!! take your time!

Positive,2024 Game of The Year
Positive,"A great game which shows new concepts and whole new adventures that other games never had given.1. Bosses are easy to deal except several ones but the amount of bosses is over 80 which won't let you bored.2. So many elements about chinese culture like you are touring in China.3. CGs are epic like in cinema.4. Maps of each chapter is wide,but you may be confused when meeting an air wall to block you to dig more.5. Fighting is whole new,you will feel that when you play."
Positive,"Pretty awesome game so far. I'm not really one to hunt for secrets or 100% these games, so I appreciate the linear path it gives you for the most part. Definitely not souls-like even though people keep trying to say it is. Maybe one boss so far has got me into double digits before killing it, stupid Tiger Vanguard, otherwise it may be a few tries before it's done. You don't lose anything and most the respawns are only a few seconds away to just run right back and try again. The GoW and Star Wars games are a better reference to how it plays. I absolutely hate the Souls series and Elden Ring is such a dumpster fire of dogshit. If it was remotely close to either I wouldn't be playing Wukong."
Positive,"God Damn THIS GAME!!! DESERVE AN AWARD the game looks unfinished game on chapter 1 no maps , no guides, just randomly walking around and met like 9 bosses (5 kings 4 chiefs) I thought the game gonna be like boss rush... till the end... guess im wrong... the game start  becomes a hell of fun since chapter 2!... OMG exploring a quite huge area without maps! LOL!! my brain keeps working on re-mapping and everything then I realize... there are so many bosses in this game... Like who else gonna make this many bosses and still got so long story... this must be crazy... almost any other games I can tell that the bosses are countable... this one? LOL! too much.. even if their mechanics does not differs a lot but I like a straightforward games that not wasting time on side stories like many other games did... 40+ hours just filled with fillers and useless annoying side stories... while this one is pretty straightforward just like FINAL FANTASY XVI ... PRETTY AWESOME FOR CHINESE TRIPLE A GAME!!!  SBI IGN SCREENRANT CAN GTFO!!"
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong ReviewI played 9 hours but 4 were offline so I think it will say I played 5 hours, I didn't beat the game, yet I still made this comprehensive review to explain the core aspects of the game and it's quality. This review uses my own experience and those of my friends who got ahead in the game. I am 30 years old, and I don't enjoy souls likes anymore in the long term. Still, I did my review objectively and I think you might find it useful. Cheers!~Black Myth Wukong is a soul-like game that adds some interesting elements to the genre by incorporating new ideas into its gameplay through the legendary tale of Sun Wukong. Players can transform into bosses they defeated before (with some limitations), and Wukong's tricks are plenty. They can range from transforming into rock to making multiple clones of themselves or freezing foes in place, unable to move or fight back.The player will explore the tale of the legendary monkey king while fighting challenging bosses and recovering the artifacts of Wukong. The game starts easy but rapidly reaches difficulty levels of your most popular soul games, requiring skill, strategy, and wits to defeat fearsome foes.What Makes It Worth Playing?If there is something people hear about this game, it is two things: transforming into bosses and ray tracing. The ray tracing of the game looks beautiful, as reflections and environments look superb on the screen. The requirements are quite bulky, as I used an RTX 4070 Super and could either go 2k with Ray Tracing at medium with settings on very high for 70-90 FPS or 4k with no ray tracing at the same frame rate.The story is surprisingly very good and interesting, voice actors do well in their assigned roles, and the opening of the game is similar to a blockbuster movie. The tale deals with wanting to be free, which Wukong wants, but the Celestial Court won't let him be. In addition, the court enjoys mocking him and other beast-like creatures, angering him as he rebels to prove his might. The difficulty is another aspect that might attract players looking to establish themselves and face off against challenging foes in exciting and nerve-wracking gameplay.Core GameplayThe game's core combat focuses on options and the availability of resources. The player has multiple avenues for choosing how to fight enemies, such as spirits that they can summon and take their form to unleash special attacks, becoming bosses, using skills such as invisibility, or using their pole to get above the enemy and avoid attacks. Having so many assets to use on foes and see what works best against certain enemies is incredibly fun and rewarding.The premise is that the game is a boss rush; you go to a place, explore it, beat the boss, and move on. If you defeat bosses effortlessly, you run into a lot of bosses on the norm, and each combat is intriguing and unique. Battle monks that summon the fallen, rat siblings in a 1vs2, giant tigers that bathe in the blood of their foes with big swords, etc. The game action is fast, so you have to act quickly before enemies resume the onslaught of attacks. There is no co-op for this game (so those that like souls games with co-op experiences, be warned, it is only going to be you!), and there is no punishment for dying in-game, so you are stress-free and don't have to pick up your ""souls"" or currencies of other types.My ExperienceI enjoyed my time in the game, as brief as it was (I am getting old to be playing this hardcore game, I swear, haha~). I didn't find the stances attractive, as the default stance worked better for me than the other two. The tricks of Wukong are fun to use, and in boss fights, you need to use all of your arsenals intelligently to emerge victorious on the challenging boss fights, which is a great gameplay design. Enemies often have their particular bag of tricks they will use on the player.I used many points in the foundation, mainly HP and stamina. I also used some points in transformations and the immobility spell, as they are instrumental. The gameplay is like a combination of souls, like in action games. It is hard, but you are as powerful as your foes, making the soul-like experience less stressful and difficult. The game's presentation is fantastic; enemies react to your boss's transformations, and the dialogue in fights is on par with the rest of the game.Long Term AppealA game playthrough will last between 40-60 hours, depending on your skill, and you can always replay the game after beating it to challenge even stronger foes. I am getting burned out of the genre. Go there, fight a powerful enemy, get destroyed, do it again until you succeed, and repeat for another 40 hours. I may have been playing too much Elden Ring, but I don't enjoy Souls games as much as I did before.Back to the review, if you like challenges meant to block your progression and prove your skills, this game is impressive. It excels at all its facets and is incredible to experience. If you prefer to avoid difficulty, be wary. It is a marathon to get to the end of this title, as the mountain is rather tall and complex to climb.Price Point AnalysisIt is an easy buy for its asking price. If your computer can run it, you are guaranteed to have a good time with this game.ConclusionIn a genre so cluttered with so many games that it feels oversaturated, Black Myth Wukong succeeds in adding a new spice to the genre by revolutionizing the gameplay and rewards of its core experience. It is a must-play for all souls, like fans who enjoy this title, and an invitation to try it out for those who feel braver and confident in their skills. This game's graphics, music, story, gameplay, and design are superb and worth all the praise it's been getting.10/10 MASTERPIECE:) If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator!

Positive,Great game. I am enjoying Magic Son Goku.
Positive,"Good combat, beautiful graphics and impressive skill system. You need nothing more. 10/10 would buy it."
Positive,Love the game. The only letdown for me is a lack of support for HDR and 16:10 aspect ratios.
Positive,"The ""shameless lack of diversity"" made me post a positive review for the first time.I like mythology and love the story and lore this game offers. I am not usually a fan of Souls-like games, but this one does not lean too heavily on the genre. The boss combat can be challenging, with a few losses here and there until you get used to the bosses' movements. The game does not have a map and exploration is a must.Overall, I like the game and the difficulty. I'd recommend to others to try it out!Edit: For those who want to earn achievements should look up the steam guide. There are some things you need to do first prior to a boss fight or finishing a whole chapter."

Positive,"Original review (17ish hours):Awesome game. Combat feels awesome. Difficult boss rush game that keeps you coming back. Only complaint is that I wish I could traverse more of the terrain because there are a lot of seemingly places you can get to, but invisible walls will lock you to main paths.Edit after completing the game (70+ hours):Holy crap. This was awesome. This game will live rent free in my head for years. Where is the super thumbs up button? Chapter 3 is super long, but aside from that, loved the game and the hunting for secrets"

I will continue to play and maybe edit this review later on, but is it worth a buy? yes 100% loving it so far"
Positive,"A monkey reaps what he sows... That's one of life's immortal truths that are so true that I almost find them funny.If I had learned anything from this game, it is that you should never say no to a story. This is an eye-opener game. This is grand and this is epic. Such greatness and excellence. Characters, music, the world, and its stories.Journey to the West is the kind of tale that moves the mountains and buries the sun.Never did I experience such an ambitious, incredible, and jaw-dropping adventure. It's so touching that I cannot help but feel like a piece of me is missing now that I finished the game.The stakes are heaven and earth themselves but also are nothing more than you, than me, an individual, and their inner spirit. They are global and far-reaching, yet so private.On a chessboard where the the pieces are the players, and the players are ever perplexed whether they are destiny's pawns or each is the result of their own doing. Are we mere instruments for the Celestial court, for those high above? or are we truly a monkey reaps what he sows?This journey is so magnificent and well-written that it makes you wish to be Chinese. That you were there in the 1600s. That you were with the journeyers, for I wished that... and since wishes aren't horses, to that end, I bid all of you farewell at this moment, for our journey is unfinished and we shall all meet in the novel."

Positive,"I want to give this 10/10 rating but can't because not only am i a hater, i also suck at this game. there's been a few fights that made me eat my own shit from the hitboxes and locked on attacks simply not connecting for some reason. oh and the instant transmission attacks some enemies do. game looks and feels great minus a few rep points for the button scheme on controller. After a few polishing patches i'll change this review from a solid 8/10P.S. This is NOT a souls-like ppl this is an absolute action RPG"
Positive,"Going blind here with only Dragon Ball Z and Saiyuki: Journey West knowledge and I think I'm doing great \m/The game mixes God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, Jedi Fallen Order, Castlevania and slight FromSoft mechanics and it's good. Don't really need to wait for a sale on this one if you like those games.Also, don't read too much reviews from 'game' journalist."
Positive,Game is genuinely a great game. Rarely any bugs. Very good graphics. Game play is addicting. From a studio that does majority mobile games this is actually insane work they deserve all the praise. Triple A studios take notes from these games doing better than you with way less resources and ask why? Start to care about what you are providing rather than the cash grab. Great job Game Science on this masterpiece.

Positive,"Nearly 40 hours in, chapter 4 reached.and so far I've done so by only playing on my steamdeck....limited to 45FPS (with dips to 30 in very large areas,... so far  not with bosses or tough parts) This game feels as responsive as a game like this SHOULD feel. despite needing to upscale the game quite a bit it still looks gorgeous! all round, it's rare for a game these days to be ready on launchday... And I'm glad to see such an anticipated game did not disappoint so many people waiting for it.Well done developers!"
Positive,"Well, here we go.The Batles are fluid, the game optimization are good. The story are good. What else? Stop read this review and play right now. 10/10 for me. Already complete the achievement too. Waiting for DLC (if any). Worth for every pennies you spend in this game even at full price.Shame on you Sweet Baby Inc. Stop force the gamers with your agenda!

Positive,"One of the Best games I've ever played!!Just finished the game with True Ending and there's so many things to praise about it, Positives :-  Visuals: Breathtaking, Next-Gen, Stunning, Glorious, you name it. Probably the best visuals I've seen amongst all the game I've played so far. Its attention to detail, little things like the swinging bamboo door curtains, or the hundreds of tiny terracotta statues that manage to look different from one another, giving it an eerie beauty. The villages look similar to how my grandma's place used to look when I was a little kid, they nailed it. The environments they create really make you feel like you're there in the game, its hard to describe; Chapters 3 and 4 were especially beautiful. Couldn't ask for it to be better. -  Characters & Cinematics: Likeable and diverse (believe it or not) while sticking to its theme of Wukong's lore. With cool ass one-liners from bosses to fight scenes that make you ""Absolute Cinema"". You grow to like the characters, some of them through the CGs whereas others while fighting them.-   Bosses & Combat: They found the right balance between difficulty and fun. With really Unique boss and combat designs. Unlike some other games, Bosses don't just come up and try to kill you for no reason. Some bosses fight you as they train you up, whereas others choose a less verbal form of communication.  Erlang you were one tough son of a b*tch  Negatives :-  Optimization: Could be a bit better optimized. Although it ran well 97% of the time, some areas gave frame drops and sometimes using the Spirit froze the screen for a second. -  Lack of Guidance & Direction: If not a mini-map, even a map with ""M"" could've been helpful for some areas, especially in Chapter 6. Overall Rating : 9/10"

Positive,"At first I was skeptical about this game due to the large storage (130 GBs yikes) and hefty price tag. But once I played, all my doubts are cleansed. Good combat, no big open world, and most importantly, NOT a Soulslike (thank god, that formula is stale af)Besides, this purchase is a big middle finger to IGN, you folks think you can do another Alien: Isolation review and get away scotch free? I don't think so!"
Positive,Pros:Good storyGraphics and audioUIAnimationsCons:Invisible wallsLack of mapCombat gets repetitive later on and lacks variety.Boss balance could be better.Solid 7.5/10More like god of war then souls game.
Positive,"I’m really enjoying Black Myth: Wukong! The game is incredibly fun, with combat that feels impactful and satisfying. The storyline is also very engaging, and if you’re not familiar with Journey to the West, I strongly recommend reading it to get a better grasp of the game’s rich narrative. The graphics, scenes, and character designs are stunning, adding so much to the overall experience.For those who might be hesitant due to the game’s difficulty, don’t worry—it’s challenging but not as punishing as Souls-like games. Even as a casual gamer, I made it to Chapter 3 and found the boss battles to be rewarding rather than frustrating. If you’re struggling with a boss, there are plenty of online guides and player strategies that can help you out.I encourage everyone to give Black Myth: Wukong a chance. Despite the learning curve, you’ll find plenty of fun and accomplishment in overcoming its challenges. Definitely worth a playthrough :)"
Positive,"A breath of fresh air and a surprisingly good game from developers I have never heard of.The fans of action RPGs out there will be delighted to know that this is one of the best games I have played for 2024. Unlike most, I will say that Black Myth has many similarities to games like Devil May Cry and Ninja Gaiden. The only thing similar to God of War - since many compare it to - is the story. Also I do not consider it a soulslike - it shares a couple of mechanics, sure, but it is more fast-paced and the element of hack n' slash is very strong here. Very interesting story, especially for those who are accustomed to the Chinese folklore / mythology.All in all, from me it is a must buy. Having a blast so far and from the looks of it, I have much more to explore."
Positive,"Excellent game, lovely visuals and smooth fighting animations. Story has been good and engaging so far, not an easy combat though, there are some really tough bosses."
Positive,Monke See Monke Do
Positive,Monk stronk. Monk fun. Make monk happy and play.
Positive,"A good action game, but lack polishing in terms of its combat system.the good:+ a decent looking game+ tons of unique bosses that need players to learn and adapt+ fluent animation for not just combat, but also different creatures in the worldthe bad:- not rewarding enough for high-level combos. You can enjoy those boss fights, sure, but it's because you overcome the difficulty through trail and error, definitely not because you can do cool stuff and feel like a b@d@ss. Sometimes it can feel punishing to try those cool combos even if you can pull them off at the right moment.- a ""lost-in-the-wild"" simulator. The game world looks stunning , but there are few effective visual cues or landmarks in the world to help players navigate. Not to mention there is currently no map in the game, making path-finding a nightmare from time to time.the mix:1. Interesting narrative style, if you know some about Journey to the West, know some about Chinese culture, and can grasp the basic meaning of Classic Chinese.2. However, if you are one of the above, be aware that a large part of the story is based on conspiracy theories.3. The game features many old school adventure designs, like hidden pathways, breakable walls, back tracking, and treasure hunting. But be warned, this is also a game without map. Occasionally, you may feel like they design the game this way just to stall your progress.Overall, I would recommend this game to action fans and those who don't mind failures.You can see this game as an adventure puzzle game, where every boss is a puzzle to solve. You seek tools, you try, you die, you reset your skills for free, and you adapt.I don't recommend the game solely for its story. Language and culture aside, there is no difficulty options, let alone a story mode, so you really have to put time and effort into the game to progress the story."
Positive,Excellent Game -> God of War Vibes
Positive,"This is an edit of the review after I beat the gameThis game is brimming with personality and love for the chinese mythology. Every chapter ends with an animation, or music video, whether it is drawn or made in stop motion, as well as a huge hand drawn painting that you can interact with, which tell you a story about what you're looking at on said painting in a sort of riddle. (also PLEASE MAKE AN ANIMATED SERIES WITH THE CUTSCENE FROM CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSION)The gameplay is VERY satisfying, hits FEEL powerful and the sound design is spectacular for said hits. After beating the TRUE ENDING AND SECRET FINAL BOSS, my point review still stands. If I were to rate the game without balance in mind, this game is EASILY a 9 or 10/10. But If I rate it with how some enemies are balanced, it gets an 8.5/10. Some enemies are very poorly balanced, and actively make some encounters very annoying to fight, though it gets better as you get more tools. the final true ending boss was such an amazing experience and i'm so happy that these developers put so much love into the game. felt so refreshing playing such a well crafted game"

Positive,"the nature of monkey was irrepressible.as a kid growing up in the 80's ""monkey magic"" was one of my favorite tv shows, me and my friends would run around with sweeping brushes fighting each other, in those days, we were all monkey.and now 40+ years later i can finally play as the monkey king again...the visuals are stunning, the audio and voice acting is excellent, the combat is fast flowing and the creature design based on chinese mythology is a joy to behold.the game runs very well for me  rx 7800 xt no crashes or stuttering so far but there is some weird artefacting during game play and in the cut scenes. its annoying but not game breaking.as a first? game on pc from game science it is truly impressive."
Positive,"My favorite folklore from China. there are lots of movies about it. I remember watching the series when I was a kid. so good.. also, the game itself is really good. for a first time major release from Chinese developer, I would say, congrats! this game is just amazing."
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong is everything i wanted. I always loved the Character and seeing him get his own Game is truly a blessing.Gameplay is nice and smooth!EDIT 100%:Truly been one of the best Games of all time for me!It was a fun journey, can't wait for more!"
Positive,"A strong contender for the 2024 Game of the year, the malicious slurs still can't hide the brilliance behind it. The unique Chinese mythology narrative, ingenious and innovative game fighting system, and peak art design make this game the uncrowned king of action role-playing games this year. The game has been unfairly maligned since its inception, but it's clear that the game is proving to be great. As the first game of Game Science, this game shows its unmatched strength. In terms of the action system, no game can be better than this game. In terms of narrative, it also makes me want to know more about Chinese mythological stories, especially Journey to the West. If you are a fan of action games, I highly recommend you try this game."
Positive,Just Buy it already! this game is worth every Rupee
Positive,got me wet。
Positive,"Amazing combat, very fast-paced and satisfying"
Positive,gotyupdate after 11h - 11/10
Positive,"This is such a stunning game to play, not to mention that the graphics is made by Unreal Engine 5, and the combat is so fluent with that crazy graphics. Also, difficulty is okay, I’m new to dark soul kinda games, but I still had a lot of fun with this game."
Positive,"In today’s gaming industry, it’s common to see a discrepancy between pre-release gameplay footage and the final product. However, ""Black Wukong Myth"" is a remarkable exception. This game not only meets but exceeds expectations in terms of graphics and gameplay, showcasing the developers' dedication and meticulous craftsmanship.Initially, I had modest expectations for ""Black Wukong Myth,"" but once I started playing, it quickly became clear that this game is a class act. The developers have clearly invested significant time and effort into polishing every aspect of the game.The first thing that struck me was the game’s breathtaking visual effects. Utilizing the Unreal Engine 5, ""Black Wukong Myth"" is truly a graphics powerhouse. The detailed lighting, realistic shadows, and dynamic scene interactions make it a visual spectacle. It’s evident that a lot of thought went into creating a visually immersive experience that pushes the limits of current hardware.What sets ""Black Wukong Myth"" apart is its deep connection to traditional Chinese culture. The game’s text, imagery, and environmental design are rich with cultural elements. From the intricate skill animations to the carefully crafted items and scenery, every detail reflects a reverence for Chinese heritage. This cultural authenticity not only enhances the game’s narrative but also immerses players in a beautifully rendered world steeped in tradition.This game stands out as a shining example of high-quality game design. It surpasses the usual post-release letdowns with its exceptional graphics and thoughtful integration of cultural elements. For anyone seeking a game that delivers on its promises and offers a visually stunning and culturally enriching experience, this title is a must-play."
Positive,When 'Made in China' is not an insult anymore. Pure masterpiece!
Positive,Destined One to Game Industry
Positive,"7/10 .. maybe wait for sale to buy.Pros:Very Good graphics, smooth AF game play, engaging bossesConsBoss rush simulator, very low world exploration, few visual and camera bugs, very linear"
Positive,Completing this game feels like getting out of prison
Positive,my only complaint is lack of mimic on our protagonist whilst literally everyone else is so expressivestill great game though
Positive,"It's been a long time since I started waiting for you to come out.You made me dream with every trailer you released.And you delivered on the promised date.On a serious note, I can't speak for people with mid-range PCs, but on a high-end system, it's an unparalleled experience, worth every effort to see."
Positive,"Suck it, kotaku.8/10Honestly I wouldn’t say it is a masterpiece but most of the gameplay is pretty badass. Besides some performance issues the game is quite fun for me.Is it souls-like? Not really, it is more like Monster Hunter or Sekiro, or all of the souls-like game combined and tuned down a level; in simple terms, it’s an RPG, a really hard RPG game.I understand that some of you guys have some bias on Chinese studios, or you really believe those “diversity”  propaganda bullcrap. I only want to try the game myself, it’s okay to have your thoughts, so I’ll also have my own.Now let’s be a jerk. Since I’ve played a couple of souls-like games myself, I can clearly see what the devs were going. I have a strong vibe of early souls-like like Dark Souls 2, and some elements of Monster Hunter and Hollow Knight. The game has some unique combat implemented but it mainly feels like a lot of things were “sutured together” and I really don’t know how to transcribe it since it gave me a mixed experience while combatting. But if you’re a new player experiencing this type of games, then it is for you, cause it’s easy as hell compared to other souls-likes.Now, performance issues. I’ve heard a lot of things about stuttering & black screens. I didn’t experience it myself, but most of the time my frame rate was around 60~90 so I wouldn’t say it is terrible. But sometimes when there’re a lot of particles, it will drop to around 20~30, which is really bad since half of the bosses have particles around them. You can tune the graphics down a little bit to “neutralize” the issue but I know you all want that big juicy scenery all the time without loosing your frame rate, right? So yeah, I hope they’ll fix it asap.Generally I don’t want to write something so long I don’t even want to read, but I think it’s necessary to tell everyone my honest opinion of this game, and my stand that I don’t give a F about the ones who don’t play games, cause I play games. So take that, IGN.One thing I forgot to mention is the utterly stupid fking translation, especially English (since I launched the game with that crap) and I just couldn’t continue playing until I swapped it back to Simplified Chinese. I kinda understand why the translation is so bad cause most of the content is just Chinese mythology and fictions, but I really do think they’re not even trying. Do better, okay? This is the only crap that pissed me off. Don’t ask, I’m Chinese. I do know the difference between the two.下边这段话是给中国玩家说的，发自内心的一句劝。先把游戏玩了，别在这儿发什么没用的B玩应儿，有好的就夸，觉得不好的你就批评，好玩就好玩，不好玩就不好玩，别搁这里跟我讲情怀，咱花了钱是为了体验游戏的，不是来看别人脸色的。（除非是别人给我买的）"

P.S If and when there's a Wukong 2 can we maybe have an option to make our own character or even something like simple changes eye colour, shape, ear shape, maybe have no tail or a big fluffy one where we can change the colour of the fur."
Positive,3 hours played so far id give it a 8/10 because some of the bosses go into their moves extremely quick to the point where u get knocked down and when getting up u get hit again thinks i like was again the bosses are really cool and there are amazing boss arenas and visuals another thing is the abilitys are cool where u can become some bosses u defeat also monkey go round.
Positive,"A novel experience different to Dark Souls or Sekiro.  Powered by Unreal Engine 5, Black Myth: Wukong delivers some of the most photorealistic landscapes and character designs seen in modern gaming. From dense bamboo forests to towering mountains, every environment is dripping with detail. The lighting, particle effects, and smooth animations further enhance the immersion. Enemies look intimidating, and Wukong's animations, especially when transforming into different creatures, are fluid and impactful.Combat is challenging but satisfying, with a perfect balance of learning enemy patterns and responding with the right transformations and abilities. Boss battles, in particular, are standout moments, often feeling like intense tests of skill and ingenuity. The diversity of enemies keeps encounters fresh, with each foe presenting new patterns and tactics to overcome.Black Myth: Wukong is a monumental achievement in action RPGs, not only because of its stunning visuals and technical prowess but also because it delivers deeply satisfying combat wrapped in a world steeped in rich mythology. Its blend of challenging combat, mystical storytelling, and transformative gameplay mechanics make it a unique entry in the genre."
Positive,China game! This is for you!
Positive,RETURN TO MONKE
Positive,Lacks in diversity? The main character is literally a monkey...
Positive,Well worth it
Positive,Winton but chinese
Positive,"This isn't just a game, it's a huge achievement for the Chinese gaming industry! I just took down the first boss, and I can tell this game is gonna be a banger!Wukong’s story has been retold so many times in anime and TV shows, but this is the first time it's been turned into a massive AAA game. I didn’t realize how much I missed this until now. The whole thing is dripping with nostalgia. Wukong has always been my childhood hero, way more than the classic shonen characters like Naruto or Goku.This game brings back all those memories, and I’m totally hooked. I’ve only just started playing, but I’m already looking forward to what’s next! Hail to the Monkey King!Update: I have no words to describe this masterpiece, it is undoubtedly the GOTY"
Positive,98 hours and counting91/91 bosses81/81 achievementsNG+2 and countingJUST AMAZINGGOTY MATERIAL
Positive,"Now this is what we call a GENUINE AAAA product.This brings me back to the good old days of gaming where QUALITY content matters.We are so lucky that these developers exist and they have fought so hard against this woke culture garbage. Not only they have protected their ideas from western gaming journalist mindset, they have also PROVEN themselves and show the western developers WHAT IS THE REAL AAAA GAME IS ABOUT.Combat 9/10Story 8/10Fun 9/10No-inclusive material/mental illness 10/10Hopefully there is a sequel so i can keep throwing money at Game Science. Well Done everyone!"
Positive,"Finally, after around 75 hours I completed 100% achievements and can now make my review.Black Myth: Wukong to me is a phenomenal game making me reminisce about why games are so amazing. Most importantly, the game takes you on an adventure, a journey, showing you awe-inspiringly detailed environments, creative enemies and incredibly badass bosses and encounters. Plenty of moments make me think back to one of my favourite games: Asura’s Wrath, which in a similar manner strikes awe into you with how cool the things are that are happening on your screen.The production quality of this game is through the roof. The animations in this game are some of the best I can remember, from how enemies and bosses move, to dynamically chaining together different moves and creating a fast-paced flow of combat with the enemy. The environments are incredibly detailed and authentic.Game Science went above and beyond going extra mile after extra mile to achieve this.Aside from regular motion capture, for some enemies and bosses (Tiger Vanguard for example), they even went so far as to motion capture literal cats with a custom software they had to develop alongside this process. This is why some of the animations, like the Tiger Vanguard drinking from the pool of blood you find him in seem so authentic. Not only that, but they supposedly travelled across China to different cultural sites to analyse and scan temples and other places so they can accurately recreate these structures in the game. If you look at comparisons between the game and the locations they are based on, you will notice the love for detail and amount of effort that went into this.Now, the narrative of the game can be a bit confusing, if you are not at all familiar with the Journey to the West. Yet despite not necessarily knowing what is happening exactly on screen, the game does a phenomenal job at providing a very cinematic and fun experience. Black Myth: Wukong is actually not a retelling of Journey to the West, but rather takes place some time AFTER the events of the novel, in a “what happened after?” scenario thought up by the devs. Several characters you encounter during the game are from the original story.It gives you a basic foundational quest of “go on this journey to collect these 6 relics” and takes you on this incredible adventure showing you amazing and unexpected things one after the other.On this adventure, you can encounter a wild variety of enemies, without seeming repetitive whatsoever. Even the bosses are not repeated except for 2 instances, despite there being a whopping over 90 bosses. Yes, you read that right. There are over 90 bosses in this game. With only 2 minor instances of having a base model be reused. A lot of these bigger bosses are incredibly cinematic, having moves, mechanics and moments in cutscenes that make you feel like you are in the middle of an epic movie.The enemy designs in this game are very creative and varied, providing a breath of fresh air from all the typical and stereotypical types of enemies you can find in a lot of games. Bipedal snake-necked tiger monk? Check. Giant skeletal chicken mash with a Cubone summoning blood blades? Check. There are things happening in this game so wild, I am not even sure how to accurately describe them.The combat in this game feels very fluid and deliberate. To me, it just “clicked”. You have to be very deliberate with what you are doing, because depending on the actions you take, you will lock yourself to that action without being able to dodge out of it, meaning you have to decide when to commit to what by observing what is happening around you.There are a lot of progression systems in this game, from skill points, to equipment, to spirit skills (like yokai abilities in Nioh 2), set bonuses, vessels, curios (like rings), celestial medicines (max stat increases) to the gourd (I will mention this one later).With all these systems, it would be nice to be able to respec right? Want to redistribute your skill points to change your build? Different staff stance? Different spell setup? No biggie, just head to a shrine and move them around for free. This game gives you a lot of agency to play the way you want to play without locking you into one chosen path.Your gourd is basically your heal (Like an estus flask). But not only are there different gourds with slightly different effects, but you can also change the actual drink and so called “soaks” that are infused into the drink. All of this allows for an incredible amount of customization where you can adjust your gourd to fit your specific build.This game is not designed to follow trends or be a safe product to profit from. This game is designed to be fun. There are quite a few moments that make you go “Wait, I’ve never seen anything like this before”. From all these things mentioned, to minor QoL features like having the UI actually change a bit depending on whether you use a keyboard and mouse or a controller, you can feel the passion and care put into this game. The devs wanted this to be good and fun. And oh boy, fun my journey with this game was.Let us go over to a simple Pros and Cons list.Pros:Highly detailed and authentic environments.Creative and varied enemy designs featuring all kinds of animal-esque monsters.Incredible and dynamic animations.Amazing boss designs that make you go wow.No reused bosses outside of 2 instances (and even then, it is not that bad).Very fluid and deliberate gameplay (If you don’t just button mash that is).Lots of progression systems giving you a lot of agency to fine-tune your builds.Free respecs.Fascinating glimpse into Chinese mythology.Amazing music throughout the whole journey.Good game length. Took me around 35h to fully complete my first playthrough with most bosses killed (except 2 minor side bosses iirc), 75h for 100% achievements. Will definitely play the game more in the future just for fun.Makes you become monke during intense fights, having you let out monkey-like noises.Cons:Invisible walls (Could have hidden a lot of these with natural barriers like impassable rocks etc).Clunky pickups/interactions (You can interact with things that are right in front of your character, so if you are sprinting and going too fast, you might need to turn around to interact. A small 360 degree radius would have been better).There are items with random drop chances from enemies or plants that are needed to get 100% achievements. I spent over 10 hours farming 2 specific plants before finally getting my final achievement. This was incredibly frustrating. I’d hope for “skewered rng” in the future, slowly increasing the drop chance the more times it does not drop. This way, they could control the maximum amount of kills/pickups needed to get the items.Technical issues that will probably be ironed out (I played on high preset at 80% upscaling with frame gen and usually had 100+ fps in most cases throughout the whole game):Thumbnails of items not properly loading in menus.Sudden but short stutters presumably when loading in something big.Sometimes had issues with shadows/clouds seeming…pixelated for some reason.Framedrops when using bound items/spells when it opens the “radial”-esque menus for them.All in all, a lot of the issues I have with this game are things that can improve with experience for future projects. This is the first major self-developed title this studio made, so they have plenty of chances to improve on these things in the future.It is a feature complete game. No paid content. No corporate influence or agendas noticeably influencing the games narrative or game systems. The devs had a vision and they focussed on that vision with full creative freedom, wanting to share what they love and have players enjoy it.This game reminded me why I love video games.I 100% recommend this game."

Positive,Definitely the best game that came out this year! This is a must have in your list to play.
Positive,Awesome game. Runs great. Such a cool story so far.
Positive,"This game is incredible and truly amazing. The in game design and Chinese culture just flourishes and the music redefines it even more. I know some people are experiencing some issues with the game, but I haven’t encountered anything game breaking or anything that would make me not recommend this game. I 100% recommend this game. It’s a 10/10 for me"
Positive,"In the worlds before Monkey, primal chaos reigned. Heaven sought order. But the phoenix can fly only when its feathers are grown. The four worlds formed again and yet again, As endless aeons wheeled and passed. Time and the pure essences of Heaven, the moisture of the Earth, the powers of the sun and the moon, all worked upon a certain rock, old as creation. And it became magically fertile. That first egg was named ""Thought"". Tathagata Buddha, the Father Buddha, said, ""With our thoughts, we make the world."" Elemental forces caused the egg to hatch. From it then came a stone monkey. The nature of Monkey was irrepressible!"
Positive,"This is definitely a fun game to play, stunning view everywhere in the game, tons of legendary monsters/gods from famous eastern novel (first ever seen in 3A games), challenging bosses, smooth action playing, interesting skill/growth system, etc. All these are combined in the game well and with thoughtful design. I can see the producers/devs put massive efforts on this game, and give birth to such a masterpiece of eastern fantasy world. There is one that could be improved for sure, better in-game guidance (mini-map or directional tool at least to tell me north/south), and no other complaints. I have played for around 10 hours, and just finished first chapter. No crash, no lagging, no issues from game itself. Kudos to Game Science team! Great game and good job!"

Positive,"Um jogo que não coloquei nenhuma expectativa devido a tanto lançamento genérico hoje em dia, mas me surpreendeu demais, a mitologia chinesa é incrível e muito bem utilizada nesse game, vale a pena cada segundo, gráficos lindos e boss fights intensas e muito divertidas. É com certeza o GOTY 2024 :D"
Positive,"Yeah, it's recommended. It's not perfect, it has atrocious droprates for some stuff and there are hidden mechanics (or things the game forgets to tell about), which you may accidentally discover late game or never. Other than that not much to complain about. The presentation is 100/100 and the gameplay is incredibly polished."
Positive,"This game was simply amazing.  I wasn't going to check it out initially until I heard all the buzz about it and saw how well it was doing on Steam, and my god, am I glad I checked it out.  Black Myth: Wukong hit practically everything out of the park for me.  The visuals are stunning and amazing, the world feels alive and vibrant, bosses are difficult and carefully crafted, the story was intriguing and interesting, and the game was challenging and rewarding.  Never have I even thought about looking at and reading enemy and boss bios and stories until this game.  That is how thoroughly it got me interested.  If I can do anything with this review I would like to convince the reader of this review to buy, download, and play this game.  It's a masterpiece and a truly amazing experience.  This is my vote for GOTY 2024 for sure.  Amazing job devs, thank you so much for the wonderful game! :)"

Positive,"9.5/10Story can get a bit confusing if you are not familiar with the story of ""The Journey to the West"".Combat is top-notch. Feels very fluid and it feels great to counter/parry/perfect dodge enemies' attack.Level design is the only aspect that I think can be improved. There are invisible walls everywhere and without a minimap, it gets quite confusing sometimes.My personal GOTY of 2024."
Positive,"Wukong is a beautiful game made by devs that clearly put a lot of love and effort into their project. Insane attention to detail in the environments, with dev team actually going to various temples throughout China, beautiful animations at the end of each chapter that tell a specific story from ""Journey to the West"", great soundtrack, very varied locations and enemies, game only really starts repeating some enemies and animations towards the very end, and even then it's extremely rare, probably less than 3 enemies through the entire game. A lot of bosses have unique gimmicks and aren't just trying to spam long-winded combos that last for ten seconds or more, and with very few exceptions you usually have tools to ensure you are never stuck on the defensive for too long.I do have issues with the game. Main character often misses his attacks on some of the bigger enemies and bosses, camera can be very slow during boss fights, chapter 2 imo was so dull it almost made me drop the game, some bosses can feel a bit overtuned or just bad, there's an insane amount of invisible walls in the beginning, and yet in later areas some secrets require you to drop down from ledges, resulting in you constantly hitting every boundary with poor monkey's head. But despite everything, I can wholeheartedly recommend this project just because of the amount of passion that developers put into it, and that's not even taking into account that the game overall is better than a lot of the AAA slop we've been getting for years, including some other representatives of the genre. It's not a perfect game by any means, but it's one made by people that actually care about their craft, and aren't just in it to make a quick buck."

Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong genuinely exceeded my expectations. The polish and attention to detail are remarkable, and I’ve had an absolute blast with it so far. The graphics and art design are top-notch, creating a visually stunning experience. The sound design is solid, and while the music has its ups and downs, it definitely has a unique identity that complements the game well.For those familiar with Journey to the West or Chinese mythology, the reinterpretations of the characters are fascinating. If you’re new to the story, get ready for a wild ride—things can get pretty strange but are equally captivating.Now, let’s talk gameplay. It’s definitely fun and engaging, especially with the variety of enemies and the numerous boss encounters that bring their own quirks to the table. However, the combat system has its shortcomings. I was hoping for more combo options and a deeper combat system. As it stands, the combat relies heavily on waiting for special abilities to recharge and offers a limited variety of attacks with the staff. This can feel a bit restrictive, especially if you’re used to more fluid and responsive systems like those in DMC or recent God of War games.Despite this, the game is still incredibly enjoyable, and I’d recommend it without hesitation. It’s a fresh take on the action RPG genre with its own unique flair. If you’re a fan of Souls-like games with a twist or just looking for a compelling single-player experience, Black Myth: Wukong is definitely worth checking out.Final score (for now): 8.5/10. If the game surprises me with additional features or improvements, I’d be happy to bump that up to a 9. Overall, I’m thoroughly impressed."
Positive,"I am practically suffering on my bed half dying of covid, yet I still found time to beat this game, because it's so damn good. The amount of attention to the ancient Chinese art style is immeasurable, the boss fights are very tense, albeit I felt some of the later boss fights may have been too ""tanky"".But overall, this was a hella fun game, truly a game worth dying for. 9.1/10."
Positive,"I'm only about 7 hours in, and I am terrible at these souls-like games.  But this is fantastic.  Combat, enemy variety, story, visuals, voice acting (in Chinese AND English) are all amazing.  Occasional performance issues on a high end PC, but mostly still great.  Zero crashes.If you like souls games, or you are into mythology, the game is worth picking up."
Positive,back to back boss fights with smooth combat. I like it...
Positive,"Monkey hit with stick ooh ooh, big jump, stick long, graphics good, combat fun, story unique. Monkey happy."
Positive,Smokin' on that Monkey Pack.8/10 SOLID
Positive,Game of the year 4sure
Positive,"is a game for fans of journey to west, a game that i have dream for years!"
Positive,The game so far is an eye candy if your setup can support it. The graphic fidelity is pretty great and optimized. The story is engaging and I'll be looking forward to what it has to offer :). Controls are a bit weird but it was necessary and you adapt relatively quickly.
Positive,"Story, Characters, Locations are all fantastic. Most boss fights are really good visually and how they play, some are visually nice but as a fight terrible. Combat is fine. RNG drop rates are terrible."
Positive,I GET TO PLAY AS MONKE ME HAPPY
Positive,One of best games in recent years period! so much love and care went into game. 10/10 can recommend
Positive,"i have no words, sure the game has its rough edges, but hats off to everyone's involved and especially the development team, this truly is a moment to be celebrated in the gaming industry, thank you!"
Positive,"I didnt know anything about it, just saw high reviews and went for it.Great game so far, i'd call it souls-lite, much more forgiving in difficulty and punishment. You can die over and over here and lose nothing, you can respec everything for free at almost anytime. This game wants you to try all the different skills/builds without having to start over. Which is my biggest gripe with most rpg's, ""why do i have to play through again and again just to try different play styles""there is no gitting gud, i literally spam two buttons and im a Monkey God."
Positive,"First couple hours I was not feeling it and then it just clicked. the quests, the gear, leveling up and learning how the combat works, so many secrets and rewards for exploring. This game really won me over and I can totally understand all the critical acclaim."

Positive,"Just finished the game!Overall 9/10This game showed how much crap there is in gaming industry nowadays.1. No beta release! no lags, zero crashes no BS!! you are here to play not to pay to be a tester.2. No subscription fees, DLCs, micro transactions, live services, battle pass , you name it! finally you don't feel being scammed every five minutes3. No political / social / idiotic agendas. you are here to play and you get a game play!! not a ton of stupidity and developers pushing their mental issues on your screen. P.S: they talk about Buddhism charterers but obviously it's about fiction not to promote a religious monkey with a stick.4. Straight to the point game, no idiotic fillers and side quests of traveling 100 km to talk to NPC or spend 1 hour wondering how to fart next to a tree to move forward with the game.The good stuff:- Really polished game with zero issues as it should be- Graphics and details are great- Many unique bosses- Straight to the point game play- The music is EPIC- The story is nice even when you don't get the full picture (someone first time hears about journey to the west) and some parts gets emotional- Versatile things happens during the game and you won't get bored, the developer had the courage to unleash the creativity which is a big plus The bad stuff:- Confusing parts in the story for the ones who don't know (journey to the west)- Some dialog are weird and awkward that it's close to bad nonsense poetry- No mini map or any help to know where to go- Demanding on the hardware but hey that's totally understandable- The ending was nice but up to this game standards in my opinionOverall this game deliver atmosphere and a package very few games can deliver nowadays! it's like a relic you should obtain and admire.Still glad that all the studios are butt hurt right now 😁🤣"

Positive,Monkey Ring Elden King
Positive,monkey goes bonk.
Positive,"I say this shall be the game of the year.the game play manipulates the Dark Soul series, re-spawn, revenge, refill your potions, and kill the BOSS.But, what's outstanding is it's awesome move sets. Its not about mere dodging by clicking that one single button on your keyboard. Instead, you can dodge by climbing onto your weapon, using skills, and so much more...Its like a combination of EldenRing and Naraka, which gives you immersive feelings. It is very hard to describe, it's like Boxing in real life. You know when to through a punch and when not to. You know when to kick and when to dodge. Absolutely awesome experience. Its good to see a Made in China 3A video game went a step further and pursue whats beyond.Worth the price, highly recommend, take my money comrade."
Positive,GAME OF THE YEAR
Positive,Like the part where everyone says monkey like a racist grandpa
Positive,Nintendo really outdid themselves with this year's Donkey Kong.
Positive,fun black monkey game
Positive,"Yep, this is lovely.Insanely good game feel, insanely good graphics, insanely good sound design and performance is excellent... yep yep yep I love this. More games like this, please. monke hit with stick"
Positive,Bonk staff goes Bonk
Positive,"It's a great game, but FAIR WARNING to arachnophobes...  There are big spiders in this game...   Do your research before buying, ultimately I returned it due to this.   I can handle others like Bloodborne, but not this.   It joins the list with Skyrim and Hogwarts as games I won't play.  Other than that though it's a great game, I wish I didn't have the phobia so I could play it but don't really want to deal with these spiders."
Positive,"A game worth playing, trust me, you won't regret it."
Positive,very very very good
Positive,"After playing more and paying attention to the lore, i can say there's a reason it's the second most played game of all time on steam, with more than 600k positive reviews.Glory to 中国!"
Positive,"After completing Black Myth: Wukong, I’m eager to share my thoughts. While countless reviews have already been written, here’s my personal take on the game’s highlights and challenges.Based on Journey to the West, the game draws heavily from Chinese mythology, but I was pleasantly surprised by how the story unraveled. Rather than overwhelming players with lengthy cutscenes, Wukong cleverly allows those interested in deeper lore to explore journal anecdotes about characters. For example, after defeating a key character, I wanted more background and found it fascinating to read up on their history in the journal. This non-intrusive storytelling gives players the freedom to engage with the lore at their own pace, which I appreciated.Combat is the heart of any action RPG, and Wukong shines here. The gameplay feels fluid and rewarding, with responsive controls and impactful abilities. However, some of the boss fights are where the game’s challenge teeters toward frustration. Certain grab attacks, like the Yellow Wind Sage’s stomp, felt overly punishing. With an attack that deals 60% of your health in one hit and is nearly impossible to dodge on the first try, it often felt unfair rather than challenging. Balancing difficulty with fairness is key in a game like this, and though I found most of the combat satisfying, encounters like this could use fine-tuning.Outside of combat, the game offers a variety of potions and crafting options. It’s a bit confusing for new players, as there’s no clear indication of how or when you’ll need crafting materials, as you start collecting these from the beginning but gain access to crafting later down the line. Once I understood their uses, I appreciated how potions could either ease tough fights or be entirely avoided for a greater challenge. For example, amplifying damage with potions can make some of the easier bosses feel trivial, but I enjoyed the option to adjust the difficulty this way.Gathering materials is also well-designed. Items like wine worms and vines, crucial for upgrading your gourd / drink, are clearly highlighted, making it easy to spot valuable resources in the environment. Though not every crafting item is necessary, the game strikes a good balance between rewarding exploration and making these resources optional.The visuals are breathtaking, with each new area more impressive than the last. Exploring the world was a joy, not just for uncovering hidden secrets but for the sheer beauty of the environments. Wukong truly showcases the power of Unreal Engine 5, with detailed textures and lighting that make the world come alive.As for performance, I encountered no issues on my setup. The game ran smoothly throughout, which is a huge plus given how graphically demanding it is. The level of detail, from the lush landscapes to the intricate designs of the characters, is nothing short of remarkable.Note: My first ever crash of the game occured on NG+ after playing for 52 hours without any technical problems.Overall, Black Myth: Wukong delivers an exceptional experience. Its mix of deep lore, responsive combat, and stunning visuals makes it a standout action RPG. However, a few elements—like the overly punishing boss mechanics and unclear early-game crafting—hold it back from perfection.If you're on the fence, I’d say this game is worth the investment, especially if you’re a fan of mythological storytelling and challenging combat. And if you catch it on sale, don't hesitate—this game is a must-play for action RPG enthusiasts."
Positive,"评分：9.5/10首先声明，我手比较笨，接触类似的游戏也比较少，所以现在刚刚进入第二章。仅就目前的体验给予评价。优点：1、游戏性，作为传统动作RPG，游戏基本满足了我对类似游戏的期望——通过战斗积累经验以及相关资源，并以此提高自身能力从而挑战更高难度。技能看起来很多，或许会有不平衡的地方，但作为一款单机游戏，其影响不会太大。2、画面，非常优秀，没开光追和DLSS也能感受到整体画面的瑰丽，特别是以写实风格展现出的逼真的中国山水。开篇天庭的战斗场面里云雾缭绕的氛围也是十分出色。3、音乐，超出预期，无论是几次预告中所展现的音乐，还是第二章开篇之前没听过的秦腔，都展现了深厚的音乐创作能力——无论填词还是谱曲都满足了我对游戏内容的想象。可以说对一款不以音乐为卖点的游戏，实在是超出了我的预期。缺点：1、闪避判定似乎过于严苛了，又或者在进攻的过程中无法中断进攻进行闪避，这导致我感受到的游戏难度超出预期。总结：《黑神话：悟空》在游戏性没有特别出彩的情况下，实则在其他方面展现出了惊人的能力，着实将这款游戏变成了一部可以并且需要全方位欣赏的作品，整体品质令人惊叹。——————————————————————————Rating: 9.5/10First, I should clarify that I'm not very skilled with my hands, and I haven't played many games of this genre, so I've only just reached the second chapter. This review is based on my current experience.Pros:1. Gameplay: As a traditional action RPG, the game basically meets my expectations for this type of game—gaining experience and resources through combat to improve abilities and face more challenging difficulties. The skills seem plentiful, and while there may be some balance issues, since this is a single-player game, it shouldn't have too much of an impact.2. Graphics: Very impressive. Even without ray tracing and DLSS, the overall visual beauty is stunning, especially the realistic depiction of Chinese landscapes. The atmosphere in the opening battle in the Heavenly Court, with its swirling mists, is also exceptionally well done.3. Music: Exceeded my expectations. Whether it's the music showcased in the trailers or the Qin opera in the opening of the second chapter that I hadn't heard before, the music demonstrates strong compositional skills—both the lyrics and the score align with my imagination of the game's content. For a game that doesn't primarily focus on music, it truly surpassed my expectations.Cons:Dodge Mechanism: The dodge timing seems overly strict, or perhaps it's the inability to interrupt an attack to dodge that makes the game feel more difficult than expected.Summary:While <<Black Myth: Wukong>> doesn't particularly stand out in gameplay, it excels in other areas, turning the game into a piece of art that can and should be appreciated from all angles. The overall quality is truly remarkable."
Positive,Pixels dance on screen.Victory whispers softly.Joy in every move.
Positive,"To think that this is the studios first flagship AAA game, wow. If this game does not win GOTY I will be very disappointed. Game is absolutely incredible--from the incredible music to the graphics to the cinematography and the GAMEPLAY, wow, just wow. Incredible. It is basically like God of War with a little mix of soulslike and DMC action. The boss fights are on the level of the first 2 hours of GOW Ragnarok, and some are as large as FFXVI's. Truly a masterpiece of a game. I will be reading the Journey to the West novels because of this game. The cinematics at the end of each chapter have this distinct art style that just makes me so captivated. You can tell they put a ton of love and passion PURELY from those cinematics alone. I have never seen another game with such a style. I am not Chinese but I think Chinese culture is so incredible and interesting, massive respect to the studio for an amazing experience. What a game!"
Positive,"Performance aside as I have not had the issues mentioned elsewhere so far, this game is really amazing. Bosses are extremely fun, scenery is pretty good, combat is pretty deep, and I like how they did not go full souls-like. It feels more like God of War than a souls-like."
Positive,Reject woke modernity. Go back to monkey. Monkey always wins
Positive,Game Science poured so much love into this game.The final boss is one of the coolest fight in gaming. Definitely 10/10.Deserve to win game of the year.
Positive,"It sucks that I can only either recommend this game or not. I do think its a good game but not without it's flaws that clearly stems from the Studios lack of experience. Here are some of the issues I see so far:1. No Boss checkpoints. I cant remember the last game that had me walk to a boss from halfway of the map each time I died. It's not a game breaker but an aging design choice that even Fromsoft has abandoned.2. Cant skip phase cutscenes. I have to watch the phase transition each time I need to repeat the boss3. No audio Cues. This game has no audio cue for dodging nor does it give any visual cue either aside from the boss animation. I dont mind the absence of visual cue as long as there is an audio chime or something.4. Bugs. I've encountered several bugs so far from boss teleports around the stage to a mob flying into the sky to my enemies not regretting my hits.5. Game is confused. the game doesn't know what genre it wants to be which causes some fights to be a mess. on one hand you feel like this is a dodge and counter type boss but then it just wants you to mash buttons.This game has potential that I hope get addressed and fixed and like I said earlier this is clearly their first major game and they did a fantastic job but still needs some quality of life fixes.------------------------------------------------------------------Post completion Update:All the issues mentioned above are completely gone after chapter 2. I guess the first 2 chapters were done way early in development and not looked back at as much. The game is a solid 9/10 and it amazes me how a studio with no background in AAA titles can create something that is akin to a God Of War 2018/Rag.  3 Major things I wish they can fix:Map, please add a map. Doesn't need to be a mini map or a live tracker just something to know that I missed an area or something.Balance boss health pools: some bosses are only difficult because of their large health pool i think some balance may be good. Larger hit boxes on skinny legged large bosses (thousand eye and wise voice)"

Positive,After trouble shooting this game and discovering that my Processor was affected by the intel degrading issue. I am pleased to say that this game has been performing very well. Only thing i have run into is a save function that has popped up randomly. If you pc can run this game its very fun and not particularly difficult but very fun.
Positive,"So hear me out. I was always a console gamer, i played everything on controller.I got pc and i suck with mouse and keyboard, anyway i bought this game. I get for real war crimed on me first few hours with the first bosses.With every boss i defeat i feel a big accomplishment 👍 Why? Cause even the game is hard and i suck with mouse and keyboard, its to damn fun and thats how you get me hooked to the game and i am getting bit by bit better in the game, PERFECT COMBO.Next stop: Elden Ring after i beat this game.10/10 recommend this game."
Positive,"Right now it is unplayable. Can't get pass the 1st cinematic without crashing (tried 5x with different settings) and I have a AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT.Will update review later on once this is fixed or worked around.Edit:Seems to be a general issue with most AMD players. After searching for a workaround online i was able to pass the cinematic without crashing and the game now run well with no issues.As for the game it is AMAZING! Nothing bad to say about it so far, great fights and story!"
Positive,"SUN WUKONGFor Game Science's fiirst release it is simply amazing!Game needs to build up on the combat system allowing us to do cancels here and there so it flows better,world building is some of the best I have ever scene and characters are memorable."
Positive,Just here to give it the best score possible only to pissed off people who are against it. Those journalists about to be blown into space when they hear the games players count numbers and sales. Right in this moment! This feeling right here? It's what I live for. We are just like Son Wukong but instead of fighting against rules from above. We are fighting against crazy ideologies.
Positive,"The first time I saw the gameplay, I thought it was just another boring Souls-like game with the usual dodge/attack mechanics and lock-on system. But after playing a few chapters, I realized it’s much more than that. The visuals and combat animations are stunning, and the characters and elements inspired by Chinese mythology make it feel richer and more immersive than the typical 'soulless' Souls games from FromSoftware."
Positive,Embrace thy inner Monke

Positive,Game of the year!!!

Positive,"Fun game, no libtard bs makes it even better"
Positive,"Thank you for scratching my Sekiro itch,"
Positive,gourds out for Harambe
Positive,Two things I like:-1. Monkey2. Goth Girls
Positive,"The game features a masterful narrative with breathtakingly beautiful, lifelike environments. The intense and thrilling combat, along with the deep connections to the original story, make this game utterly captivating. The battles are challenging—there were bosses I had to fight over thirty times to finally defeat—but unlike Souls-like games, it never feels tedious. Without any death penalties, this game isn’t designed to punish you. In my view, Black Myth is a love letter from the developers to the players."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a pretty interesting game. The combat is fun and the game does a great job at making you feel extremely powerful. Bosses are for the most part also fun to fight and while many are pretty forgettable the good ones both look and feel absolutely incredible. The story is quite enjoyable as well and is told in a pretty interesting way. At some points it can be a bit confusing, but for the most part things make sense and it does not feel like things are meant to be 100% clear either so this is not really a downside. The main issues with this game unfortunately comes to certain bosses. For whatever reason a few bosses just have horrible hurtboxes where attacks will just go straight through their body from certain angles. You can always get to them from some angle, but it just feels terrible to deal with. I also think the game could be zoomed out a little bit as for some bosses the best place to look is at the very edge of the monitor. These issues can make certain areas feel awful to go through, but the game certainly has enough incredible segments for me to say it's still for sure worth playing."
Positive,"I'll rate it 8.5/10. Pretty good soulslike, its more God of War - China then a actual souls game though in terms of action. However a lot of the npc interactions and how they handle lore is more souls like. You would appreciate the game more if you read or watch Journey To The West before, going into the game without knowing the story is going to miss many references and even make the game harder from not knowing certain interactions. Took me around 40 hours to finish the game and there's a handful of challenging bosses, but mostly manageable as you have a ton of spells and tools to customize and use for any specific fights. Level design and invisible walls may need some work, which makes exploration a trial and error guessing game as you try to jump and roll over everything. On the other end, the art style, game setting and soundtracks are beautiful and exotic. Really good job on making this a unique experience."
Positive,"the sekiro 23456789 i always wantedif u keep getting lost, justkeep going leftor keep going right"
Positive,A mix of Sekiro/God of War with difficulty middling between fair and challenging. In terms of graphics this has to be the most beautiful game of 2024 so far.
Positive,monke dark souls?regardless very fun monkey-in around :D

Positive,"Only in a couple hours and can already see the time sink this is going to be. The action is fun and not too punishing, and I am no where near as frustrated as I was with the souls like games. The graphics are tremendous and the action smooth. With a little tweaking I have it running smoothly on a ROG Ally X, laptop with a 4070 ti, and a 7900XTX desktop. I highly recommend this to anyone."
Positive,"Great game, great combat, great visual/graphics, no bugs/crash so far, many many many enemy type(it's JTTW duh) and yay boss ""rush"", the cons is some effect heavy area/combat give you massive stutter/frame drop i had to change my graphic setting to the lowest just for a few hard battle with stutter looking at you Yin Tiger"
Positive,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" really blew me away. The gameplay is super fun, and every fight feels intense and thrilling, with skill combos that are incredibly satisfying. The scenery in the game is absolutely stunning; I often find myself just stopping to take in the view. The story is also fantastic—while everyone knows the ""Journey to the West"" tale, the way the game presents it is fresh and full of surprises. Overall, this game is definitely worth playing. Highly recommended!"
Positive,"Just get it even if you're worried about difficulty, just get it and play. Best game of the year hands down and sales/reviews shows that it is. No bs no weird agendas being pushed, a good true to haert, true to culture game made about one of the most legendary stories ever written. AND FUN TO PLAY, I've finished it twice now and I'm going for a 3rd round wish we can have more of these expenses.Also DLC... please, I heard rumblings but please make it happen"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong... Journos hate it because it's actually better than 95% of western slop out there. Or is it because they can't beat the first boss? Anyway... Uh, what's that? 10 million sales in just 3 days and the game's already become a global phenomenon? Wow would you look at that, maybe they hate it because it shows how irrelevant they are and they want to be the arbiters of taste (lmao). The more successful Monkey game is shoves that reality right in their faces. And why wouldn't it be successful, this game? It fucking rocks, it's probably the greatest cultural export from China in video game form. The gameplay is exciting and extremely fluid. The world is BEAUTIFUL. The forests, rocky wastelands interstrewn with masterfully crafted, 3D-scanned Buddhist temples really make for a world you don't mind the downtime between fights, because you're constantly in awe at the meditative environment. As for the history, you just can't go wrong with Asian mythology. It's so deeply Buddhist and philosophical that it is even part of the gameplay and exploration experience. Chapter 1's beautiful ending and the moral lessons it teaches blew me away. It's able to deliver its message succinctly without sounding preachy at all. + 1,000,000 Social Credit"
Positive,"This game was the first that I felt like I wanted to get all the achievements.  It was everything I wanted Dark Souls 3 to be with the excellent art, story, and game play."
Positive,"Good gameplay, stunning graphics, and, monke"
Positive,"runs flawlessly so far, 3080.  Stunning visuals on 4k.  Fun to play"
Positive,REJECT HUMANITY EMBRACE MONKESPIN TO WIN
Positive,"Just do it. This game exceeds the hype. From the smooth combat to the visuals, this is my personal contender for GOTY. A little bit of grinding will help in the initial boss fights. So far, at 2.4 hours in, the story seems faithful to the source material, a rarity in current era of entertainment. Game runs really well on my 4080 Super, 64gb RAM."
Positive,"Even just the intro was pretty great. You got a taste of Wukong's powers and got to try out the combat and get introduced to the story before being allowed to play as your actual character and the main game itself. I'm not usually a fan of games that make you lose all your cool powers after letting you try them out in the beginning because it usually feels cheesy losing everything in whatever way they decided you had to. Here, you're not even Wukong as far as I know. Just potentially a Destined One who will bring all six of his relics back to his mountain and revive him.You start off with just one stance and no spells, but by the time you finish the first chapter and beat it's end boss, you'll likely have at least 2 of the 3 stances, a couple spells to work with, a transformation you can use to soak up some damage because it has it's own HP bar, and a couple different armor sets with their own passive abilities to utilize. Along the way, you'll be leveling up and gaining ""Sparks"" that can be used to unlock things in the various skill trees. To not give too much away, just know that even beyond the tabs at the top that unlock as you progress thru the story and get more spells and transformations, the pages of those tabs themselves get more skills and/or skill trees as well when you get more spells and transformations. Meaning you're not seeing all the available options when you're looking at the spells and transformations pages. Since you can respec at any Shrine (checkpoints around the maps you can rest, swap out spells, reset skills, level up spirits, craft weapons/armor, change up your healing gourd's effects, and shop for various items using the Will gained from defeating enemies and bosses) you don't have to worry too much about ""wasting"" any Sparks while leveling up. Since you also don't lose any of that Will when dying, you don't have to worry too much about a lack of progression if you're struggling on a boss or in a certain area.Speaking of, I wanna take this opportunity to warn new players that the Wandering Wight in the first chapter can be skipped. You can run past it and come back later when you're stronger and have more options to deal with it. Think of it like the Draconic Tree Sentinel from the beginning of the open world of Elden Ring. It's a trap meant to frustrate you and waste your time. That said-make sure you come back and slaughter it when you think you can handle it. It's a great spirit to have.Spirits are not just temporary transformations you get that provide a different active effect during combat when you use them (I think the ability recharges from hitting/damaging enemies or resting at a shrine) but they also provide a passive effect just for having them equipped and Mr Wight there gives a nice +24 Defense. His ability has not just staggered every single boss I've used it on, but knocked them literally on their butts. Straight down to the ground and helpless for a bit while I just mercilessly assault them.Spirits and the major transformations you get are usually either bosses you've beaten before, or special elite versions one of the regular enemies in an area-such as a rat archer. The spirits can be improved at Shrines using Will and certain upgrade materials. So if you really like one, you can usually improve it's ability a couple of times. The regular transformations get their own skill node from the 2 I've seen so far.The maps/areas are a mix of pretty linear sections and bigger sections with a lot of side areas to explore and various quests you can do. Both chapters I've completed so far each also had their own secret area to unlock and find as well as an item meant to help you with that chapter's specific end boss. If you find yourself struggling in any chapter, go back thru old places you've been and see if you missed anything. There are a surprising amount of secrets in the game-similarly with side quests.I know the game gets billed as a souls-like and while I can't deny it definitely has some elements of those games, it reminds me more of the new God of War games if they borrowed similarly from the souls games in the way that this one was inspired to do so. Not just from the cutscenes and story that's doled out much differently than any Souls game would do-but the combat itself and many of the areas and the loot system all remind me more of action-RPGs than any Souls game or clone would go for. It's MUCH more action packed than any Souls game. I feel more like I'm bullying the enemies and bosses than like I'm struggling against or dancing back and forth with them waiting for my turn to get hits in. No-instead, I have so many methods of making sure they can't do anything to me. From the immobilizing spell, to the cloud step spell that makes me invisible and leaves a decoy they attack instead, to that Wight's powerful slam, to my charged heavy attacks that often stagger them-I'm on the offensive more often than not.Don't get me wrong, it's still a fairly difficult game-especially the boss of chapter 2 (and to some degree the boss of the first chapter as well). It's just that this game clearly wants to make you feel like you're a powerful entity yourself and have every tool at your disposal you would need to deal with any of these bosses or enemies challenging you. It's going to knock you down and you will lose sometimes and likely struggle more than you'd expect at certain bosses or areas, but you can rest assured that it's not trying to be like the Souls games and make you die time and time again until you learn all the attack patterns of all the bosses to keep progressing because you don't need to play anywhere near flawlessly.Beyond all the ways to stun bosses, you not only have the Gourd that can be upgraded to increase how many times it can be used and how much it heals per use, but you can use a ""Soak"" and give it a passive effect when used-such as being unable to be stunned/knocked out of using it-AND you can switch out the gourd itself (the gourds have passive effects) AND you can switch out the Brew inside the gourd. Different brews provide different healing methods and they're what's upgraded to improve how much it heals. Then you can also make Medicines that provide temporary buffs such as reduced damage taken, negating the various elemental effects, and boosting max HP. You can equip 4 of them at once, but different Medicines have different limits on how many you can carry at once before you have to rest at a Shrine to replenish it.In all, I highly recommend this game if you either liked the God of War games, action-RPGs in general, or even any of the Souls games/Elden Ring. It's a wonderfully designed game and I came to make this review after I beat the boss of the 2nd chapter. I was and am blown away by how good that boss fight is and how many different moves that boss had to use. I don't mean to make it sound like an insanely complex fight-I just mean that the boss had a wide enough variety of moves to use to keep the fight interesting that I wanna fight him again at least a few more times. He was that much fun-even though I died more to him than any boss before him. By a noticeable amount. Anyway, just check the game out. I got nearly 30hrs of gameplay out of 2 chapters in this game. I think there's at least 4. Do with that information what you will. I also heard there's a NG+ when you beat it and at least 2 endings depending on what you do thru the game."
Positive,"🎀I have never seen such quality in any other game. Adapting the story from the Chinese novel Journey to the West must have been incredibly difficult, yet these developers in their first AAA  without a publisher, because they self-published it, without the need for third-party publishers have managed to sell over 20 million copies for a single-player game. I’m on my third playthrough ng+3 and I just can’t stop playing. The story is so beautiful and emotional. There are many secrets or hidden areas to discover, some of which are only accessible through side quests. The game world and the setting are incredibly varied and realistic, I’ve never seen such quality in any other game. The developers clearly put a lot of love and money into this masterpiece. I haven’t encountered a single bug,none! The optimization is perfect, as long as you have a good PC.I have to eat my words from my previous negative review where I complained about the privacy settings. It turns out, you just have to disable that option, and it only concerns the use of the software (the game), nothing else. I managed to create a build with all the mythological equipment, and it’s so much fun to play, combining different abilities, finding collectibles, and discovering new characters who share their stories. I don’t even know what else to say because I’m speechless. If this first game sold over 20 million copies, it just shows that the Asian market (on their first try) is capable of doing a thousand times better than the western market, which is practically dead now. There’s hardly anything left that interests me or is worth paying attention to. All I see are repeated or copied games. Wukong is different in every way. The gameplay mechanics change with each NG+, they’re not the same as the first playthrough, but I won’t spoil anything. To me, Wukong is worth even twice its price, and I definitely would’ve bought it even if it had cost twice as much.The story of this game is really impressive and all the main characters are realistically engaging.DEVELOPER: Game SciencePUBLISHER: Game SciencePublished by them and with little marketing they have proven that you don't need to be published by anti-consumer companies like Sony or Microsoft who are now a general embarrassment. The next game from Game Science will surely be beautiful as Wukong (which deserves a GOTY in my opinion) or even better if they stick with their mentality.I still remember how IGN and Kotaku tried to blackmail the developers by trying to steal 7 million dollars in exchange for positive reviews, otherwise the game would be destroyed; they voted Concord (an inclusive woke game with transsexuals that died after a few days) with higher votes than Wukong because it is not inclusive, really embarrassing, but even more embarrassing to see how much ignorance reigns in the west and not only in the gaming field. These capitalist materialists, who I despise, for me have no soul or brain and much less culture, miserable lives without a purpose."

Positive,"The darkhorse game of the year we all didn't know we needed. In a time of day one DLC bedbug infested pay-to-win idiocratic corporate AAAA dumpster fires, a game, no.... a cultural experience emerges that beckons to a time when as wee little gamers, joy filed our hearts as we pulled a disc or cartridge from a box and and your screen lit up taking you on an unparalleled adventure of mystery and exploration. The Chinese developer Game Science captured our innate exploratory spirit and were patient in with their passion project delivering a famous Chinese mythological masterpiece utilizing the new Unreal Engine 5. From the fluid combat to the world design to the historical lore to be discovered and learned, the story of Wukong breathes fresh air into the worlds highest grossing entertainment industry reminding us of those golden gaming days."

Positive,"Awesome graphics, awesome game-play, awesome story. Love it"
Positive,Wukong is in the house
Positive,needs some more optimization atm but very fun
Positive,This game changed my life.
Positive,"This game overall is much better than I expected. Despite owning several 'souls-like' games, this was my first serious attempt at the style of game. While it's not without flaws, such as occasional camera issues or hitbox glitches, the overall gameplay and experience are exceptional.With the vast amont of boss fight in this game, it doesn't feel repetitive at all since all the bosses are different. Is easily one of the best titles I've played in recent memory.This is definitely GOTY for me."
Positive,"This game has lived up to every expectation. It feels like a combination of Sekiro and Stellar blade with a pinch of Nioh. It's not considered a souls like but it's definitely punishing so if you're not into harder games it may not be for you. I love that the developers showed gameplay a long time ago and it still looks the same. Puts a lot of developers to shame and they need to learn from this game.Highly recommend this game, GOTY 2024 for sure."
Positive,It got monkey.
Positive,"Very good, very DEI free!"
Positive,So far great game a little too easy but still fun
Positive,One of my games of the year and one of the best games I've played in 2024.
Positive,good game with rich chinese culture
Positive,"I'm pretty much on the fence with this game. I feel like if you never read the books it's based off of, you're going to be absolutely clueless on what's going on with the story. The story feels so random and I don't know what is going on at all and the developers don't explain anything. That being said, if it weren't for the combat and boss fights being amazing I would've refunded this game within an hour easily.TL;DR: Don't go in thinking it's like Dark Souls or Elden Ring. This is not a souls-like game. It's more Souls-Lite and not as difficult as an actual Souls-like game.If you don't know the story, you're going to enjoy this game only for its combat and boss fights. Maps are linear, visually appealing, but limited. Works well with mouse & keyboard and you cannot rebind keys.The Monkey's voice acting is horrid. To me, should be deeper. As I mentioned above, I'm clueless with how the story is. All I know is I'm a monkey that's either a descendant of another monkey that's supposed to start small and go big again to be a great, powerful monkey. Game Science doesn't explain the story well or explain it throughout the game so you know what's going on. The game is built in chapters and once starting each chapter you're thrown in without any explanation on how you got there or why you're this monkey fighting his way to the top.Game is made up in chapters. You aren't limited to only being in one chapter and are able to travel to previous maps to finish exploring. However, this is not open world and the maps are a 'set path' forcibly telling you where to go. Chapter 1 is a very small map, but once you progress it does seem the maps get bigger. But, you still cannot go where you please, only where they want you to go. As I mentioned, it's a VERY linear experience.This game is built in Unreal Engine 5 so ultimately it looks good, turns your PC into the Sun with lots of heat coming out. I have a high-end PC and I do hit a lot of lag spikes and stutters in some areas, but they tend to go away quickly. My GPU drivers are up-to-date too.Combat is where I commend this game. It's VERY good and satisfying. Lots of skills to acquire and combos to learn, but each stance can be used in perfection with each other in certain situations to save you or deal lots of damage. They give you A LOT of things to use. At first, it's overpowered until you start to progress, then everything seems to balance out. I'm using mouse & keyboard and don't have an issue with it.Once you level, you will earn a point to put to your skills. There's character stats but it's not your typical souls-like where you'll earn stat points too. Later on you can upgrade your stats through a specific way, but you need a rare item to do so.You have a normal dodge and a perfect dodge. Perfect dodge is when you basically dodge less than 100 milliseconds from getting hit. It's satisfying when you perfect dodge.Most bosses are easy, too easy, and you will most definitely notice it. This isn't Elden Ring -- so chances are if you die on a boss, you're going to go back and easily destroy them. I died more at the beginning learning than I do now with more skills at my disposal and more understanding on combo utilization. Now, boss fights do get insane and more enjoyable through the game. There's a lot of 'mini-bosses' I feel, but once you start fighting the major bosses, everything you do is satisfying.Bosses don't have their normal ""I'm a boss so I won't get staggered a lot because I'm a big badass"". You can knock a boss down easily and continuously. That's what makes the combat so satisfying.You do gather resources in the game for consumables and overall crafting. There aren't different weapons in this game which I found a let-down. You basically only upgrade the staff you start with to make it more powerful. It gets costly later on too.I feel armor is only useful when you unlock it. So if you craft an armor set during a chapter, then you unlock another armor set, chances are you're going to use the new armor set. Armor does have bonuses, but your defense rating is hindered depending on which armor you equip. Maybe they want you to equip the armor for a build you're going for at the cost of getting hit hard? Not sure, but the way I see it is the old gear kinda gets useless as you're progressing.You can craft potions as well. Not much to it but some potions you'll need to unlock.You cannot rebind any keys. I wanted to rebind my dodge and jump and you're forced to keep everything default. Not sure why in 2024 we aren't able to rebind a key, it's absurd. There's auto jump in the game too and with how linear the maps are -- not sure why jump is in the game besides jump attacks via combat.Black Myth: Wukong released at a good time. After Elden Ring's DLC, people were itching for more Souls-like entertainment, and they were smart about it. To me, that's where most of its hype came from. I don't understand the story at all. The story is very random, but the combat and boss fights are well done and will keep me playing. If I had to suggest something, I'd wait for a sale, but if I were you, I'd go ahead and try it out to see if you like it or not."

Positive,"As an elder gamer, I do not have fast response. I have not enjoyed soul like games before but purchased this one by recommendation from friends. so I was a bit worried when purchasing the game. However 12hrs in so far, I enjoyed the game so much.It offers beautify graphics, amazing audio, story is after the timeline of Journey to the west so may be a bit hard to follow for some. Not an issue for me since I have good knowledge around Journey to the west.Boss fights are epic and challenging but not feeling impossible. My feeling is that the difficulty on bosses are not linearly increased. I've spent lots of time on one of the bosses at the very beginning but a few following ones felt much easier.In general, I'd recommend Black Myth: Wukong to anyone."
Positive,"My rating; 9/10My expectations were not that high before the release. I played with RT 6900XTPros: + An amazing variation of bosses.+ Beautiful and fluid combat.+ So many secret bosses, chests, areas that encourages you to explore.+ Stunning visuals and beautiful optimization+ Codex stories are wild!+ Interesting CharactersCons: - Invisible walls are a hindrance, not because they are there, but because you think there is a place you can go, but you can't and you just wasted your time.- Stances could be more interesting if they could change our combos.- We should have been able to mix light and heavy attack. - So many summons, but most of them are inferior to some spesific summons/transformations.For me, this is the best game in 2024,including FF 7 Rebirth, And it should at least have a 85 metacritic. They did this dirty."
Positive,Amazing quality...Boss fights are hard AF tho
Positive,Return to Monke
Positive,"🐢: Mmm, monkey."
Positive,"I played the Chinese version and read the English dialogue. The game's concept is quite thought-provoking.There are some differences between the Chinese and English versions. The English version removed elements that require cultural context, like Sun Wukong calling Erlang Shen his nephew. It also explicitly states Sun Wukong's desire for freedom at the beginning, making it more accessible to a broader audience. The English ending also omits the Journey to the West TV series theme music.The game centers on freedom, a rather modern theme. Since China's New Culture Movement, with the advent of Mandarin and reinterpretation of classics, there's been a trend to uncover rebellious themes in traditional stories. For example, Sun Wukong's drunken mischief is now seen as defying authority. Some conspiracy theory criticisms aren't really about the game itself, but reflect a century-long cultural shift.The developers are like gods, and players are like mortals. This makes it challenging to effectively portray a theme of rebelling against authority. Perhaps that's why the game's plot is intentionally vague. However, the story clearly opposes immortality, suggesting that Wukong dies and there won't be a traditional Journey to the West. It's more about a mental journey, without heaven or fate - just humans who must create their own destiny by stepping away from the game. Some fans speculate about Wukong's resurrection or future havoc in heaven, but that would contradict the anti-immortality stance.This reimagining portrays Tang Seng (Tripitaka) as less pedantic and elevates Jinchanzi's role. The cycle in the game resembles a Matrix-like allegory. Staying in the cycle might mean powering some entities, like Guanyin and the Architect, while breaking free might empower others, like Jinchanzi and the Oracle. In Black Myth's context, ""powering"" likely means providing fodder for Buddhist debates. But as long as debates continue, we're still seeking truth and intellectual freedom. From this view, no character - foreground or background - has truly achieved Buddhahood. A true Buddha, if one exists, might be beyond any narrative or discourse.In debates, actions speak louder than words. Ultimately, whatever we do empowers someone. Empowering others doesn't mean we lack freedom; it shows our agency. Freedom manifests through our choices. As long as we're choosing, we're moving towards freedom.So what choice did the player make? In games, truly meaningful choices might not exist. Players adapt to the environment, but the environment doesn't adapt to players. Especially in a game designed with set triggers and outcomes, players can only explore what the developers have created. This isn't really choice - it's like a traversal program that optimizes its process but can't truly choose.In this context, the only real choice is to stop playing and engage with real life - like a program that can refuse to traverse."
Positive,"I don’t bother to write reviews most of the time, but this game surprised me. Lots of fun to be had. The graphics are next level. GOTY? Maybe.My only complaint is the lack of native HDR. Fortunately, RTX HDR does a pretty good job here."

Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is nothing short of a masterpiece, a game that not only lives up to the hype but also redefines what it means to create a AAA title rooted in Chinese culture and mythology. As someone who grew up with the countless adaptations of Journey to the West and holds Sun Wukong as a childhood hero, I was eagerly anticipating this game ever since its first trailer was released four years ago. The wait was worth every second.From the moment you step into the world of Black Myth: Wukong, it's clear that the developers at Game Science have poured their heart and soul into every aspect of the game. The story, deeply inspired by the legendary novel Journey to the West, resonates with a familiarity that feels both comforting and exciting. The story, which picks up after Journey to the West, pulls you into a darker, more intricate mythology. The protagonist, referred to as the Destined One, channels the spirit of Sun Wukong with a ferocity and grace that make him instantly relatable to anyone who knows the lore. The action gameplay is a breath of fresh air, offering a perfect blend of challenge and reward. The combat mechanics are fluid, with the Ruyi Jingu Bang (the iconic staff) providing a versatile and exhilarating experience. The three staff stances—smash, pillar, and thrust—add layers of depth to the combat, making each encounter feel dynamic and strategic. The ability to accumulate focus and execute devastating combos adds a satisfying rhythm to battles, making every victory feel earned.Even as someone who isn’t particularly skilled at action games, I found the balance just right. The combat can be challenging, especially when trying to read boss attack patterns and dodging at the right time, which I myself am not very good at, but Black Myth: Wukong offers a way for everyone to enjoy. The items, weapons, elixirs, and transformation abilities are incredibly helpful in making difficult fights more manageable. It’s not just about skill; it’s also about strategy, exploration, and smart use of in-game resources, which makes it accessible even for players like me who aren’t experts in ARPGs.One of the most exciting features of Black Myth: Wukong is the protagonist's ability to shapeshift into various creatures, each with its own moveset and abilities. These transformations are not just gimmicks; they are integral to the gameplay, offering fresh strategies and keeping the combat experience diverse and engaging. The spells and spirits add another layer of customization, allowing players to tailor their playstyle to their preferences.One of the most striking aspects of the game is its stunning environment design. The world of Black Myth: Wukong is a visual feast, filled with breathtaking scenery that captures the essence of ancient China. The attention to detail in the landscapes, from the mist-covered mountains to the tranquil rivers, is nothing short of awe-inspiring. The environments are meticulously crafted, creating breathtaking scenes that feel as if they've leapt straight out of a dream. Powered by Unreal 5 and NVIDIA's RTX technology, the game's settings are immersive and lifelike. I’m playing on a setup with an i5-13600KF and an RTX 4070ti, and the game runs beautifully, even with RTX on. There’s even a meditation feature that lets you soak in the views from various angles—something I often use to appreciate just how gorgeous this world is. It's a world that feels alive, vibrant, and rich with history. The art direction deserves special mention for its creativity and uniqueness. The characters and enemies are meticulously crafted, each with a distinct personality that reflects the mythology from which they are drawn. What I love is how the game fleshes out each yaoguai’s background with the Yaoguai Portraits, offering a rich world-building experience. These details make the journey not just an action-packed adventure but also a deep dive into Chinese folklore, something that resonated with me as someone familiar with Sun Wukong's epic tale.The music and sound design are equally impressive, perfectly complementing the game's atmosphere. The score is a beautiful fusion of traditional Chinese instruments and modern orchestration, creating an auditory experience that is both immersive and emotionally resonant. It elevates every moment, from the quiet contemplation of a shrine to the adrenaline-pumping intensity of a boss fight.In my view, Black Myth: Wukong isn’t just an incredible action RPG; it’s a milestone for Chinese game developers. It’s the first AAA title developed by a Chinese studio, and it’s clear they’ve poured their heart and soul into every detail. This game is a love letter to Chinese mythology, and as someone who holds this mythology close to my heart, I couldn't be more thrilled with how it turned out.Black Myth: Wukong is a triumph in every sense of the word. It’s a game that honours the legacy of Journey to the West while forging its own path with innovation, creativity, and sheer passion. Whether you're a fan of the novel, a lover of action RPGs, or simply someone looking for an unforgettable gaming experience, Black Myth: Wukong is a must-play. Whether you’re a seasoned ARPG player or someone like me who’s just here for the adventure, Black Myth: Wukong has something magical to offer."
Positive,this shit good
Positive,"Now this... this is a great game. This is how you should do single player cinematic action RPG games. They learned all the good lessons from both God of War and soulslike games, all in one amazing package."
Positive,Amazing game. Good mechanics. Leaves out the unfun stuff of souls-likes.
Positive,Can someone reset my mind?I'd like to play it agaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin

Positive,"7/10 New to reviews but... i really enjoyed every hour of this game. Throughout the bullshit deaths, some questionable map designs and horrible camera angels, i still found myself captivated in the adventure it took me through. Its not really much else to say besides yes, yes i do recommend it."
Positive,"monke see. monke atackNot really my kind of game but it got me hooked really good. I think it can be actually accessible for anybody,  just grind your way into higher level and still be able to progress even if u suck at this kind of game. Incredible good job with this one"
Positive,i love china and the chinese communist party
Positive,"Never been a fan of hearing what others think about the game.so I'll just go ahead and confirm that it's a game and you can play it,it's good too~end of review"
Positive,my dumbass did not upgrade my gourd until i got to chapter 4. I was playing this game on literal hardcore mode
Positive,Review after beating the game with multiple endings around 60 hours playtime. 6 chapters 6 beautiful stories (Better than Disney). Amazing soundtrack and so many secret areas and hidden quests. 10/10 GOTY !!
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong delivers an unforgettable experience with breathtaking visuals and unforgettable boss fights. There is a wide array of enemy variety and unique boss designs that keeps you on your toes. It is impressive how visually and mechanically different each of the boss fights are, I was constantly impressed with each new area I found myself in and with each new boss I stumbled upon. There are so many combat abilities and transformations at your disposal, I never felt myself getting bored with the gameplay and exploration.The game is a visual treat with its impressive cinematics, gorgeous character and architecture designs. The game comes with a wonderful soundtrack and story to go along with it. The companion character Baije has easily become one of my favourite videogame characters. Wukong is a beautifully crafted game that genuinely delivers a stylish grand odyssey."
Positive,"60h at New Game + :二者择一下，我将毫不怀疑地选择thumbs up，这尊重了我所真实体验到的旅程和创作者们，但这不代表在讨论印象时总会对此美言。对期待动作交互深度和关卡设计的玩家来说，该作很可能是瑕将掩瑜的状态。视听体验非常成功。无论是法天象地大战，残躯对决，还是各关底妖王的表现力与章节总结都让我回味无穷。二郎神、小黄龙、寅虎、大圣残躯等怪物的设计达到了良好而合理的交互效果。然而，绝大部分妖王和头目的设计很难恭维，它们的深度与合理性与关卡路径设计一齐拖累了作品整体的印象分。见对故事有微词者众多。我认为，不只有宏大和超脱凡俗的圣人史诗才值得欣赏。很多时候，英雄也和民众面临着相似的困境。英雄总是受人尊敬的缘由并非能力超群，而是面对不可为的勇气和做出选择的魄力。红尘蜉蝣，凡夫俗子，亦可为英雄。--8h:In initial experience as a Chinese proficient, the art, lines, and music are particularly shocking. I watch the English clip online and believe their translation is also pretty good. Though if you can read and speak Chinese, the lines are unrivaled. It is not a flaunt exaggeration or something, but probably the truth. A notable flaw is the path design, which reminds me of Team Ninja's works. (but don't gemme wrong, I still love Ninja's games :P)Apart from all the details, it should be one of the largest action-game in the history of video games to date (I think FF16 is THE largest if it counts as a true-action-game...?). No reasons for not giving it a try as a game lover."
Positive,"Truly an impressive Triple A level title from Game Science. After about 60 hours, I've finally seen the conclusion of the story. There are still a few things to collect, but I've seen every boss at this point. Black Myth Wukong is rich with mythology and story. The extended lore on characters is further expanded in the journal as you progress.This is a very strong debut game from Game Science, and I'll be very interested in future titles from this studio.Positives:-Interesting story-Beautiful visuals and stable performance. I noticed frame drops on entering new areas, but my 1080TI made it through the game without much trouble. Never experienced a game crash.-Challenging bosses, some of which can match difficulties from the Dark Souls Franchise.-Various upgrade paths and abilities to choose from.-Different staff weapons and armor to craft. Several Staves are viable late-game.-Reassign skill points at any time at a rest point.-Fast Travel to previous areas, regardless of story progression.Negatives:-Some bosses have poorly telegraphed attacks. There are a lot of bosses, but the quality lacks in readable attack patterns and hitboxes for a few bosses.-Limited healing drink upgrade materials. You can fully upgrade the Gourd, but you cannot fully upgrade the default drink. You must replay in new game+ to finish.-Limited early game spirit upgrade materials. Limits experimentation of Spirits until late-game.-Crazy amount of invisible walls. Map design could have utilized more cliffs and obstacles to obscure out of bounds areas.-No map or quest tracker. It benefits immersion, but many side quests massively improve your chances against the final boss of each chapter. This may push some players to seek online information to progress."
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong turned out to be a game far beyond our expectations. This is a game that more than ever represents its market: it's imposing, impressive, at times exceptional, but at the same time, it focuses too much on technical impact and large-scale elements, neglecting important details and falling into oversights one wouldn't expect from a team with such technical capabilities. It remains an extremely varied and enjoyable action game, with unique qualities and some truly high moments"

Positive,"monke, chapter 2 starting song is peak"
Positive,"The difficulty is a bit high, but it's so good. The art is excellent, and the gameplay is very creative. It is vastly different from traditional triple-A games, with a strong Eastern flavor."
Positive,so far I'll say its a masterpiece. Just saying guys
Positive,"Absolutely amazing game. Cinematic gameplay, cinematic graphics plus combat. Amazing story with brilliant Chinese lore, just an overall amazing experience that respects its fans and spits on journos who want to destroy this game with their BS agenda. We don't need that shit in our games. Journalists would give it 10/10 if it was ""Black Chick With-Dong"" instead.Looking forward to see more AAA titles from Chinese devs in the future. 10/10"
Positive,"MONKEEEEECombat is great, Environment is great Enemies are diverse Skill tree is hugeSoundtrack is killerOnly downside is that there seems to be slight stutters here and there, nothing game-breaking but they are noticeable. Also inputs are sometimes wonky. IE, I'd heal with my gourd, HEAR THE DRINKING NOISE, and not heal or do the animation."
Positive,"At first I just liked it, and disagreed with the people calling it GOTYUltimate super ultra graphics, game looks so good it made me dizzy once because my brain couldnt process how good it looks, plus the optimization is really good, very rare to see these days.Frame generation + RTX doesnt make my PC reach Tungsten melting point.Gameplay is a mix of God of War + Sekiro + Dark souls.I strongly suggest reading ""Journey To The West"" first if you havent already."
Positive,Killed the first boss (the large white wolf) on my first try when I thought I died. He had more health than me and we hit each other and the screen went into slow motion thinking I died but I didnt read the word defeated on screen till a few seconds later and I was like damn I won. I'll never forget that moment. Great game! Doesnt play like fromsoft games so dont go in expecting it. Gives a more god of war type vibe. Not a deal breaker but there is no in-game map.
Positive,11 hours on first session
Positive,"One of the best single player experiences ever, cannot recommend it enough."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is all about serious monkey business. Brutal, beautiful, and Bananas without the bananas!"
Positive,Doesn’t have DEI poison in it. 10/10.
Positive,"Let me Just say firstly i was gifted this by the Legend Okumuura , one of the MVP in my community.and that aside I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this game hOnestly.My best way to explain this game , as a God of War mixed with Devil my Cry with a bit of sprinkles of EldenRIng slight sprinkles !!! If you Love Mythology type of games and and Wukong and you love boss Fights this is a Must for you !!!!  YES just GET THIS ITS AMAZING."
Positive,not a fan of dying over and over again till you finally beat the boss. would rather have a cinematic experience not cock and ball torture. but this is all a skill issue ik just me personally not a fan. if you like souls games youll love this
Positive,"No wokeness, no political correct, no sweet baby inc, only for gamer like good old day.Oppose feminist and LGBT organizations; we need games to return to normal and break free from the hijacking of these disgusting groups.Of course, its a  perfect  good game. I love it so much. Thank you, Game Science."
Positive,runs great and no crashes. That's all that matters to me.
Positive,This is the greatest experience of my life!
Positive,"The game fits that nice difficulty between action adventure games and souls-like, difficult but not demotivating when you get your ass kicked."
Positive,"This game is nothing short of a breathtaking experience. From the moment you step into its richly detailed world, you can feel the care and craftsmanship that went into every aspect of the game. The visuals are stunning, with environments that are not only beautiful but also incredibly immersive. Each location is meticulously designed, drawing inspiration from Chinese mythology in a way that feels both authentic and fantastical.The combat system is a standout feature, offering a perfect blend of challenge and satisfaction. Every encounter feels meaningful, requiring skill and strategy rather than button-mashing. The variety of enemies keeps the gameplay fresh, and the boss battles are nothing short of epic, each one a unique test of your abilities.But what truly elevates ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is its storytelling. The narrative is deep and engaging, weaving together familiar tales from ""Journey to the West"" with fresh twists that keep you hooked from start to finish. The protagonist, Sun Wukong, is brought to life with a complexity and depth that makes his journey all the more compelling.Had a blast so far, highly recommended."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is visually stunning, this is certainly the best use of Unreal Engine 5 we've seen so far.The game looks absolutely gorgeous, there is so much details it's unbelievable.From characters and monster designs to the environments everything looks fantastic.The level design on the other end is nothing special, it can be confusing in some places and there's way too many invisible walls.Sadly the combat and gameplay in Black Myth: Wukong are far from perfect.There's way too much input delay, too much stunlocks and the most annoying for me was the fact that there is no animations canceling.The combat is still highly enjoyable but it's not technical or varied enough for me.Don't get me wrong the game is still well worth playing if you like the genre but I expected better.The difficulty for some bosses is unfair and hitboxes are complete trash sometimes.Overall Black Myth: Wukong is still a really good and Game Science truly delivered something amazing.If there's future dlc's with new content I'll be sure to buy them day one.Well recommended."
Positive,"Fun combat, great art. Amazing music videos. Mediocre level design filled with invisible walls."
Positive,Fkin AMAZING game.
Positive,"Facts have proved that some excellent cultural works, such as Journey to the West, will still shine in the future. Their light comes not only from the words, but from the story itself, but also from the eternal humanism spirit they represent!事实证明，有些极其优秀的文化作品即时度过了千百年的时光，依然会在当下，在未来大放异彩，比如《西游记》。它们的光芒不仅仅来源于文字，来源于故事本身，更来源于其所代表的永恒的人文主义精神！"

Positive,No Sweet Baby ☑No DEI ☑Optimization ☑Soulslike ☑Harambe ☑Great Graphics ☑Solid Gameplay ☑Based Developers ☑Overall big W for gamers
Positive,"I have about 25 hours in this game currently since release date; been taking my time, exploring every nook and cranny (though the invisible walls are HELLA ANNOYING) and investing myself in all the lore with the enemy short stories and I'm only probably halfway done with Ch. 2.Been avoiding all spoilers and playing mostly blind as that's the best way to play in my opinion and given that I've been playing Demons Souls since '09 I'm familiar with the tricks with hidden bosses / secret areas and backtracking with an acquired item and figuring that stuff out so it's not too bad for me due to my experience with the genre.The game is more ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game) with shared elements of the Souls games and though some of the bosses I've encountered have frustrated me, I'm also having FUN, which says a lot and the feeling of finally defeating an enemy is extremely liberating and euphoric. You can tell this game was made with so much love and I can't recommend it enough, just give it a try!"
Positive,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a visually stunning action RPG inspired by the classic Chinese novel *Journey to the West*. From the moment you dive into its world, the game captivates with breathtaking environments and top-tier graphics that showcase impressive attention to detail. The character designs, particularly the protagonist Sun Wukong, are meticulously crafted, blending mythological elements with a gritty, realistic art style.The combat is fast-paced, fluid, and challenging, featuring a variety of transformative abilities that Wukong can use to adapt to different enemies. Each encounter feels epic, with boss fights that are both visually spectacular and mechanically engaging, requiring players to think tactically rather than rely on brute force.Narratively, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" promises an intriguing and mysterious story, drawing on rich Chinese folklore. The game does a fantastic job of balancing its mythological roots with fresh, creative interpretations of legendary creatures and figures. If the full game maintains the quality showcased in its trailers and previews, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is poised to be a groundbreaking title, offering a rich, immersive experience for fans of both action RPGs and mythological storytelling."
Positive,"1ST PLAYTHROUGH (15 HRS): all i have to say is that this game is GOTY worthy. the art, fluidity of combat, story, cutscenes, insane graphics, awesome souls type level design, sick bosses, awesome armor...i don't think there is anything i can say i am NOT enjoying about this game. it's got challenge, the dodges are A FUCKING 1. i could go on and on. been waiting for this game for such a while it feels like and it's so worth the wait. i haven't had this much fun with a game since my first playthroughs of the souls and final fantasy series. im excited to go back and get the secret stuff i missed, as well as grab the rest of achievements for a plat. i will 100% update this review afterwards. this game IS shorter then they are making it out to be as well, restrictive exploration forsure but i am not against that at all. give me BOSS, BOSS AND MORE BOSSES. LET'S FUCKING GO.UPDATE AFTER PLAT (44 HRS): THIS GAME IS A FUCKING MASTERPIECE. game science absolutely cooked for their first game and while tons can argue there could be a lot different of things to work on, they still did fucking amazing for their first console/pc game, especially with the transition of only making mobile games. if this is only their first game, who knows what even better quality could come with a DLC or another game. this game truly is a game-changer for foreign studios and the fact that they also gave SBI the finger is another reason to love this game. this was one of the best weeks of my life just grinding the hell out of this game. this is something i will not forget, celebrate game science, y'all deserve it. what a fucking HIT."
Positive,Monke do bonk to kill boss
Positive,2nd best game about monkeys
Positive,"With no Soulslike experience besides one Elden Ring playthrough as overpowered mage, this is certainly a change of pace. Doubly so with the controller I don't use particularly often. And yet, I just liked how melee combat felt from the very first moment on. I never felt unable to comprehend why I just got my ass kicked by something and in general, I certainly felt overwhelmed a lot but never like things became unfair. The satisfaction from chaining combos and perfect dodges is also off the charts for some reason, every boss I've beaten so far was a fist-pumping victory, no matter if it's the first or twenty-first try.The art direction I saw in the trailer is what drew me in and thankfully I find the gameplay to be just as enjoyable."
Positive,After completing the game I can say it's one of the best games that I ever played
Positive,I luv monke
Positive,"This game is so pretty it reminds me of times my late grandfather who used to bring me to China for trips when I was younger. My granpa recently passed this year & this game really helps me mourn, as he used to read the original Sun Wu Kong when I was younger before bed.  I am not one person who plays souls like games & find some of the bosses hard but I learned to overcome them & have fun. This game is a real love letter to many who have read / watch journey to the west growing upWould recommend greatly"
Positive,"this game is BANANAS! I mean absolute APE shit! I really wasnt MONKEYING around when fighting! I kept SWINGING my weapon like crazy! Kept really GIBBON myself into trouble! I was ready to go GORILLA on these fools! I felt like a CHIMPIan when I won! Felt like a real BADBOON to some characters! I really was the GIGANTOPITHECUS of the world! treated like I was a TERRIBLE APE, but all I was a GOLDEN MONKEY! sometimes u gotta HOWLER (monkey) ur way outta things!"
Positive,Excellent game that takes features from Souls like games while at the same time doing its own thing. Feels a bit nostalgic to how action adventure games used to be in the past. This year looking great with great games without the Woke nonsenseApes together strong!
Positive,"From the moment I stepped into the beautifully crafted world, I was completely blown away. The level of detail in the environments, character designs, and animations is simply breathtaking. Every frame feels like a piece of art, making it one of the most visually stunning games I’ve ever played.The combat Is fluid, challenging, and incredibly satisfying. The variety of abilities and the depth of the combat system provide a rich experience that keeps you engaged and constantly adapting to new challenges. Each boss fight is epic, requiring skill to overcome. The game does an amazing job of balancing difficulty, ensuring that victories feel earned and rewarding.In short, It sets a new standard for the action RPG genre and is, without a doubt, one of the best games I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. If you’re a fan of the genre or just love well-crafted games, this is a must-play."
Positive,"Sometimes a game slaps you so hard you wake up 10 hours later in a ditch filled with blood and piss, monkeys flanking you on either side, giant tigers with big swords, and an insatiable desire for pig meat. Doesn't matter how you got there; blame yourself or God. Point is, you gotta fight to get out. I dunno how many bosses man. 70-100. Huge areas with no map so you end up humping trees for hours looking for a way out. Get yourself sucked into a scroll like its Mario 64 and you got a gold star to get. You're going to lose track of who you are and where you're going, and that's fine. It's not your fault you're here. Maybe this won't make sense to you. That's okay cuz I promise this game won't make any sense to you. Everyone yapping on, doing poems and what-have-you. Sometimes the game randomly plays a cartoon and I promise they will give you PTSD. You're not going to learn Chinese playing this game, either, so you can forget that dream right now buster!This is a good game."
Positive,No woke in sight. A gift from the East. GOTY contender and hopefully the winner.
Positive,"smooth combat, great graphics, unique boss design and fights"
Positive,"When this game is released, Eastern go to play this game and Western go to watch ""Journey to the West"". 11/9 Rating."
Positive,I got monkeypox from this game
Positive,"8.5/5 in China Extra points for the symbolic references to the  Chinese classic literature. That is external from the video game itself but it's effects rings in the context of Chinese society.Rest of the World: 8.5/10While the game is visually impressive, it falls short in a few key areas. The boss designs lacks creativity. The game world feels static, as if frozen in time, missing the dynamic atmosphere that could bring it to life. Additionally, there's a noticeable disconnect between the in-game characters and the environments they inhabit, which weakens the overall immersion."
Positive,"8.5/10   Wukong's significance to China: At first, he saved China's novels, comics, and then Chinese culture and movies. Now, he is going to save Chinese games again. Yeah, you heard right, he is the God of War of the Chinese people"
Positive,"I love the lore and mythology of this game.  The controls are responsive, i do find myself doing an extra hit or an extra roll i didn't mean too.  But that is me an something i need to fix myself.  The visuals are beautiful and the voice acting so far is spot on."
Positive,PACE APPROVED 👍🏿
Positive,"Reject humanity, embrace Monke."
Positive,+100000000 aura for playing this game!
Positive,"Masterpiece.Went for the True Ending and it was Absolute Cinema, not just the ending itself, but also the path to get there. Beautiful in every single way, from the way they implemented the adaption of Journey to the West, to the in-game graphics, cutscenes and inter-chapter animations."
Positive,Absolutely Amazing!!!!Gorgeous Graphics and such smooth combat system. Truly impressive.10/10. Game Of The Year for sure. A huge slap in the face of all the woke ass western gaming journalists and media outlets who tried to cancel such an amazing game with their shitty propaganda. Really looking forward to more AAA titles from Game Science!
Positive,"This game is dope. What a breath of fresh air. I am in love with the looks, sound, story and OMG the combat. The combat alone is worth its price. This is what I wish Elden Ring controls felt like. As for performance, not having issues at all. Settings in game at cinematic. Running 4k at 60 FPS with vsync on since I am on a big tv with a few very minute dips. I turned motion blur off also and no ray tracing ON(always turn that off). GPU is 7900 XT and cpu Ryzen 7 5800x. No crashes, stutters or flickers of what digital Foundry reported. If you are worried about performance their benchmark tool is free to download to test your specs. Also you do get a 2 hour refund window on steam. This is game of the year folks no matter what vocal minority you hear from their echo chamber. This is going to be Steams GOTY in 2024. If Video game awards doesnt nominate it then you know to boycott those scrubs."
Positive,"combat design: 10/10 innovative combination of action/souls games of the past 2 decades high apm gameplay but mostly optimized for 1v1s. Very accessible game with plenty of options early on to cater to a wide audience while being a souls-like.audio-visual art: 10/10 hollywood+animegraphics: 9/10 great UE 5 tech but marred by optimization issues, frame gen and resolution scaling options are not implemented smoothly (and looks bad) especially on early launch.technical: long loading times, cannot rebind KB+M keys (!), crashes at early launch, stutters when loading new animations and models and on several cutscenes, cutscene audio desyncs.level design: 7/10 even earlier chapters feel like MMO maps dotted with mobs. Plenty of filler spaces that could have been cut or filled with more secrets/loot. Attempted grand-scale map design failed by immersion-breaking invisible walls and very obvious streamlined roads.8.5/10 overall can be 10/10 if chapters 5 and 6 were to be reworked, and other technical issues ironed out."
Positive,You will never be Chinese 你永远成不了中国人 You will never find pride in your working life for China 你永远不会为自己在中国的工作生活感到自豪 Mighty country loves all her people and brings many glory 强大的国家爱她的所有人民并带来许多荣耀 You will never be Sun Wukong 你永远成不了孙悟空 You will never have godly powers that allow you to overcome your most greatest tribulations 你永远不会有神圣的力量让你克服最大的磨难 You will always be a western 你永远是西方人
Positive,"Long story short if you action/ souls like gameplay you'll like this , just buy it"
Positive,china dark souls
Positive,I feel more represented by a chinese monkey than in most modern western games.
Positive,"it's essentially a kid friendly souls lite. Estus, Bonfire, revive on death and story based on immortality and Gods. Combat is easy for a verteran soulsborne fan and the game is very boss rush. So if you like chinese mythology. boss rush and souls like combat not a bad choice."
Positive,"A week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illness and the doctors have given me a year at best. I'm so glad I was able to play this masterpiece before I go. I don't know how many people will see this; but I recommend to you to buy this game if you do see it. Gameplay, atmosphere, graphics. everything is masterfully crafted. If you read it, thank you and good bye."
Positive,"If like myself, you found the typical Dark Souls games to be slightly too difficult to bother with, then this game will be just right offering a challenge without demanding hours of practice.The enemy design is fantastically unique, the visuals are amazing, and the combat is very fun."
Positive,"Pros:1. Game is beautiful2. Cartoons after each chapter are amazing3. A lot of different bosses and enemies4. Reminds me God of War with a sprinkle of Dark SoulsCons1. Invisible walls are really annoying2. Combat feels a bit dull3. Bosses just sponges for damage4. Some bosses have terrible hit boxes5. Game mostly linear but at the end of the game they added an open area, when I already wanted to finish the game6. Don't see much potential for replayability"

Positive,Solid 8/10 when the frames and everything holds up -1 for no map and -1 for poor hit detection and minor issues but honestly nice pickup for the holidays when its on sale. Also if you like chinese mytholgy and Wukong you shouldn't even have to read this buy the game.
Positive,"Reject Humanity, Return to Monke"
Positive,Game was absolutely amazing 10/10 only flaw was that there wasn't more of it
Positive,I'm one of those that rarely play souls-likes and this is one of the best game I've ever played. Easily GOTY of 2024.

Positive,"I was so blown away from the intro that it was sensory overload for me! Even in the first hour of playing I was enjoying the fluid gameplay as I was fighting creatures of Chinese mythology and took in the beautiful landscapes as I made my way through. The lighting, the textures, and water effects were awesome and apparently my Alienware R11 with NVIDIA GeForce RTX2080 Super and 32G Ram was up to the task. I've yet to play through the whole thing but I must say I've been blown away with everything I've seen so far! For now I'm totally recommending it!"
Positive,"Wow what a game.  I started with downloading the benchmark to make sure everything would work well. Every game developer needs to do this!i9 4900 ks , 4070 super - everything runs full dlss, max settings some small stutter at points but overall very playable at 4k."
Positive,"[[I am going to change my review after doing some testing and research. For transparency I will leave it as several of the points are valid issues a new person may want to prepare for.To address the loading and other issues, I have to admit I am not a PC guy. I don't have a 'potato' but I also was not fooled into getting the most expensive graphics cards on the market and looking like a fool yelling into the review section (perks of having an IT friend build my stuff, haha). If ANYONE is having the issues I described with Loading and/or stuttering please insure you are installed onto an SSD. I had the game on a secondary drive that was not an SSD and when I reinstalled it as a test on my actual SSD after cleaning it up my load time was only about 2-3 minutes to get into the game and no lagging or stuttering. This game was made for an SSD as most these days are and it might be a solid solution if you have not tried that.]]ORIGINAL REVIEWI want to love this game but I had to uninstall it. Its not worth the stress it caused me. Its gorgeous and well within the theme of the setting but the game play is un-playable for me. The issues are all at launch, if the game is refined at a late date, this may change.1) The loading is bad. Like, 10 minutes to get into the game bad. 2) Memory issues cause the game to lag periodically. Its usually only when first loaded, but when you have to sit in 10 minutes worth of loading just to launch the game, its painful to have to wait for the INGAME processing to finish.3) Combat is quite impossible for me. Every boss has floats in their attacks, making the visually obvious moments to dodge too soon. Add to this the fact that bosses with have attack patterns that lead several attacks in a row, none of which are on a rhythm and it is quite hard to get a good handle on when to dodge. And that's not counting any of the quick attacks that you just have to know is coming or the bosses with phases that leave them mostly invisible while attacking. 4) Damage calculations seem a bit too extreme. You will do chip damage and need to land many combos to see a boss' health bar drop but they will catch you and backhand you doing a poor dodge and you will lose almost all of your health. This is with best gear at the time and as much HP as I was able to get. The solution is 'eat the damage mitigation pill' but that's not really a solution its a crutch. Honestly, I felt that gear didnt really do anything for me, as each time I got an upgrade it was still slightly behind the current content and didn't feel like it had an impact.5) Spells are set up as your go-to solution for a lot of issues but there is little to no mana regen apart from resting at a shrine and resetting mobs. This tended to leave me empty of mana when enter a boss room for the first time and then caused extra work to get to the boss rooms on subsequent attempts with mana intact. I really love the games system and wanted to enjoy it. I pre-ordered and pre-installed it then counted down the hours to release. But after playing for 10 hours I have learned that this game is sadly not for me. If these are not issues for you, please give it a try. But if you are like me and have issues with these dodge-heavy games that keep putting floats and pauses in their boss attacks just to make it hard to anticipate attacks, maybe look else where."
Positive,"Amazing, game. About 50 hours in. Completed main story and have all but 1 king and 1 chief remaining. Highly recommended! GOTY!"

Positive,"When a developer ONLY focus is making a good game with no PC BS strings attached , you will get a great game like this"
Positive,10 out of 10 for me not to hard not to easy just good
Positive,"BUG方面： 一、红孩儿Boss战二阶段，在所有浮空分身都砸下来后，红孩儿真身有几率会卡在半空不下来，导致战斗无法继续。二、有时候进入装备和物品栏界面会只出现空白背景，而无法正常显示现有的装备、物品。三、下筋斗云时，有一定概率不显示UI。四、和NPC石中人对话时，会拉到附近远程怪的仇恨，导致对话过程中一直被投射。 游戏设计方面： 一、 空气墙过多且很生硬。有些地方明明做出了“通路”，但实际不可通过。如果以树干或者石块堵路的柔性方式来暗示玩家此路不通，会让游戏体验更具沉浸性。二、 部分大体积Boss锁定点不合理，经常让玩家误判方向和距离，导致空大。 游戏设计方面： 一、 装备系统恰到好处，即不过度简单，也不过度复杂。每个装备的属性在对付特别Boss或者使用特别打法时都有妙用，并非一般游戏那样随着级别升高或者获取新装备后，旧的装备就会被丢弃或者雪藏。二、 技能在土地庙（传送点）处可以随时重置，能无代价更换新的打法，拓展游戏的可玩性，这点在多周目下尤其明显。三、 妖怪种类多种多样，而且每一类都有自己独特的外观和招式，并非简单的换皮怪。使得玩家在每一回跑图清怪都能有不同体验。 思想内涵方面： 一、 叙事。采用“罗生门”式碎片化叙事，这点如果读完在游戏内的影神图（角色背景故事集）会有更深的体会。二、 结局。个人认为无论“好”结局还是“坏”，一定程度上都超脱了一般游戏的爽文式结局，甚至具有一些哲理的开放性。这也是很多之前速通玩家对结局颇有怨怼的地方。作为预购玩家，原本是抱着成与不成都支持一下国产第一款大作的态度。但目前游戏的成功可以说给了我一个大大的惊喜。虽然有bug，有团队经验不足导致地包括但不限于上述设计缺点，但瑕不掩瑜；作为一家新成立的小公司，游戏科学能做到如此地步，我觉得无法对这些瑕疵作过度苛刻的批评了。而在游戏发售后短时间内舆论场上风暴，本身也从话题度上证明了该游戏的成功。我无意介入这一阵阵风暴，作为一名玩家，我只想好好地待在平静的台风眼里，默默地玩游戏，时不时叹一声：“厉害！好玩！”这便够了。 Bugs: I. In the second phase of the battle of Honghaier (Red Boy, one of Yaoguai kings), after all of clones crashing down, Honghaier may get stuck in the air and can’t land successfully. It directly results the battle being discontinued. There is no way to figure out except for reloading the battle.II. In some situations, equipment and item can’t be displayed normally, equipment and item tabs only show blank background.III. In some situations, UI may disappear after player dismounting Jindouyun (flying nimbus) .IV. One of nearby ranged monster always attacks you if interact with the NPC Shizhongren (Man-in-Stone, one of Characters) Game design: I. Invisible walls are overnumerous and unnatural. Some fake trails were just built for gorgeous background and not available for passing through. Please replace those ridiculous fake trails with rocks, trunks, fences or any environment matching things. These invisible walls is ruining our gameplay experience.II. Locking point of some bosses with huge body is illogical. It may mislead player and result ability or spells releasing on wrong position. Game design: I. Equipment system is on the perfection point, neither too simple and boring, nor too complicated and difficult. In common games, equipment item is more like ‘disposable item’, those equipment which gather previously will be destroy or just be stored on inventory. In contrast to that, each equipment with its special usage for the battle of special boss in this games. Meanwhile, different equipment/item combination will bring you different combat experience.II. Spark (Ability point) can be reset anytime in the nearest Tudimiao (Land Keeper’ shrine) at none of expense. It encourages players trying more methods to play this game, massively extends the gameplay, especially in second, third or even higher round.III. Category of yaoguai (monster) is varied. Every type of yaoguai with different model and action which can be easily distinguished from one to the other one. Designer didn’t put same mode on most of monster then paint them with different colour (nobody implies God of War hereby, doesn’t it?). It makes players always get fresh experience when they enter next chapter. Story I. The narration and text of this game belong to ‘rashomon-like’ style. Producers won’t tell players whole story directly. You need to gather NPC’s background information and carefully read them in Yingshentu (Portraits in journal tab) to find final truth behind endless lies, just like a detective chasing clues .II. About disputed ending, I personally consider whatever ‘good’ or ‘bad’ ending it is, the story won’t tell you what is it, it just enlightens you to think about what it should be. Philosophical karma, funny or serious? Can not judge it by a simple word.As a pre-purchase player, I have no idea of how good or bad for the first triple A video game which is base on Chinese classic folklore and ancient culture. I just throw money into slots and wait for uncertain result. Luckily, Game Science does an extreme nice job, bring me a huge surprise! Even with bugs and cons which I partly listed as above. Consider that how small their team size is, and moreover, Black myth: Wukong is their first triple A game, it’s unfair to blame them from head till toe. Don’t be a picky player all the time, be tolerant of these diligent game producers. After this game released, I noticed that some suspicious paparazzi posted their strange opinions everywhere. I think a pure game player should avoid those storms, stay away from publicity, grab a keyboard or controller then hit start button: Hell, it’s a game time!"
Positive,REJECT MODERNITY RETURN TO MONKE
Positive,the amount of aura they gave wukong is insane~
Positive,Good game. The bosses are fun the combat feels good. The only downside it that attacking after dodging can feel a bit clunky. Its not for me though im just not a big fan of soul likes. But if your are into that then this is a great choice.
Positive,"Honestly the game is amazing and a must play for any action/ rpg fan. The bosses are great and have some challenge to them. The graphics are amazing and the world is beautiful. You can respec at any time to experiment with different builds, which is a huge plus. Cant recommend this game enough. It could use some optimization but other than that, I have nothing negative to say."
Positive,"I finally found the reason for my game constantly crashing and frame splitting! I simply... moved it from my hard drive and into my SSD...It lowkey sounds dumb when you say it out loud, but I normally just download everything into one of my two 5TB Hard Drives and call it a day, never would've thought to simply move the download storage.11/10 Game so far, though. I might even just restart now that I can play it through fully."

Positive,No issues with the game 2 hours in. Best introduction to a game ever. Very explosive.
Positive,This game is incredible. The historical accuracy and dedication to the source material is insane. The graphics are truly next level and the character designs are very unique. The gameplay is fresh and feels great on keyboard (my preference). The difficulty is there but the game is quite forgiving with no consequences upon death (executor for some mob respawns). So far the story is quite compelling and I am having a lot of fun :)
Positive,"Up to yours, Tik Tok hacks acting as video game journalists.  The game. Serious review: The best game relased this year so far wich honestly means little, considering we got garbage like Suicide Squad, Skull and Bones and Flintlock. It looks and runs amazingly and the ""tutorial"" was just.....Damn, awe inspiring with a taste of of the amazing combat. A feast for the eyes and ears. What are you waiting for? Start doing the monkey right now and support devs who trampled all the miserable talentless freaks who want to ruin our dear hobby and the industry. Thanks, Game Science.Edit: After 4 hours and beating a fair amount of bosses i can update this review and say in good faith that Wukong is a masterpiece. Fluid combat encouraging perfect dodges that synergies perfectly with spells and transformations. Also of course enjoyable characters and memorable encounters thanks the amazing soundtrack and superb voice acting.The production value of Wukong is just......Stop reading and play it!Another edit: Completed my first playtrough, main history and every optional hidden boss of course including the NUT CRACKING 20 mins fourth phased real final boss. Wukong is a sublime and extremly rewarding game, also one of the most cinematic experiences gaming has to offer.....Stop reading and buy it."

Positive,Amazing graphics and game contents.
Positive,game is great. feels great. looks great. the lack of a map is my only complaint about it. what a breath of fresh air. finally a game that was made for gamers.
Positive,First Chapter itself is enough for me
Positive,"BMW is what happens when a developer has a vision, focus and the right priorities.  Ancient Myth, Modern Tech, Incredible game.  As you play, you can feel the passion of the team who made BMW.  Challenging, combining the best from modern-Souls and character action games of yesteryear, the gameplay is fun, and addictive.Stunning visuals, even in the first chapter, I had Several ""WHOA"" moments.  Linear, but with some reasonable secrets/rewards for those who like to explore.Not button mash dreck, but not unfair.Personally, I felt shades  of a few of my favorite platinum/DMC games, with what seems like a bit more challenge, or maybe it just seems that way because of the LIGHT souls like elements.BMW really feels like a breath of fresh air, giving the feeling that I am experiencing a piece of art/media that the creators cared about.  The environments are lush and detailed, enemies massive and have awesome designs, the music is a perfect fit for the world and it all come together to immerse the player almost magically.It won't be a cakewalk, but it's very, VERY much worth playing.  And if, like me, you have mid-level skills, this game will provide a TON of playtime, with many NON-PUNISHING  death.  And, when you finally do beat that challenging enemy, the sense of accomplishment will be REAL.Game Science wanted to give the player an unforgettable experience, without compromise.Technical note.I am playing with a: 10XXX intel cpu64gb DDR4NVME driveand...A...GTX1080tiSettings:1080P @60hzDetail settings ""High""So, no access to the current tier of graphics tech.BMW is STILL STUNNING, just GORGEOUS.I have heard about bugs, but haven't encountered any.... YET.I feel like the performance issues and bugs might be found primarily inside the more cutting edge graphics tech....  since I am not using them, with a reasonably capable card, it seems to run pretty nicely and look really pretty.I can't WAIT to get to know this world more. and hope that this is just the first in the series."

Positive,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. It's a true showing of the technological advancements and progress through cinematography/mistakes of past games/art displaying the future of games. This game goes harder than the movies at some point, which makes sense it's newer, but damn. I hope god of war takes notes. Also i'm looking up reviewers to blacklist the ones that gave this game anything less than 9 or 10/10, this game is an absolute masterpiece."
Positive,The crashes are disappointing.
Positive,china wins again
Positive,Game of the year
Positive,"Have to say that this game surprised me more than I expected. Stunning graphic and music designs. Challenging combats and a ton of unique bosses designs are simply amazing. Story telling is also a shiny part, especially if you know the familiar Chinese mythology - Journey to the West. For the downside that bothers me is the air wall and no mini map design... however, for me, Black Myth - Wukong is no longer a game but a masterpiece. It is a must-have if you like God of War, Elden Ring, Dark Souls."
Positive,"The game is great and worth getting even at full price but it isn't the 10/10 some people are making it out to be. It does some things great like the number of bosses and the variety in their attack styles but other things like the story and polish it falls short on. I played with the English voices and they sounded great, some of them have a British accent but it wasn't bad and I think the voices fit. The game has great surround sound and music. I have heard for the Chinese players there is music from a popular TV series from the 80s about the Journey to the West that a lot of them grew up on so that is a nice touch for them. I have a 7900XT and played at 4K 60FPS. The game does look great when you stop to take in the surroundings but the game forces you to use upscaling which is a negative to me. I don't have DLSS so I am not sure how it looks in this game but having tested the other 3 available upscalers (FSR, TSR, XESS) they all have some drawbacks and are not as good as native. Setting the upscaler to 100 does not seem to set it to native. In the Benchmark tool they released before the full game it showed even at 100 there was different results between the 3 upscalers and in the full game if you turn on motion blur to strong and spin around you can still see ghosting around his head so the upscaling is still on. I am also pretty sure this is not FSR 3.1 which has the new upscaler so I would like to see that added at some point. Turning on Frame Gen with both FSR and TSR causes trees in some locations to constantly flicker when moving. I was able to hide this by turning motion blur on but I normally do not play with motion blur so that is kind of annoying but to minimize the visual issues upscaling causes it is needed in this game. I eventually settled on leaving FSR to 50 with the Very High graphics preset to get a near constant 60FPS. Without the flickering from Frame Gen I only had to deal with the ghosting from upscaling but with motion blur set to weak I was able to hide it enough that It didn't bother me for the rest of the game. Outside of the upscaling issue the game looks amazing.There are some translation errors but they have been fixing them overtime. The story however is the biggest issue I had with the game. It takes place after the Journey to the West so before buying the game I watched a several videos on the Journey to the West to have a frame of reference in the game. But even with that the story is presented in a way that you will probably be confused if you have not actually read the novel. A lot of the details that elevate a story to being great will be missed so you will need to find an explanation from someone online who has read the novel to fully appreciate the story. The game is definitely made with the expectation you know the Journey to the West novel well. The game does try to add some back story on characters through journal entries you get from beating enemies but I would say the majority of them were just random tales or poetry that while interesting were not relevant to the main story. Some definitely did explain more about the major characters and the story but those were still not enough in my opinion. After you beat a chapter you unlock a mural of events relevant to that chapter. If you zoom in you will find the option to click on parts of it and a narrator will give some brief dialogue that does help but if you don't zoom it's easy to skip past it and never get the dialogue. The dialogue there is usually helpful but they are brief and leave you wanting more. With all the effort they put into the mostly irrelevant journal entries I think it would have been better to reduce the journal entries and instead have a small detailed recap of the parts of the Journey to the West that chapter is based on before or after a chapter. There are 6 chapters in total and after each chapter there is a cool animated video but they have little dialogue and the stories can seem out of place. Sometimes the story is in reference to the main story of the chapter you just finished so you understand what it's about but other times it's about a side story in the upcoming chapter so you have no idea what it was about. If you read the novel though you will recognize the character and have an idea of what is coming up. It's possible in the one where it references a side story for you to miss it in the chapter and then be even more confused about what the previous video was about since the character never appeared. In other cases the video references something that happened in the previous chapter but the characters are in another form so you have no idea who it is unless you read the novel and make the connection.It's a shame because there is a really good story here with great characters and acting but it feels like a lot of the time the characters aren't given enough time to have the impact they could have because the story is told with the expectation of you knowing the backstory already. Now all that said if you don't mind having to go read a bunch of forum posts or read the book the story in the game is actually pretty interesting and the secret/true ending hints at what the DLC should be about.I have seen some people say it's too hard and others it's too easy. I would say the difficulty is closer to God of War and  the Souls games are harder. The game does a great job of making it feel like an actual journey though. You start off weak and the game makes you learn the mechanics early on or you won't be able to beat the boss. As I gained new abilities the following chapters felt easier overall. I had the most deaths in Chapter 1 as I was learning but after that the number of tries I needed to beat a boss dropped significantly. In the later chapters they raise the difficulty again so it doesn't get too easy. NG+ is done really well too because the best items are only in NG+ so there is an actual reason to do NG+ and it's satisfying to destroy early bosses.There are over 100 bosses and most have different fighting styles and don't use unfair moves that insta kill. The combat is fun and can be mixed up as you get multiple spells, transformations, staff stances, and weapons. But there are some bugs and things the game does not explain. Sometimes your character just won't dodge or use an item in the middle of a fight. Sometimes this is due to status effects like being shocked but the game never explains the effects of these statuses so a lot of people think the combat is laggy. Other times it is due to input lag or a bug. I have tested it out with my controller and seen outside of fights there is sometimes noticeable input lag. I was able to fix it by restarting the game but if it starts in the middle of a fight you are stuck with it as changing the controller didn't help. Level design is mostly linear but I like it because it's more curated so you get a better experience. Even though it is linear there is still a lot to explore. I never had an issue with the invisible walls like some of these people claim. It never broke the atmosphere for me and 99% of the time I could tell where a wall was. The worst area for me was the open world chapter because it is mostly empty so I had to waste time exploring a boring area. There is a snow chapter that is semi open world and it was the second worst area because it was a pain to explore. That chapter is also the one most people have performance issues on due to size and snow. Outside of 1 area the environment is not an obstacle like in Souls games but the camera can mess you up sometimes. Even with those issues it's still a great game that I recommend and I can't wait for the DLC. 5=Average6=Decent7=Good8=Great9=Amazing10=Perfect"
Positive,"all 81 achievements obtained. Although my ancient PC could only do with Medium graphic settings, the game looks absolutely breathtaking to me. The whole journey is neither too long nor too stressful, reminds me of the pure joy when i encountered Sekiro. It is not without flaws, but devs have found a smart way to highlight their uniqueness and strengths without overestimating themselves, so the overall gaming experience stays pleasant."
Positive,"8/10 作为中国产第一款3A大作确实是可圈可点的  作为一个游戏优缺点也很明显优点：·图像点赞到爆 光追开启游戏视觉特效简直是享受·打斗可用的方法多样性，不同的装备和法宝组合可以玩出所谓“职业”的感觉·主线剧情展示方式新颖 中国画讲故事很好看缺点· (大硬伤) 剧情云里雾里且体量小 大篇幅被放在隐藏关卡且没有相关指引 缺少小地图·隐藏关卡虽然叫做隐*但是在游戏中十分重要，错过了很影响游戏体验，缺少指引·打斗方面太过于强调棍势和硬直条，几乎不存在机制怪,·高强度打斗时频繁闪退（4080S显卡 光追只拉到70%，随机闪退）As a Soul-like ARPG game Black Myth did really well. The game is not a perfect game and have strong point and weaknessStrength;·Amazing graphics and map design, flawless motion and visual effects·Great variety of combat techniques, can build into specialised classes using the combination of tools given, level progression feels good in the beginning·New way of story telling, combining art and story telling gives a great new narrativeWeakness:·(Biggest Weakness) Lack of clear lore, and story line is short, even then, many lore are placed in ""hidden areas""·Hidden areas are way too important to be ""hidden areas"", lack of clear directions·Difficulties of boss is only affected by Resistance bar and power attack, the 4 status alignment has very little effect.·Optimisation issues, as 4080S and only DLSS at 70%, experience quite a few forced quits."
Positive,"Fun, a good challenge, and different visuals which are great."
Positive,"Always been a huge Journey to the West lover and this game hits the spot. The combat is fun, lore is great, and the ost slaps."
Positive,You can draw dicks in the sand or snow.
Positive,Monke hit? Monke bonk
Positive,"Game is very fun. Love the variety, graphics and combat."
Positive,"Loving it so far. Playing on ROG Ally Z1 Extreme - game kept crashing after the intro fight, starting in compatibility mode seems to have fixed it. So far so good, definitely worth buying day 1."
Positive,"Good game, good characters, good atmosphere. Just be prepared to die a lot."
Positive,"Hi, I just want to say that I've got this game for free and I regret that I didn't pay for it. It deserves every euro/dollar/camel. Have a good year and stay away from Gibraltar, those monkeys are not as friendly as Wukong. byeeeeeeeeeeeee"
Positive,"I've played 3 hours and I can already say despite some performance issues, this game is amazing!  The atmosphere and the combat are just beautiful."
Positive,Good game. Me like
Positive,"""Black Myth: Wukong is an extraordinary gaming masterpiece that has exceeded my expectations in numerous aspects. The game's storyline is a brilliant reimagining of the classic Journey to the West. It weaves a captivating narrative filled with unexpected twists and turns, keeping me engaged and eager to uncover more. The depth and complexity of the plot not only pay homage to the original tale but also add refreshing elements that make it feel both familiar and novel. The graphics are simply stunning. The detailed environments, from lush forests to ancient temples, and the meticulously designed characters and monsters are a visual treat. The use of lighting and special effects creates an immersive world that draws you in completely. The combat system is highly addictive. The variety of skills and abilities at Wukong's disposal, along with the smooth animations and precise controls, make every battle a thrilling experience. The strategic element of adapting to different enemy types and exploiting their weaknesses keeps the gameplay challenging and rewarding. The sound design is another standout feature. The background music sets the mood perfectly, enhancing the atmosphere and intensifying the emotional impact of the game. The sound effects of weapons clashing and spells being cast add a layer of authenticity to the combat. Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a remarkable achievement that showcases the talent and dedication of the development team. It is a game that I would highly recommend to any gamer, and I am looking forward to seeing more from this franchise in the future."""
Positive,साल का खेल!!
Positive,11/10 GOTY MONKE!!! fk off to those woke journalists btw don't bring politics into gaming
Positive,modern audience? monke!Too easy! Monke want a harder DLC!
Positive,"Po cara, que saudade que deu de um jogo de aventura pique jogo antigo, um gowzinho, um game mais de boa, sendo assim, wukong vem forte e é MUITO BOM, vale muito!"
Positive,"And now for something completely different:-Monkey, Stick, Monkey hit with stick-Made by people who care about the quality of a product, not the color of their skin.-PC Port seems solid, even if the game is designed for a controller. Haven't had any crashes, and performance is solid, running on a 4070 Ti, with near max settings. DLSS does cause framegen to stutter in some rapidly changing scenes, but those are few and far between.-Not an easy game, but it's not one with a high skill ceiling. It's just fun to play for everyone.-It pretty.Who can imagine, a studio who doesn't bow down to the self-placed hall monitors of DEI Enforcement, is more popular, a better game, and actually enjoyable to play, unlike the ""Games made for a modern Audiences"". There is no agenda to insert, it's a game based on a fairy tail/fantasy.One thing to note, is despite it being fairly linear, the game FEELS large. Areas feel larger than they are, rather than being large for the sake of km^2 of gameworld. It is akin to a collection of arenas, with a few side areas... which is not bad. The game is fun, it plays well, and I actively had to tear myself away from playing it.... Last time I had that big of an impression with a game, was Factorio.Fuck DEI, Support people who love to make games because they want to make a game, not the Journalists/Activists who continue to try to profit from their own agenda of ruining games, or pushing sub-par products just to try and normalize politically motivated trash. Play the game yourself, and give an honest opinion. 2 Hours is more than enough of a window to get a good experience of what the game has to offer, and if you do not like it, then vote with your wallet... but steam charts don't lie.Companies need to realize, Game Journalists and Diversity Officers will ruin your game. A good product sells itself, no matter how negative the vocal minority of idiots yell about how it isn't to their liking. Wear the badge of being shamed by these people with pride. Game Science has. No one is obligated to give game journos anything. Everyone is obligated to watch game journos cope and seethe though."
Positive,"Edit After completion at bottomThis is honestly a really fantastic game. And I really had fun, until I didn't. I'm not normally a difficult game player like this, or any souls, elden ring, the surge, lies of p, etc etc. I initially bought the game cause of the cool designs, chinese literature and etc. It gets pretty hard at the end of chapter 2 and into chapter 3. If you like tough games, then i'd very much reccomend this. But if you are looking for something like God of War or the Jedi series, (with a difficulty choice) then I would go somewhere else. This could simply be a skill issue on my part but after sometime, games like these become a drag, I don't feel ""YEAH I DID IT"". I feel ""ugh, glad thats over"" and don't really feel accomplishment. All that said and ignoring my skill issue, Black Myth Wukong is a fantastic game. It has quite frustrating moments but with amazing graphics, gameplay, story and combat. Once again, if you are looking for an easy time, I'd look else where.After completion: After completing the game, despite some bosses being a pain, I was able to finish the game, get the true ending and have a good time. I had some bugs/glitches of certain things not appearing or getting locked out of things but it didn't affect my overall progression, it would just stop you from 100%. If you still want to play but can't beat things or get too frustrated and want a casual, easier time, don't be afraid to use some mods! It doesn't matter, despite what some may say, as long as you enjoy the game in your own way, so what!"
Positive,4070ti cant make it past shaders. Ill change review after they update it.Edit: GoTY Absolutely amazing boss rush with great story telling. I no longer feel shame in being called a monkey.
Positive,"Great visuals, great ost, great combat. Even on a shitty old desktop (1060) it still runs smooth on Med."
Positive,Frieza would hate this game
Positive,Best game this year so far
Positive,"A boss marathon is what you need, not that lame game Elden Ring."
Positive,so fucking good. hard for an old man like me and I had to buy my first controller for this game but damn it's amazing
Positive,"What an incredible journey, the fighting is good, the music is good,  and animation is good and anime after each chapter is great, overall the game is awesome. Definitely GOTY for me. If you like souls-like and God of War, this is a must play."
Positive,"One of the best action games I've played in a while, if you're worried because it's a soulslike I'll tell you now-- the closest comparison I could make to this game is that its a linear action rpg like god of war (2016) with combat that's closer to Bayonetta. With that out of the way, I'll just say one of the only downsides I could point out is the reliance on your knowledge of the source material. You can play the game without it, but you're really gonna be missing out on a lot of the story and lore if you dont know it. Don't worry though! You don't have to read/watch all of it to get the game, in fact, each chapter of the game corresponds to just a couple chapters from the book which i'll put down here along with the episodes from the 1986 TV Show. Read/watch these chapters before the corresponding chapter of the game and you'll have a much better time! ESSENTIAL MONKEY BACKGROUND: Chap 1-7 OR Episode 1-3Before Chapter 1 (of Black Myth): Chap 16 & 17 OR Episode 6Before Chapter 2: Chap 20 & 21 OR Episodes 8ANYTIME BEFORE CHAPTER 3: Chap 18 & 19 OR Episode 7Before Chapter 3: Chap 65 & 66 OR Episode 19Before Chapter 4: Chap 72 & 73 OR Episode 21Before Chapter 5: Chap 40-42 and Chap 59-61 OR Episodes 14 & 17Both the book and the TV Show can be found free online as a pdf and on Youtube, so check them out! The game is well worth the trouble. P.S. PLAY WITH CHINESE VOICES!!! The voice acting is FAR better"
Positive,"What can i say, as a Chinese gamer, this game is absolutely amazing"
Positive,"I am hooked, first ever soul-like game. Although I am tilted because of dying too many time at the first iron golem mini boss, but that helps me pick up the game mechanic eventually."
Positive,WUKONGA FOREVER \/\/
Positive,"Well, game just crash at opening boss. I have Intel® Core™ i5-12400F-processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060."
Positive,"edited review: I gave the game another chance because IGN and crybaby reviewers hate the game and the developer, 10/10 game, runs flawlessly now. The settings that were on by default must have been too much for my system, it had frame generation on, all cinematic quality settings, and uncapped framerate. The only change I made was cinematic downgraded to high, game runs and looks great. Plot is good, cutscenes are great, combat is good. Not a souls game, but it's a good action game.original review: ""crashed my pc so bad I had to reinstall drivers to get anything other than 1000x700 on a single monitor, game was running fine up until then. rx6950xt + ryzen 5900x + 32gb shouldn't have any issues running this game"""
Positive,Headless Guitar Man!!!!
Positive,"The game is amazing, beautiful graphics, the story is very well told, the devs clearly put a lot of work into making it the best experience and it shows.And you get the full experience. No microtransactions, no paid DLC, no predatory monetisation, no paid cosmetics.Highly recommended, likely my game of the year."
Positive,"2 million mokeys together, monkeys strong!It amazes me that the game looks exactly the same as when it was originally revealed a few years ago, the visual quality is absurdly good. Specially in the prologue, you can tell these devs are cooking with magic, as I for one know almost nothing about the tale the game is based on, and still the whole scene made me feel like, ok let's fucking do this! How the devs went from making mobile games to this work of art is beyond me.I am also happy that the game is not a 1 to 1 copy of the soulsborne mechanics, at least at this point in time I am enjoying the fast action mechanics more, could be Elden Ring's fatigue but all in all I like that the game is its own thing.I do have some stutters here and there but nothing game breaking, it seems to me that it happens when loading areas, I have a pretty basic SSD so it would make sense to me that it is having trouble loading big textures as it is not too fast. Then again we all knew Unreal 5 was going to be a heavy hitter, specially on lower PC specs, it is what it is. In the end I am still getting anywhere from 80 to 100 fps at 1440p maxed out, which I am happy with seeing that this game looks incredible.So far I am not too concerned about not having a map, the level design is good and I am not expecting maze type levels so I can do without a map, old school like.And the bosses, damn the bosses are superb, the game could be a big boss rush mode and I wouldn't enjoy it less than I am enjoying it now, as I feel like the bosses are the starts besides teh monkey King!Overall I am enjoying the game so much, the story is just what it needs, point me to the boss I need to battle and I am on it, nothing more, nothing less."
Positive,"When you have beaten game after game, boss after boss, very little is going to surprise you or provide a challange.But I think that games like Black Myth: Wukong are exactly what is needed to shake it up a bit and bring something new and exciting.The story is amazing and can be compared to God of War, there are lots of new gameplay elements, good enemy variety and at times phenomenal bosses. Levels are linear, but have a lot of hidden loot and are interesting to explore. Questlines are easy to follow and sometimes lead to entire secret areas with their own bosses and are adding onto the main story. The true ending boss sequence is great, the final boss will plague your shorts with his swagger for a long time after beating the game...My only gripe with the game is the lack of optimization, or foresight when it comes to the game's graphics.The game loads the gpu like crazy when playing and the cpu when compiling shaders and loading new areas. There are tons of posts from people who can't get through the starting(admittedly breathtaking) sequence, for fear of their gpu burning up, or their pc turning off to prevent damage. One unlucky guy even needed to reinstall windows after launching the game.The developers need to look into performance issues first and foremost, since to fix them the player would need to crank the graphics down quite a bit, and with low supersampling the game starts to look real bad.You cannot turn off supersampling and frame generation is basically required to not overload your GPU. Nobody is playing 4k native resolution, not even the 4090s.We have already had amazing games with stunning visual effects before, that did not require a lot of resources to run stable and chill, take Ghost of Tsushima for example. Sure, Wukong is pushing the boundaries with it's graphics, but what use are they if the players can't even run it?Overall though, what Game Science were able to achieve here, while not selling out to publishers or signing exclusivity deals, is nothing short of a miracle. The graphical challanges are but a spoon of tar in a barrel of honey that is this game. They are reportedly going to be releasing DLCs for this game and I am excited to see what they are going to cook up next!"
Positive,Journey to the game of the year
Positive,GOTY.Stunning graphics. Fun fighting. Great story with deep underlying Buddhism philosophy. Strongly recommend reading the original novel Journey to the West before playing this game.
Positive,第一次写review也把这个第一次留给了这个国产第一个3A除了我有点路痴外其他各方面都可以说无可挑剔了相信未来的优化会让这个游戏更上一层楼我想说的是 游科牛掰谢谢你让我这个从小喜欢大圣的人在有生之年里 能过九九八十一难做自己的大圣！
Positive,"I like playing souls-like games, but I have a hard time getting invested fully into each of the ones I've tried. Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, Code Vein, Sekiro, Salt & Sanctuary, Lies of P, (Tunic, but not really), just to name a few. With such little investment into the games, I end up not finding any motivation to finish them, explore the worlds and keep up patience with the boss fights.I was worried I'd feel the same with Black Myth: Wukong. I was wrong.It helped that I was already a fan of mythology, Chinese and Japanese mythology especially, and I always wanted to learn more about the lore of the mischievous Sun Wukong and the story of Journey To The West, yet I couldn't get behind the comedic and rather goofy style of the movies. This is purely personal taste, and I doubt there's anything wrong with those adaptations of the story, but for me, this game nails everything that I'd hope to experience. The darkness and grittiness of the world, coupled with the beauty and magic of the creatures that dwell within, make for a wonderful work of art that really brings these elements to life, and fully captivates me by visuals alone.It's not just the graphics that are the best I've seen in literally years (Besides Baldur's Gate 3). The music is wonderful to listen to, from ambient tracks of the overworld to the heart-pounding percussion of boss themes, to traditional monk chants and folk singing. The storytelling is easy to understand, and holds an essence of wonder and fantasy that one would oft find in mythology stories. The voice work of the creatures are entertaining to listen to, and each voice I've heard so far have a brilliant talent in bringing the characters to life, and this is for the English dubs!The game itself is lovingly crafted, and you can tell by the quality of the game, as it's an absolute blessing to play this without the disappointment of finding bugs, performance issues, system crashes and so on. Alongside this, it's also great to see a completely offline, single player experience, with the absence of micro-transactions, live service additions like cash shops and battle / season passes etc, that plague the gaming market this day and age.The one issue I have with the game is the movement. I noticed input lag with both my controller and my keyboard, and it felt pretty bad to try to attack and dodge while being delayed by half a second per action. However, there is a work-around, which is with turning off frame generation in the game's graphic settings. That seemed to remove input lag entirely.Other than this so far, the combat is fun and refreshing, with many skills helping you feel stronger and more powerful than before. Plus, the skill points you put into the skill trees can be taken out and swapped at any time, which makes for a fluid, adaptive response to bosses if one style just isn't working out.I bought the deluxe edition of this game, and let me tell you, it's worth every penny. Absolutely must have in your library!"
Positive,I love monke
Positive,yes it fun and nice game 6 stars
Positive,9/10 game. If i was Chinese id be going nuts over this game. Cinema the entire way through. Makes me want to read the story about Wukong.
Positive,"Epic game all the way through! I would recommend this to anyone who likes the new God of War games for sure. The gameplay is pretty close to that. There are TONS of boss fights. You might've heard this referred to as a boss rushy game, and it is. You spend at most 10 min between bosses. All the bosses are really cool and unique. Difficulty ranges from laughably easy to gotta order another controller. Progression is really nice. You get noticeably stronger as you level up and get new gear sets/weapons. Even though you only use staves, specializing in stances and gear set bonuses allow you to play different ways. It's not a HUGE variety, but I found myself switching specs on a few fights I got stuck on and the outcome was significant. I found that dialogue was kind of lacking. I think it's just a translation thing, but the point comes across well enough with the context of the action. And I've just gotta give the game credit for launching COMPLETE! I can't remember the last time a game of this quality launched feature complete and not trying to run my pockets like Deebo from Friday. Overall, I would give this a 9/10. The only thing I would actually knock it for is the dialogue. I also played all the way through without a single crash. I had a few frame stutters, but they were few and far between and didn't interrupt any fights. The game is demanding though, so definitely check to make sure you can run it."
Positive,Game of the century!
Positive,I'm addicted. (: help...
Positive,"A spectacular debut. Black Myth: Wukong has the bones of a seventh-gen hack and slash with all the glitz and glamour of a ninth-gen powerhouse, and I mean that in the most sincerely complimentary way. Removed from many industry trains of massive open worlds without anything to do, endless gear grinds for minute differences, and even the aggrandizing monetization that has become so entwined with modern AAA releases, Wukong stands as an almost nostalgic throwback when games were happy to exchange fun as a one-time, simple transaction. There are things here and there I don't enjoy. An abundance of invisible walls runs contrary to the deftness of mobility your player character has, enough that, when running around particularly layered segments of the game, it gets frustrating when you can't sequence skip even though you very clearly could if it wasn't for painfully artificial restraints. The narrative, too, while something I really enjoyed, is something I cannot imagine is easily followed if you aren't at least familiar with  Journey to the West . If you don't especially care for narratives in your games- especially games that are more oriented towards action and spectacle- I don't think this would be an especially pressing negative for you; however, if you are among that number, and haven't taken a college course in World Literature, and this game looks especially appealing to you, I'd encourage you to at least skim through the novel. Personally speaking, I don't enjoy Wukong to the point of its current 'Overwhelmingly Positive' mark on Steam, but I was moved to write this- strongly positive- review because of the rampant misinformation concerning the game, and because of the recently released coverage of Star Wars Outlaws, another AAA release competing for a premier spot in August. It is disgusting to me that a company as big as Ubisoft, with all their resources and with a brand as once beloved as Star Wars, cannot churn out something even a third as fun or as heartfelt as Wukong. I want more games like this in the AAA space, and in gaming in general. It's a beautiful title, and one that never failed to thrill throughout. A very, very strong recommend from me."

Positive,"I have sworn off souls-ish games but this one is okay I guess. Controls fluidly and good environment graphics. I just kind of suck at any souls-ish games and if there's a difficulty adjustment well I didn't find it. Oh well, I'll just try to learn enemy attack patterns I guess."
Positive,Nothing the game did but I suck at gaming so me personally I don't like it. It's fun until that Wandering Wight claps me 8 million times.
Positive,"Not as hard as Eldin Ring and a fair bit more on rails, but still quite a bit of fun."
Positive,Great graphic and movement
Positive,Amazing game!Saw the first trailer four years ago and have been waiting ever since !It sure does not disappoint!Have not ran into any bugs playing at a smooth 120fps at 1080p very high settings4070 super Can't wait for what comes next from GAME SCIENCE!Support this game !
Positive,"A guaranteed GOTY at this point. Truly a masterpiece of a game. It has its flaws, but for a game that came out in 2024, it runs decently, plays well, and provides a decent amount of challenge while not entirely holding the player's hand. As an ethnically Chinese person, I think that this game has stepped leaps and bounds in terms of showing the world what China is able to create, while sharing Chinese culture to Westerners at the same time. For those wondering if this game is worth the price, it 100% is, but there are definitely some pros and cons that I think are necessary to address. - Pros -Runs decently well (if you hardware isn't incredibly out of date. I played on an RTX 3070 laptop GPU) Amazing storyA TON of secrets, most you definitely will miss unless you watch YouTubeFun fighting mechanicsHigh amount of customization for builds A lot of weapons and armor sets Beautiful graphics- Cons - Some bosses aren't too well designed (in terms of hitboxes and attack patterns, making the battles unnecessarily hard) Many secret areas/bosses can't be returned to if you missed them Frame rates are choppy at certain locations, especially water-abundant areas The time exploring between bosses feels mostly shallow (there isn't much to do) Overall, despite the cons, I think this  game does deserve GOTY when the time comes. I really look forward to seeing more Chinese representation in the gaming industry, as the Chinese have not usually been in the spotlight when it comes to large AAA titles. Who knows where Game Science and Chinese game developers will go from here; but I can only see a bright future for all of them."
Positive,"One of the most beautiful and exciting action RPGs I have played. This game is just pure Art, regarding scenery and gameplay mechanics. Depending on the options, it's less variable than SoulsGames, but this game also provides a lot of possibilities for different playstyles and builds. The storytelling and the Art are just perfect. Some minor details, like the meditation spots and gorgeous cutscenes, add variety and relaxation to the gameplay, which I have not seen in any other game. The gameplay is one of the smoothest, if not the best, games I have ever experienced. Also, the cut scene or special fights look stunning, and in some scenarios, it does not feel like a game anymore but more like a cinematic illustration. This game is a title that definitely deserves a AAA rating, compared to other publishers and developers who solely live from their reputation. This game shows what should be the standard in the Industry for a 50+ Euro game. Also, the possibility of exploring the more linear world and meeting interesting characters and their side quests adds more depth to the game. Even though it's not an open-world game by definition, there are still a lot of places you need to discover actively, and if you follow the ""main"" path, you will simply miss a considerable chunk of the story. No microtransactions or any other bullshit, just a complete game that gets more and more interesting and does not feel repetitive at all. Everybody who likes smooth action RPGs with beautiful scenery and a smooth combat system won't be disappointed. You can easily invest 100+ Hours into this game without getting bored so that you will get your money's worth. All Black Myth Wukong is one of the best games I have ever played, and I absolutely recommend it."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a great action, soulslike game with some of the most epic boss fights you can imagine! Along with the previously mentioned, it is jam-packed with content and has amazing scenery with some decent gameplay to boot. I also have to praise this game for being so generous with skill point respecs. Definitely worth its asking price!However, it does commit some game design no-no's (imo) and may be slightly overrated by some. Some of the flaws include: Areas with scarce shrines (bonfires), some shrines far away from bosses (long boss runbacks), heavily delayed inputs after some animations, the occasional camera issue, and being overly explorative without any real exploration guide mechanic.Good game!8/10"

Positive,"I could write a story about Sun Wukong and myth about him but you probably either already know or don't really care much so I'll save your time and point out the most important bits about this game.If you want a game that wasn't made by people of 3rd gender, wasn't censored by people with hair of rainbow colors and won't turn inside out from eating a small piece of meat - then give this game a try. It's like a fresh air that you breath after you get out of public toilet that hasn't been cleaned, like ever at all yet was constantly filled up by people who think they have more rights and can decide what's better for you. Yes, it's the game that hasn't been tainted by all those things that some companies love to include for the sake of ''diversity'' and ''inclusivity''. It's just the game about a monkey, the long journey and some myth about  it. Give it a try, it's really worth the money."
Positive,"54 hours in game, enjoyed every second, never gets boring"
Positive,Meet Monke.Become Monke.Live Monke.Monke!
Positive,"13 hours in and I want to really enjoy this game but it has a bunch of issues. Not only is it incredibly demanding of a game graphically, but I just feel like a lot of time could've gone into optimization. Before I even get into my issues with the game itself, let me rant about the random crashes I continually have in this game. I have an undervolted 14900K, 64GB of Ram, a 4080 and playing this game with frame gen, dlss on quality and graphics on the 'High' settings. This game just continually will crash. Sometimes after 2 minutes. Other times like the day of this review, after 8 hours of gameplay with some breaks where I shut down during.Just no error log. Compatibility mode seems to be the most stable. Did I mention that up until today, anytime it would crash I would get a disk write error in steam on a brand new 990 Pro 2TB (which is in good health 100% with less than 100 write cycles on it in CrystalDisk)? I would have to hard shut down and restart for my Windows to recognize my G:\ drive. Bios finds it fine. Even tested it in another PC and it worked just fine. This game is the only game to do that. Luckily it seems to have stopped after clearing steam download cache and re-installing the game.Now lets get to gameplay. Real fucking fun but let me be clear: ITS NOT SOULS LIKE. At least not in the ways you'd think. Let me explainThere's always permanent armor buffs with the next set generally always being stronger and giving more defense than the last. These sets have armor set bonuses based on how many equipped that can offer buffs against previous optional-bosses if you run into some. Armor itself is always inherently going to want you to play with the strongest instead of mix and matching. Sure, you can, but there's no rhyme or reason to it. The defensive bonuses will just always give you greater damage reduction, contrary to how armor operates in souls games. Next are skills, they are always the same branches across a few tiers with each skill potentially having 1, 2, or 5 upgrade levels to them. These always unlock new skills and passives to help make your character stronger.You have no stats, no builds. From what I can tell things level to level 60. From there I'm not sure if you can get every skill but it looks like it's built to have tons of skills.Bosses, enemies respawning at checkpoints called shrines you can buy and craft from are common in this game, as is no map. Similar to souls and sekiro, however this game is purely an action game. It's more forgiving in it's attacks and faster paced with a reliance on button combo timing and delayed dodging.Staffs are the only weapon type. you have branching upgrades that offer some minor stat buffs and potential status effects. Similar to trees of a Monster Hunter Weapon. I believe you can have multiple staffs but I've only found 1.- Invisible Walls are fucking everywhere- Severe input lag on KMB and controller for the healing gourd and using an item. I find this to most likely be a conscious decision with some input delay from FSR or DLSS. It just lags, you'll routinely hit R/Q (default binds for items and healing) and it will not pop off a heal. You have to spam it completely. - Animations finishing lag a bit causing delay with your next. This is super frustrating because it will just stop sometimes- Invisible fucking walls- Hitboxes on bosses (specifically the one in Chapter 3), just have some really dogshit moments where an attack just blatantly misses as your staff spins through, but their AoE hits you and you're no where near it.If you made it to this point in my review, thanks. I normally write stupid reviews and just say fuck it on games that are good, but i wish this had a ""YEAH ITS GOOD NOT GREAT"" button. This game is the epitome of that. I'm super happy with it's success, and congrats to the devs. It's a great start but damn this game just has moments that piss me off, mainly the disk write error and crashing. The invisibile walls also will test your patience.Overall, buy it for $40 - 50 and enjoy it but I personally found myself comparing sekiro and stellar blade to this more favorably.(_)_):::::::ROCKETSHIP WITH LASER::::::::::::D~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
Positive,All my homies hate the celestial court
Positive,it the absolute greatest game i have ever played
Positive,"this game is amazing, its really fun and its a just hard enough to keep you coming back for the w. its a massive game with lots of secrets and surprises if you are willing to look for them and this is def one of the best game of the year if not the best game of the year. highly recommend it to anyone looking for an amazing game that wants a challenge and a fun exp"
Positive,"An awe-inspiring mythical adventure dripping with charm, culture, and creativity. It's beautiful and polished as hell. Just like Round 8 did with Lies of P, Game Science absolutely hit it out of the park with their first major project and you can easily see the huge amount of love and dedication they poured into it.It clearly draws some inspiration from the recent God of War installments but I think people are overstating the similarity. It doesn't have any of the quick-time events, platforming, or environmental puzzles that are emblematic of those games. God of War also feels significantly slower and more clunky compared to this game. I would say it is spiritually most similar to Sekiro but with more diverse combat thanks to the variety of stances, spells, and weapon arts.Highly recommend!"
Positive,"What I liked:- Amazing visuals - pure eye candy. Even better musics and voices.- Teaches you about Chinese culture.- Great design for some of the bosses, the most fun I had in a while running around and dodging all sorts of projectiles.- There is a lot of content, including a ton of bosses, secret areas and quests.- Although the game is huge, not a lot of enemies are recycled, which is highly appreciated.What I didn't like as much:- The devs tried too many things and to me it does not hold together very well. There is way too much diversity for me in terms of upgrades, relics, skills, armor, potions, vessels, etc. I beat the game in smash stance with 1 focus and never using any potions. However, it could have been worse if they didn't allow you to reset everything at will.- Lengthy dialogues that are quite boring compared to the amazing visual and auditory experience that is offered to you while those dialogues are running.- If you are used to Souls combat (and you're trying out this game because you've heard it's the same thing - spoiler it's not), the combat system can be a bit too much in Wukong. There's a lot more to it than dancing around with the boss by perfectly timing your iframes. You're also expected to use spells, skills and to transform into a frog mid-combat while snapping your fingers and stunning the boss.- While I liked most of the bosses, some have imperfect designs that require you to wait a lot, expect you to have a specific build or just spam status effects beyond imaginable.- I am pretty sure that people with photosensitive seizures will have issues in some bosses/areas, and I have not read any warning in this regard.7/10"
Positive,"Juicer of a game, Challenging and super fun! graphics are also fantastic"
Positive,"Got stuck on the tiger boss for so long that I started playing ""careless whisper"" in the back ground as we kept dancing around and getting to know each other better..."
Positive,This has to be the game of the year
Positive,"You get to play as a monkey with a staff, it's a 100/10 (I want to kill myself) edit: I really want to"
Positive,"Though it has some flaws, it is still beyond my expectation."
Positive,GOOD GAME & GOOD VIEW
Positive,"Its worth the hype. Dark souls 3, Ghost of Tsushima and Sekiro all into 1. And its fucking awesome."
Positive,Extraordinary gameplay mechanic combine with gorgeous scenic. Hate to say this but this one definitely will be 2024 GOTY for sure even though ELDEN RING DLC already did a wonderful job
Positive,Best Dragon Ball Z game since Budokai Tenkaichi 3
Positive,WA CAO NIMAAAAVERY NICE GAME CHINA NUMBER 1
Positive,"You wanna play as Sun Wukong, this is your chance !"
Positive,One of the best games I've ever played.
Positive,"Game beat my ass, and will continue to do so. I keep dying over and over, every time I die I get a little more annoyed, frustrated. Until i;m just watching a computer controlled npc beat the lights off me, and then it happens... the perfect dodge, then another and again yet another perfect dodge. Everything comes together, you're landing the combos, hitting the charges, using your arsenal. Bliss. Seriously, game is sick. Graphics are phenomenal and game play loop is challenging and rewarding. Its fantastic."
Positive,"It's very ""Trollslike"" for sure.-No toggle to run option ?                 (run is Shift and jump is L-CTRL??????)-Also you can't bind mouse buttons =((-Some map glitches where you get stuck or enemies corner you and you're stuck.-Heal and dodge don't always respond causing you to not heal, or you healing twice in a row because you spammed heal.-Other than that the story and voice acting is amazing.-chinese voice acting is great; havent heard the english yetI would recommend once they address those issues."
Positive,Sick of DEI terrorists ruing our games? Wukong rejects DEI cancer and makes one of the best... BUY IT!
Positive,"Challenging boss fights every 5 mins, incredible music, beautiful artwork, an absolute banger of a game."
Positive,game of the year! but it needs a map.
Positive,im on my third play through trying to unlock all the relics. I havent played a game this much in so long. monke game guudupdate: about to finish for the 4th time. its just so good. I need a DLC asap
Positive,Lovin it so far ^_^🦆 Sweet Baby🦆 Kotaku🦆 IGN :)
Positive,"Great game, feels like an amazing mix of a Souls game and God of War. Combat is fast-paced, fluid, and has a good amount of variety due to multiple different skills and abilities. The graphics/visuals in this game are beautiful and some of the best I have seen in a video game. It is linear but with a nice sense of progression and the boss fights are difficult without becoming not enjoyable. The story and lore are interesting too! Overall, this is a fantastic game worth the hype."
Positive,Already impressed after less than 1 hour of gameplay. Fighting is smooth and the scenes are stunning. The optimization isn’t bad at all for an ue5 game. I get steady 60fps on my 2080ti laptop with insanely beautiful graphics. 真的很惊艳
Positive,"Really fun action gameplay, the story is a sequel of Journey to the West after Wukong becoming the fighting buddha. No up sells, no paid wall content, no BS, you get everything the game has to offer in one price. Highly recommended."
Positive,Game of the Year 2024
Positive,"""Lacking in inclusivity and diversity""10/10"
Positive,Amazing game. Amazing monke
Positive,"Oh man, never thought this was this good! BEST GAME EVER 😍"
Positive,"Good game, a game without live services, micro-transaction, and DEI. fk sweet baby btw."
Positive,"Beautifully brutal.This game is breathtaking and cinematic on a different level, though very require reflexes of a juvenile.Will surely enjoy this one for a long time."
Positive,This is a great game with no politics of inclusivity and diversity shoved in it. It is very satisfying to play and overall lived up to the hype. The only small negatives are the the occasional performance stutter and  would have liked to have had a map for better navigation. Also a few more lasting full body transformations. This game is worth the money.
Positive,"GOTY 100 PERCENT. The graphics and the boss fight are insane, especially the chapter 3 and 4 which are super sick. Game Science rely put a lot of effort into this game. I have to say that the animations at the end of each Chapter are so sick that i rely hope they go on to make anime ngl XD. There are still some small problems tho, like the map not being provided, which caused me to get lost so many times... :( Anyways it is def the best game ive played this year."
Positive,You have shown me: Monkey.
Positive,This game is a pure masterpiece and this should be an example to other game developers of the level of quality we expect in their game.
Positive,GAME OF THE YEAR
Positive,Quite surprised how good this game is.

Positive,"This game will struggle with replay-ability due to its combat system which is satisfying and tight yet highly repetitive and lacking variety. After the 30-40 hour mark you will start to really notice just how much the combat is based on spamming basic attacks with the occasional mixup/spell. Stances also don't seem all that unique or customizable. There are only 3 stances and the pillar stance and thrusting stance are essentially the same stance when you realise both revolve around an evade followed by a long range counter attack. There are however hundreds upon hundreds of different unique enemies through the game, so this atleast helps with the combats replay-ability. Game hits 10/10 in almost every other department, so still very much worth atleast 1 playthrough."
Positive,"Beautiful scenery, good fighting techniques and good graphics."
Positive,"Cracking game. Some performance problems, but otherwise very polished, bug free, great combat and story. Very well worth the £."
Positive,This game is so beautiful
Positive,"Extremely good game. Not Game Of The Year good, but extremely good. I'll give you one warning and one warning only. This game is hard. When people say Souls like, they mean it's meant to be so difficult you'll want to bash your head against the wall. If you don't like that style of game, then you'll hate this. Please don't buy it and give a bad review because you hate this style of game to begin with. Like playing Baldur's Gate 3 and hating real-time strategy. Not every game is meant for every person.Pros; - Game play is fun and addictive. Leveling is fun, playing with different perk trees and armor is engaging.- Each new Chapter feels like a new world; Forest, Desert, Arctic, Caves (spiders), Lava - Most of the boss battles are unique, meaning the way they move, look, feel to fight in battle are all different. Keeps things fresh until the end.- Story is well written; even journal entries added story I really wanted to know.- This game looks so breathtaking. Many times I had to stop and look around. Brought back a lot of Uncharted 4 feels.- Ran butter smooth on my 3080 and Ryzen 5 5800x.Cons;- 1st real annoyance is the inability to pause cut-scenes. Anyone with wife, kids, or parents knows how important this feature is.- 2nd real annoyance is the devs specifically designed the game so you can easily miss quest lines for good spells/items/gear. Specifically to entice you to play NG+. That is not a challenge, it's an annoyance! And the game is not good in the way that makes NG+ a fun idea. It's a great game, simply not in that way.- Game play is not as fluid as BloodBorne. The un-interruptible chain attacks like in God Of War (4th) was annoying.- Bugs; Message stating ""Save failed..."", but it saves just fine. Message stating ""Partial controller support"" on steam, but controller is full functional.- Finally, that ending is trash. The idea that you must beat the game a second time to get the good ending and only by beating the game twice is a pure trash move. Though I did enjoy the final boss fight, simply didn't want it to be the last one.Well worth full price!!!"
Positive,A story of a monkey and pig that cleanse themselves from wokeness and all the unnecessary bullshit damaging the gaming industry. Would highly recommend.
Positive,"amazing graohics, storyline, fighting, and gameplay overall... its a definite GOTY no doubt. each chapter draws you into its timeline and world that you just dont want to leave after hours of gameplay!"
Positive,this game is what we as fans have been waiting for none of this modern audience woke stuff
Positive,Cant remember the last time I had this much fun with a single player game! Starting NG ++ this game is awesome.
Positive,"11/10 – started this game thinking I’d be a legendary hero; ended up getting repeatedly destroyed by mythical beasts and questioning my life choices. Black Myth: Wukong is like Dark Souls had a baby with a fever dream of ancient Chinese mythology, and that baby was raised on a strict diet of only the hardest boss fights imaginable. The graphics are so good, I’m 90% sure my computer’s considering calling in sick. I died about 200 times in the first hour (thanks to my stellar skills). Would recommend to anyone who thinks they’re ready to question their gaming skills, sanity, and patience."
Positive,best game ever 10/10 will love this
Positive,"I'm not good at these sorts of games, but I absolutely adore this game. It just feels special when you play it. Almost like it's slowly restoring your faith in gaming as a hobby. The hype is real. Experience it for yourself."
Positive,"amazing game 10/10 my GOTY so far ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ beautiful music and the animated scenes after each chapter are great and leave some emotion, so many bosses, so much fun."
Positive,Great fun game! Only gets better as you get into the lore and stories throughout this unique world. Highly recommend playing through in Chinese (subbed rather than dubbed) if you can.
Positive,I love monkeys
Positive,"I had a great time playing this game and this is what matters ultimately. Amazing experience, with most of its aspects on point.Worth the money and time spent."
Positive,Game of the year
Positive,game good monke together strong
Positive,"Two words, master piece"
Positive,This is like if Nioh 2 had all the fun elements that Sekiro has and wasn't so grindy. HIGHLY recommend to people either new to souls-likes or not amazing at them; there's always a way to make things more manageable.
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong  delivers a visually stunning and culturally rich experience that captivates from the very start.

Positive,monkey game good
Positive,"A Game That Will Stick With YouFrom the first fight, I was completely hooked by Black Myth: Wukong’s gameplay. It feels fluid, responsive, and incredibly satisfying. The developers have truly mastered the balance between challenge and reward—every encounter feels meaningful, whether you’re up against a minor foe or a towering boss. Combat is where the game truly shines, with a deep system that rewards skill, strategy, and quick reflexes.Wukong’s transformation abilities add a dynamic twist to the gameplay. Switching between forms to gain an edge in combat or solve puzzles creates a level of depth that goes beyond traditional action RPGs. Every transformation comes with its own unique abilities, encouraging experimentation and tactical thinking. This variety in combat kept the game fresh for me, even dozens of hours in. There’s always something new to learn, some new strategy to master, and that constant sense of progression is incredibly rewarding.The boss fights, in particular, are a standout. They are epic in scale, with each encounter feeling like an event in itself. These battles are challenging, but never unfair—victory feels earned and exhilarating. The game encourages you to learn from your mistakes, and overcoming these powerful foes delivers an immense sense of satisfaction.Black Myth: Wukong is one of those rare games that feels like an instant classic. It has heart, depth, and the kind of polish that makes it stand out among even the best AAA titles. From the jaw-dropping visuals and fluid combat to the rich storytelling and deep lore, this game offers so much to players without ever asking for anything in return beyond the initial purchase. It’s a complete package—a masterpiece in every sense of the word.I finished the game feeling exhilarated, satisfied, and yet somehow wanting more—an incredible testament to the experience it offers. I can confidently say that Black Myth: Wukong is not just one of the best games I’ve played in recent years, but one of the best games I’ve ever played, period. If you’re looking for a game that will challenge you, immerse you in a rich world, and offer hours of compelling gameplay without the need for microtransactions, look no further.Rating: 5/5 – This game is a triumph."
Positive,"TL;DR: Amazing game with a great story (Based on Journey to the West). The most breathtaking scenery I have probably ever seen in a game. First few times on each map, I rarely sprinted just to take my time and look around the outstanding details this masterpiece has to offer. Truly, a game worth calling a ""Masterpiece"". I'd give it a 9/10.Combat is great. Even though the majority of the emphasis is put on light attacks, there's still quite a few helpful and powerful skills to obtain that can and will give you the edge on fights. A wonderful detail I love about  it is that it gives you very specific items that counter very specific enemies or situations. Personally, I didn't use much of anything except the basic skills because I'm weird and I felt that I could get through better with those, but I can definitely see people at the very least enjoying the other options too.Scenery is absolutely 10/10. I love every single place I've been to in this game, with the exception of chapter 4, which I didn't like much, because I found the layout to be very confusing for no reason. But maybe it's supposed to be this way. As I briefly stated earlier, the devs put a lot of love, affection and care into the details spread around the maps, that oftentimes provide you with tidbits of extra lore. And that's a big plus for me.Apart from the gameplay cutscenes, which are phenomenal, you are also blessed with some high quality animated chapter-end cutscenes that further explain the story or backstory about what happened. They are quite short but are very concise and easy to understand, even just visually. Not to mention, very pretty.Controls with a controller (I haven't played with Keyboard + Mouse) are quite easy and straightforward and difficulty is medium-hard. As a souls-like games' enthusiast, I found most bosses to be normal difficulty. I usually killed most of them in 1-3 lives, except very specific ones and two more that were, in my opinion, annoyingly OP just for the sake of being annoyingly OP. Apart from that, I love the fact that there's so many bosses around. Makes me feel like I'm actually fighting with other very powerful entities instead of squeaky toys and trash mobs.Regarding music and sound overall, it's quite good, nothing extremely out there but nothing to scoff at either. There's definitely some banger tracks in there that you will most likely enjoy. Thanks for reading <3"
Positive,10/10 game of the year!story is amazing. graphics are amazing.all the reviews of it crashing or glitching you all just need to get a good PC brokies.
Positive,"A great middle ground between the ""hardcore"" games like the Soulsborne series and the more standard action-adventure games like God of War. While this game borrows some mechanics from both series, it has more than enough unique ones that it stands apart as its own thing. Everything from the combat animations, spells, enemy and boss designs and lore fragments display the passion and love the developers have for the source material and the game they're making, which is sadly lacking in games these days."
Positive,"Really interesting to see Chinese mythology portrayed like this in a video game. Not too familiar with it personally, so it was a nice breath of fresh air. The combat is fun and there's a lot of build variety. Sometimes the controls can feel a bit janky (feels like commands aren't queued up properly if your character is busy in an animation so it feels like you have to spam buttons to get one command out sometimes).The story was relatively interesting. The end chapter animations were a huge highlight and a wonderful little decompression moment after the (usually) intense chapter end bosses.Areas looked very beautiful but I definitely felt like level design itself was a bit lacking (even if the environments were gorgeous). Some areas dragged on for far too long and were kind of samey (chapter 5 really felt like it would never end). Overall, I definitely enjoyed the game and felt like the time I spent with it was worth it. I'm looking forward to the DLC.8.5/10"

Positive,Great game and no micro-transactions.  Just a complete good game.
Positive,"It's fun,Seem to be a rare trait for new titles now.Compare to Souls games- No soul drop = more casual dying- No block dodge only, gitgud or die a lot (which i am dying a lot)- build variety not as much (range focus, magic focus), but still decent amount of armor set & weapon buff- Mighty stick rule them all.recommended"
Positive,BEST GAME OF 2024
Positive,can be monkey definitely goty
Positive,buy it fr fr
Positive,I like the fun monkey game. Buy the fun monkey game. Discover the feeling of whacking things with sticks as hard as physically possible. Overcome anything with sheer will (and a stick).
Positive,"Eh, it's OK"
Positive,"Bello, poco da dire. Pieno di pregi, Grafica, gameplay, audio, tutto fantastico. Ha sicuramente qualche difetto tra cui la telecamera che a volte può non funzionare al meglio. Altro difetto i muri invisibili troppo frequenti in zone spesso che sembrano accessibili. Consiglio vivamente"
Positive,"I presume that every Chinese knows about who is Wu Kong, and so am I. Based on Journey to the West, one of China’s most iconic and influential works of literature, this game produce a masterpiece for games around the world. I don't want to put much attention to the striking visuals of exciting combat system which you must definitely know if you have tried this game. However, What impressed me most is the cultural connection with me, which I have never had before.I have experienced many great Western-developed games like God of War or Red Dead Redemption 2. To be honest that their  combat mechanics or art design are not worse than this game, even better at some point, but I don't think that I can fully comprehend the story and setting of the game due to the cultural difference. With creative reinterpretation, Black Myth Wu Kong inherit the spirit of the original work and depict a character vividly on the screen, a character who is well known by all of the Chinese players. It is a novel experience for us, that is also why it deserves such a high evaluation.And finally, may we can see more like this in the future."
Positive,"It's really surreal to see China, a country that is known for making bootleg games, gacha slot machine games and corporate garbage all of a sudden drop this massive love letter of a game to one of their most beloved stories ever told. I'm a huge fan of east asian culture and mythology so when I saw the trailer for this back in 2020 I was very excited. Now that I've played it, the only bad thing I can say about it besides the audio lag in the cutscenes was that it was exactly what I thought it was going to be; which is a great game with stunning visuals, interesting storytelling and fantastic music. Nothing really blew me out of the water (except for the secret final boss) because I had high expectations already.However, what I WASN'T expecting were the short animated films you get to see after you finish each chapter. Absolute masterclass animation from a country I have never seen produce high-quality art,  Each one has its own art style where none fall short or anything. The quality of these shorts is so well done that they almost become a reward for beating the chapters which made me excited to see the next one. The best thing about this is they didn't HAVE to do this, they could've just skipped the animated shorts together and had Eastern players rely on their knowledge of Journey to the West and Western players rely on lore YouTube videos to explain it to them.  It just shows that this project was purely made out of love which is what the best art is created from. I understand the importance of art is declining due to AI but it was a pleasure to witness this passion-filled masterpiece before it all came crashing down. This game deserves the success it got and I hope the developers are proud of themselves for not only making a good game but an outlet to tell the world of their culture and stories. I've learned so much through this game which is not something most games can offer me. <3"

Positive,"Did not expect to like this game due to difficulty, but I am loving it. Just the right amount of challenge. Much more of a hardcore action game than a souls-like, which I am happy about."
Positive,Not usually a fan of this genre but safe to say BM:W got me coming back for more.
Positive,the game follows the chinese mythology beautifully and the artwork and character design is marvelous overall
Positive,"Beautiful game but def not for the easily frustrated. It's hard, def a Souls like title. Well optimised and I enjoyed the story. Finished but doubt I will be back for more."
Positive,"This is an awesome & beautiful game.  Culturally rich, dynamic & well fleshed environment, fun story telling, graphically flawless.  A must play game!"
Positive,11 Bowls of rice out of 10 ! Thanks to Comrade Xi for such a gift from the party. I would have given the game 15/10 if it weren't for such an abundance of invisible walls.
Positive,"I went into Black Myth: Wukong with no real expectations, aside from a brief demo at Gamescom that left me impressed by the graphics. Having received the game for free, I’ve tried to keep an unbiased perspective.First off, the graphics are stunning—truly top-notch. I’m playing on cinematic settings at 1440p with an average of 120-130 fps, and the game runs incredibly well. The bosses are beautifully designed, and the dynamic combat really shines here, making the encounters visually impressive and fun to play.However, the game has its downsides. The difficulty is surprisingly low, especially if you’re used to games like Sekiro or ER (In terms of difficulty the game resembles Lies of P rather then FS games). The boss fights are easy, and the lack of any real challenge might disappoint veterans of the genre.Another issue is the exploration—too often, you’re blocked by invisible walls, which can be frustrating when you think you’ve found a new path only to realize it’s not accessible. The combat is decent, but nothing groundbreaking, and the level design, while visually appealing, is just alright. The soundtrack fits the theme, but it doesn’t stand out.Overall, I’d rate Black Myth: Wukong a 6/10. If you’re in it for the graphics and want to experience what Unreal Engine 5 can do, this game delivers. But at $60, it’s hard to justify the price—$20-$25 seems more reasonable. If you’re interested, I’d suggest waiting for a sale.If we set aside an unjustified price tag, I can recommend this game for a casual playthrough"
Positive,Can't hold back from recommending this game after completing chapter 4. So good!
Positive,Turns my computer into a sauna but it looks really nice and it's quite fun.
Positive,"The game is amazing. Great combat, great visuals, many secrets, and so many bosses and mini bosses to fight."
Positive,This game is not a soul-like game. The story is immersive and the graphic is so damn good 9.5 out of 10. Got my vote for Game of the Year.

Positive,"a literal piece of art, this game is a visual masterpiece as well as an enjoyable experience. If you are coming out of Elden Ring expecting something like it, this is different in many ways most notably not being open world whatsoever, however be ready for boss fights just as hard. The majority of negative reviews are from people complaining about a lack of diversity and inclusion, which is stupid considering that this is a game made in China by Chinese developers based on a centuries old Chinese novel about Chinese folklore. If you don't like the Chinese culture in this, then idk what to tell you."
Positive,I feel we got spoiled this year with a lot of great games this year and Black Myth: Wukong surly on top of this list..What a Great game..All I hope that Arabic Subtitle was added to the game to recommend it to my friends.
Positive,This game made me proud of my own people.
Positive,Amazing Story and Great Gameplay
Positive,GOTY....BETTER SOULS LIKE and much better Boss battles than ELDEN RING!!!
Positive,"this is one hell of a love letter for journey to the westpretty cool game, visuals are amazing even on optimized settings (even tho there are slight performance issues here and there), story is pretty good, gameplay is really fun once you unlock the things that make the combat flow properly, and good god the animations at the end of every chapter makes u feel emotional even if u don't know whats going on, solid 9/10 for me."
Positive,"Edit : Après 60h de jeu et avoir bouclé le jeu, je peux vous confirmer que c'est un GOTYUn superbe Souls lite, des animations dingue, un arbre de compétence touffu, des combats grandioses, un maniabilité parfaite. Je recommande les yeux fermés !"
Positive,"This game is great and a serious contender for game of the year. The boss fights are epic, the graphics are beautifully rendered. The game runs well on my 3080 TI machine that is a few years old now.The Chinese mythology thematic is a breath of fresh air after playing so many Western and Japanese games for a while now.I love how the game really focuses on new content and avoids recycling enemies, the game is dense from a content perspective and doesn't spend a lot of time making you watch lame story or trudge through endless hordes of the same weak mob or having to hunt down every path for treasure chests. Just boss fight, little rest against 5 trash mobs, boss fight, repeat.If I had a gripe it'd be mostly that the level design isn't very good at directing players at which way to go. It can be non-obvious what is a path to explore vs an invisible wall. However, the levels are more linear like DevilMayCry or the pre-rework God of War games. Honestly I prefer that to some of the open world games that have you swinging your sword or rolling into every wall to see if it breaks. They also avoid any cheap tricks that just try to catch you out as you progress through the levels.[Update after finishing the game]Still think the game is great after finishing it. Everything above is still true. Very likely game of the year this year. Honestly the creators ""Game Science"" deserve all the accolades they're receiving for this game.It doesn't take too much away from the game but the level design could use more work. The levels are beautiful but really hard to navigate.It has a great ending and the last couple boss fights are some of the best in the game. It makes Chinese mythology seem really interesting and I'm certainly curious about Journey to the West. The themes left me contemplative about the nature of freedom and good and evil which I wasn't expecting from an action game about a monkey of merit."
Positive,"Amazing Game, Fun combat, and enjoyable story. I love the amount of bosses in the game, and i honestly dont think theyre all that difficult either, some of them take a few tries but theyre not that bad to get a hang of. The combat is fun and flows really well, and I think the spells you get in the game are genuinely enjoyable to use. Graphically the game looks gorgeous, and each of the areas ive gone to so far have been completely unique environment while also maintaining a level of how good they look, and capture their own environments. I think the one complaint I have so far is the camera for some bosses feels not quite right, and it feels more like youre fighting against the camera, this only really came up against one boss at the start of Chapter 3. Its been very fun to explore, and try to find everything in each area, i actually still have to finish fully exploring chapter 3, but i tried to go through both chapter 1 and 2 to make sure i find every boss in each level so i can fight them. For difficulty, ive never felt like i needed to leave a boss and grind levels before i could beat it. A good number of the bosses ive managed to beat in one or two tries, even a boss that people were saying was annoying only took 2 tries. The number of bosses that ive needed more than 2-3 tries for is probably less than 5 so far, and even then its enjoyable to learn their movesets Playing a game with Wukong, and all of the chinese mythology has genuinely been enjoyable, and thank god the developers didnt pay for ""diversity consulting""  at the end of the day is the game fun? Yes. thats all i care about not about being represented"
Positive,"Beautiful fun fair game. Definitely recommend to folks wanting to dip their toes into souls-like. My only complaint with the game is having no map and getting lost sometimes, but other than that, fantastic game. I've heard some folks having performance issues, but I did not have any. 0 lag and buttery smooth for me."
Positive,"Every encounter is a test of skill and strategy, making each victory immensely rewarding. The attention to detail in the environment is awe-inspiring. The developers have crafted a game that not only honours its mythological roots but also pushes the boundaries of what we can expect from an action RPG. I honestly believe this is a 10/10 experience, and I couldn’t recommend it more.Smash stance for the win."
Positive,"Played on PC with Linux (AMD CPU + Radeon 7900XT + NoRaytracing) as well as Windows (AMD CPU + RTX 3900Ti + Full Raytracing). Overall, barring a few technical problems this game for what it is a very great game. Highly recommend if you're into mythology. Don't be overwhelmed by combat if you're soulslike combat isn't for you, its more similar to God of War and on the easier side of things. (Things of note, there is no difficulty slider)This game is amazing reminding of God of War (2018) on PS4. I would say this game feels like God of War type Action Adventure with sprinkles of soulslike formula here are there, this isn't really your traditional soulslike. Speaking of lore, there is a rich history and this current story seems to pick up after journey to the west. This is not really a retelling of the same story but more akin to loose continuation. Combat is great and fluid.This game while built using latest and greatest of UE5 seems to use low quality textures at times, vram for the GPU never exceedes 8.0 GB which is most commonly availble memory configurations in Mid to Higher spec. The world is so beautiful that it makes you look at stuff like the rock infront of you and it can sometimes look blurry.This game is certified as having DualSense Native Support, be warned IT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT AT THIS TIME.To clarify, enabling Steam Input will solve your problems but that is converting Xbox Inputs to Playstation Inputs. This is not Native Dualsense Controller Support, Haptics and Triggers are not working as expected.And do not use any sort of controller emulators like DSX, the latency is off the charts because frame generation itself adds latency. At this time, just use any controller with SteamInput.I want to give benefit of the doubt and say that this is one of the overlooked areas of development most likely given that this game also released on PS5.Beyond the problems mentioned in some of the digital foundry videos, on windows, tinkering is required for non 40 Series Nvidia Cards, since I had a 30 Series Card, frame generation is not available but there is a mod available on nexusmods which runs FSR in DLSS mode with FrameGeneration which helped with full RT. On Linux, I am running this game similar to how steamdeck works with its gamemode. Game runs with no performance dips and with consistent FPS. Surprisingly works extremely well with latest Proton GE (9-11) at the time with little to no changes needed, 7900XT handles Cinematic Quality at 60 FPS constant with FrameGeneration enabled and FSR at 75%. Little to no hitches.Loading times are faster on Linux (EXT4) when compared to windows(NTFS).

Positive,WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL
Positive,Really fun game but a bit of Monkey/Taoist/Buddhist lore that will probably be confusing if you don't know anything about any of this lol.I think the story is easy enough to understand the basics coming in though!
Positive,dark souls for dads
Positive,"Fascinating game by Game Science! This is the first ever Journey To the West related game I've ever played and so far being surprised on how well this game is doing. Firstly, the gameplay is one of the best part of this game. There are lots of system to play with regarding the transformation, spell and heavy attack options. Each skills have their own purpose and can be use in diffferent situations, offer large flexibility and a whole lot of fun to play. The monsters are considered hard, but with proper use of these systems, you can pass it quite easily. 9.5/10 for gameplay.Next, the story is very good and deep. It is about the after story of the Journey To the West. We can have a different view aside form the main story and it focus about the darkside regarding the story of Journey to the West. The story are well written and presented in a cinematic form, which greatly helps in immersive experience. After each chapter, there is also a short drawing animations that present and summarize the background story of the current chapter or might highly relevant to the other chapter, which even make you more interested in what will happen next. The game also gives you a menu list of enemies that you fought or person that you met along the journey, along with a long background information. The musics are also very well chosen and suits the situation well, especially the musics after the transformation, definitely will lit you up. 9/10 for story and music.However, this game also content of some downside that might ruin your experience, and the most mentioned will definitely be the map. There are NO mini map in this game, making it a very hard time for me to memorize and walk around the map without any idea where am I going. The graphics and views of the game is good with the help of unreal 5 engine, but sometimes I might experience lag spike when playing with monsters that have lots of effect, like fire or lightning, which might destroy your gaming experience. The cameras are also very frustrating, especially when playing against large monsters or in small spaces. These are the spots that might need further improvement or optimization.Overall, this is a fantastic games with interesting gameplay, graphics, stories and music. There are flaws in this game, but the goods overshine the bads and gives me a very good experience. To be mentioned, there are alot of side quest and hidden boss in this game, which you can find out if you miss any boss in the enemy list, make sure you run through the whole map patiently to not miss any good contents. Recommend this to every action games lover. 9/10"
Positive,Ape together stronK
Positive,"Game is awesome. Gameplay is rewarding, not super difficult but not too easy either. Lots of great options and combat skills to choose from, not to mention armor and weapon choices as well. Scenery is gorgeous. Highly recommend."
Positive,"One of the best games i have played for many years. Since gaming from the 1980' s it reminds me of those days the difficulty, the challenge but a enjoyable one. polished and ready straight out of the box. None of this early access rubbish. A masterpiece of a game that i will strive to complete although with my busy schedule these days it will take a long time! 10/10."
Positive,"Wukong is a good game,but it had the potential to be great.It has fantastic character designs and visuals,and the combat is fluid and enjoyable for the most part.Unfortunately the level design is atrocious,riddled with dead ends and invisible walls, think you've found a hidden path?a secret area maybe?nope, a big ol' invisible wall is there to slap you in the face,my personal highlight was getting stuck behind an invisible wall in a boss arena mid fight.The camera in some of the boss fights is a joke (looking at you Kang-Jin Loong) to the point where you cant even see the boss.Imagine giving bosses literal cut scenes for an attack that leave you on one hit, that's not difficulty, that's bs.Normal enemies feel like a waste of time, and boss difficulty is inconsistent.Performance on the whole is good,but i have had a few crashes to desktop resulting in being put back at the start of an area that you have just cleared,and very annoying input latency from time to time.The souls-like tag should be removed, don't buy this expecting Dark souls or Elden ring,you'll be disappointed,an action game with a few difficult bosses doesn't make a souls-like,plays more like a God of war boss rush,but with less substance between fights.All that aside, i am mostly enjoying it, just not as much as i thought i would,does not deserve to be rated at overwhelmingly positive, 6/10 on a good day."
Positive,I wish the game has Vietnamese translation. Many far west languages have translation but nothing for the boy next door.
Positive,human weakmonke stronk
Positive,"it took me back to the journey to the west. I never experienced this kind of gameplay + Chinese-type story in a video game, it feels so great! can't wait to see what kind of monsters & BOSS fight & mystery stories awaiting, just keep playing it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Circle 2 finished, now I am in Circle 3. it is not perfect, and we can tell that Game Science chose to cut some contents and sacrificed something in map & yaoguai design in chapter 5&6, but it just feels so great to keep playing it with different BD, it is my GOTY. And, I need the DLC, I know you guys have something hidden in the pocket, come on, show us, Game Science, ASAP please"
Positive,"This review is based on my experience of seven hours of game-play or completing chapter one.Pros-1) Amazing graphics especially with ray tracing cranked.2) The story is unadulterated i.e. the writer/creator is not warping his story in the name of diversity something which game reviewers criticise it for.3) Fast and immersive game play with the right amount of difficulty.4) Movement is good for the most part.Cons-1) The distant textures are a bit hazy (maybe due to artifacts) especially the trees.2) Camera especially while fighting bosses in the corner is frankly terrible.3) Stutters when going to a new zone is unavoidable even with a fast gen 4 SSD.4) Auto target lock is very inconsistent.Overall-Pretty fun game to play especially if you like games like God of War (PC) and even though the game is quite hard, it's fun once you get the hang of it."
Positive,Mokey with stick hurt bad guy. I like some?
Positive,Game of the centuryTaiwan #1
Positive,Invisible Wall Wukong is a game about trying to jump over small obstacles and realizing you can't because there's an invisible wall.Also putting achievements over a bunch of items rarely dropped from mobs in a secret area of the game or plants that respawn every 30 minutes is just friggin stupid.
Positive,"4hr in so far. Good:* no lag and glitch* actions are smooth* actions is responsive* graphic is good* cinematic done very well* once you got to higher level and unlock more ability it get fun* interface is simple but user friendlybad:* map is a bit linear (don't expect Dark Soul or Elden Ring exploration style)* level start a bit slow, so early game is a bit boring* no map, maybe not really matter much as the map is linear but sometime i get confuse where am ioverall i think the game worth 10/10"
Positive,0% doodoo100% pure enjoymentgame looks and plays like all those trailers which were seriously TUFFu must buy this right now OR ELSE
Positive,"This game is breath of fresh air. In sea of shitty mediocre ""AAA"" games every now and then a gem comes along and reminds me why I enjoy gaming."
Positive,"its fantastic, from the graphics to the gameplay to the way the story is told"
Positive,"The fact that I might have a game that would displace Elden Ring as my favorite game of all time is saying something. I will come back and edit this when I am done, but as far as 1.5hrs goes I am enjoying myself very much.Edit 1: My friend made a good point. The only way to play this game is with Chinese audio and subtitles in your native language. Mandarin is a very beautiful language and it just makes the game that much more immersive."
Positive,"I like this game more then I expected too.  This isn't a true souls like per say, I would put it in the vein of maybe the Remnant series.  So far for me at least I have not run into any technical issues with the exception of a few frame dips here and there,  My only complaints Is unlike Remnant this game has no map whatsoever, no over map, no mini map not even a direction bar. I can get turned around pretty easy in these types of games and some kind of map would have been nice.My only other complaint is about mouse and keyboard.  I know the game wants you to use a controller, but for me that is NOT an option as I am TERRIBLE on a controller.  The game somewhat lets you rearrange the key binds but its very limited.  It also knows you if you have side buttons on the mouse but what let you bind to them, which makes no sense.     I am still early in the game at the time of  this writing  and other then those small complaints, I am enjoying the game so far."
Positive,"This game relieves my childhood memories when I was a little kid happily watching Journey to the West on TV. To many of us Asian kids, Wukong was the very first idol. This game makes our dream come true: ""Become our beloved idol"".Update: I just finished the game with True Ending. What can I say... I'm looking forward to the sequel. The game is amazing. There are tons of secrets and hidden quests. You will feel satisfied every time you discover a secret. There are many awesome things in the game. Yet there are still many things that it can be improved on. Anyways, personally, I will give the game 9.5/10.  Btw, this game is one of the rare cases that make me feel excited collecting Achievements.PS: In my opinion, the game has done a good job in its translation to English. But... the translation of names is quite... funny. It should just leave the names in pinyin translation (Chinese names) just like many Japanese games do to their games. To me, the best translation is Vietnamese which is unofficial... It can translate the names, the poems,... everything perfectly."
Positive,"Having played for a handful of hours now I'm still enjoying Wukong as much as I did in the first hour I played it, which is honestly somewhat surprising as Souls-likes aren't my typical fare and usually don't keep my attention.To Game Science, be sure to include a sardonic ""Thank you"" to Kotaku et al. in any award acceptance speeches you give because the number of players their temper tantrums drew to your game is decidedly non-zero. Well Played."
Positive,MONKE GO BRRRRR
Positive,"I've been waiting nearly three years for this game, and wow, the graphics and combat are surprisingly fun!"
Positive,GAME OF THE YEAR
Positive,Definitely the GOTY to me
Positive,"Combat felt weird at first, but once you get used to it its soooooooooooooo much fun. If you played God of War or God of War Ragnarok youll love this game. It has the same system as that."
Positive,Reject Humanity; Embrace Monke.
Positive,after playing 100+ hours on ps5 i m just gonna say buy it !GOTY for sure.
Positive,"GOTY!!! This video game has been one of my favorite!!! You definitely should have a try and this game will help you step into a fascinating world you've never been to. The myths in the game will reveal the essence of Chinese 5000 years' culture, which is so profound and epic; and WHY NOT HAVE A TRY!!!   YOU CANNOT MISS IT!!!"
Positive,Amazing game! FINALLY great to see a fully finished game on release. So happy this was not released as an EA like so many games. Def has made the games experience top notch. Graphics and story are on par to be top 2024 game of the year!
Positive,"1440p, RTX 3080 user here.The game is awesome, and it runs very well if tweaked correctly - below are my suggestions.First of all, download DLSS Swapper, as the game is using an older DLSS version you can improve on it by swapping to the latest version (3.7.2).About the graphic settings, these are the 2 most demanding ones:Shadows > going from VERY HIGH to HIGH I was able to gain 8-10 fps on averageGlobal Illumination > same as shadows, going from VERY HIGH to HIGH I was able to gain 10 fps on averageSo with only these two settings I went from 55 to 75 fps.All the other settings give minor fps returns.My suggested settings for people with an rtx 3080 / 3070ti are:- DLSS at 80%- Textures on Cinematic- Shadow on High- Global Illumination on High- Everything else on very high (you can crank up Hair Quality and Vegetation Quality to Cinematic with just a 2-3 fps loss)The only downside for me at the moment is the lack of a FOV slider.I'm very sensitive to narrow FOV but so far I was able to play without getting sick, will update this review if things change."
Positive,"No lag, better optimization than most triple A games. Combat is good. Haven't gotten into much of the story yet and will see. But just for the optimization and no lag, it's a 10/10."
Positive,black myth monke dies once

Positive,monke fight monke win
Positive,"Yep.. I been waiting for a souls-like game or just any game with any genre that is similar to dark souls/elden ring typa combat.. THIS IS THE GAME I BEEN WAITING FOR!! Its hard but also casual at the same time and its difficult in an insanely fun way, its incredibly rewarding with exploration and bosses its my dream game honestly. Sucks I don't have that much of a decent PC so I can barely run it while it still looks good but I am grateful to play it on a functional standard."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a breathtaking, third-person action game heavily inspired by the Chinese classic ""Journey to the West."" It’s not just another adaptation but a unique follow-up that reimagines the world of Sun Wukong with dazzling artistry and incredible combat.You play as “The Destined One,” a monkey warrior tasked with retrieving six relics to revive the legendary Sun Wukong. Though deeply tied to the source material, those unfamiliar with the novel may find the story hard to follow. However, the stunning visuals and creative narrative make the experience engaging, even without a complete understanding of the references.The combat system is fast-paced and empowering, more reminiscent of ""Nioh"" than traditional Soulslike games. Armed with Wukong’s iconic staff, you can switch stances and use a vast array of magical abilities and transformations, allowing for strategic and fluid battles. Boss encounters are epic, with each battle being uniquely crafted to offer variety and challenge. However, there are some technical issues such as occasional glitches with hitboxes, camera problems, and progression balancing. These flaws, while frustrating, do little to dampen the overall excitement.Black Myth: Wukong excels in its artistic presentation. The game world is visually stunning, filled with intricate details in the environment, character models, and enemies. The immersive world design, backed by top-tier graphical technology, makes it one of the most beautiful games ever. The varied enemy designs and gorgeous animations for each chapter's conclusion contribute to its standout experience.While the gameplay is exhilarating, it does have its flaws. Invisible walls disrupt exploration, lip-sync issues in English voiceovers are noticeable, and some lighting and pop-in problems occasionally break immersion. Despite these minor flaws, they don’t detract from the game’s overall brilliance.Black Myth: Wukong offers an unforgettable experience with its exhilarating combat, massive boss fights, and sheer passion from the development team. Despite a few technical and design issues, the game’s strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. Highly recommended for action and mythology fans alike.Score: 10/10An absolute must-play masterpiece."
Positive,"I've been playing 2.7 hours so far so am happy to share initial  thoughts on the game from a technical level mostly since the gameplay mechanics are excellent and fluid/intuitive and technical ability seems to be the biggest talking point across the web.For ref, my system is fairly capable but not exactly the latest Ryzen X3D with DDR5 etc:» 12700KF» 64GB DDR4 3600MHz» 4090 undervolted» 4k QD-OLED 240Hz» Samsung 990 Pro NVMeHere's 24 mins of my first play after the initial intro act of the game. Really good have to say, there is some traversal stutter but it's noway near the level of Jedi Survivor. It's infrequent enough that I could just ignore it:My shader pre-comp time was quicker than what Digital Foundry had too, it was 2m 40s on a 12700KF.Performance using the RT Very High preset and Very High GFX preset is excellent, The benchmark result between Cinematic and Very High GFX preset was the difference of 1fps on the average metric.RTSS bench report for the forest gameplay and boss fight segments:Average framerate : 98.5 FPSMinimum framerate : 85.4 FPSMaximum framerate : 111.6 FPS1% low framerate : 71.5 FPS0.1% low framerate : 21.5 FPSSome additional notes:» The texture shimmering seen in the stand-alone Benchmark Tool does not exist in the release version of the game. The video does show some shimmering but this is not visible in the actual game so I guess capturing has caused this...» Performance in person is very smooth with only very few traversal stutters as you can see from my frametime graph.» Cinematic preset does NOT look any different to Very High, as noted by Digital Foundry. Cinematic in UE5 is really for movies.» The game ships with old versions of dll files for Super Resolution and Frame Generation. You may want to update them manually and enable Preset-E for DLSS using DLSSTweaks.» The Ray Reconstruction DLL file is the latest version, but according to Digital Foundry, RR is not used in the release version of the game (yet).» There is no Reflex toggle in the menus, mouse camera latency is not noticeable at all so I am assuming Reflex is being used internally when Frame Gen is enabled.» You cannot remap control buttons to the mouse back/forward buttons.» The default button for jump is CTRL, who even plays like that lol....» The combat mechanics are quick to get used to, it's my first play of a game like this and I'm already getting the gist of it within the first 30 mins after the intro act.» Even though the mouse sensitivity for box axis is set to the same value, vertical camera movement feels slightly lower than horizontal. This seems intentional by design, odd at first but I quickly got used to it.» There is no FOV slider.- The skills tree and inventory system seems fine.» The visual quality using upscaler 50% scale with a 4K output resolution is excellent. There is a bit of sharpening applied internally with no setting to adjust it, but I like sharpening anyway so have no problem with this.» Zero stability issues, no crashes or other bugs so far.» The difficulty level is quite taxing, as you reach the bosses they are not forgiving lol! Provides a nice challenge. If you die you resume from the last checkpoint shrine which may annoy some, though you do retain anything you unlocked before dying so don't have to do those again.TL;DR:Game's excellent as a game, some traversal stutter but nothing major, WAY less than Jedi Survivor/Dead Space Remake. Visually stunning even without RT Very High (Path Tracing), but looks like offline CGI with it on. Smooth frametimes and motion."
Positive,I'm pleasantly surprised at how good the game is. It reminds me more of Souls-Like + Nioh. Great combos and fun boss fights.EDIT:IF you have an older PC:  purchase Scaling Type: Nvidia or AMDFrame Gen: 2.3Mode: x2 or x3Draw FPS: [on]Capture API: DXGI; if black screen try othersHope this helps.

Positive,"An insanely good well polished Action RPG Game. No micro transactions, no pay walls, and no battle passes. Just a great game with amazing game play and storyYou aren't babied and told where to go, you figure everything out as you play along and the game is fairly difficult. This is the first game I've bought in years where I haven't even been able to put it down. And even after you beat the game there's still a lot of replay-ability with NG+A perfect example of how video games should still be made."

Positive,"齐天大圣！！！Fantastic take on Journey to the West by the developers. Combat is dynamic and weighty. Despite borrowing elements from Dark Souls it is not overly punishing, leaning more into the power fantasy of playing the Great Sage himself.Many references are made to the novel throughout the game, but western fans will still be able to enjoy the story without background knowledge.Highly recommend fans of Journey to the West and Dark Souls fans to give this game a try!"

Positive,"Is Action RPG/Soulslike the best genre ever created? Oh yes, yes it is."
Positive,Amazing game 10/10 would recommend
Positive,ji ji ji zhi zhi zhi
Positive,Now i can retire gaming this game is monkey hard holy shit
Positive,"First of all, thanks to NVIDIA GeForce for providing me with a free copy of Black Myth: WukongMy Review:One of the best single-player games of 2024 so far.8.5/10 for mePros:-Incredibly satisfying combat and moveset.-Stunning graphics, thanks to UE5 and Kudos to Game Science for adding intricate details like the environment following the staff's movement, such as leaves, snow, and other particles.-Story-rich and engaging. The story is truly amazing, and every character, even the enemies, has a compelling backstory.-NG+ mode. Highly replayable with multiple endings.-Meaningful side missions.Cons:-Lack of a map. Even though it's not an open-world game, the absence of a map can make it feel incomplete and confusing at times.-Some side missions without clear clues. At least, include some hints or lore to help players unlock these missions, TBH i must read some guides to unlock some side missions."
Positive,"Edit: Black myth: Wukong is a game that is really good in most aspects of it, you can easily get a bit turned around when exploring but that is about it for real criticism.However for me this game just doesn't captivate me, it lacks that thing that makes it feel special when playing. For me it is just a game that i will enjoy playing but will not stick with me in any way.Edit 2: It just feels like it such a game game even with how amazingly good it is. Like ""I have done this before"" or ""I have played like this before"" even if it is new and i haven't done those things. I have no idea why, but for some odd reason that is how it feels for me."
Positive,monke bam bam
Positive,"pros: +good story         +best looking graphics         +fun, fluid combat         +excellent voice acting; ""both in chinese and english""cons: -invisible walls!!!         -invisible walls in boss fights are gamebreaking         -invisible walls at deadends"
Positive,"It's a beautiful action game taking its inspiration from ""Journey to the West"".The music are nice and both the Chinese and the English voices are very well made.There is a lot of exploration to do and the game opens progressively as you go further while staying generally linear.Combats are fun if sometimes a bit difficult.Losing isn't punishing at all as you don't lose anything. As stated many times this is not a Souls.A run is expected to last from 30 to 50 hours depending on how much you explore."
Positive,"One of the best ARPGs of all time! Breathtaking graphics, adrenaline-pumping actions, and a heartfelt story, making Black Myth: Wu Kong a must-play for any gamer."
Positive,"Game is peak, return to monke"
Positive,i am able to hit enemies with a stick feel very powerful
Positive,Monke with stick
Positive,"This game is doing things just right. The awesome fighting, boss variations and a lot of them too, game length, the levels, the lore are all that describe this great game.This is not a souls like game at all. You lose nothing upon your character dying and it is generally not as punishing like souls-like in many aspects. This game is more like God of War, essentially a big adventure in which you discover the lore, you choose and upgrade your character's abilities and spells that are available for you to use and you can even swap them at will at the resting place for free.It borrows many lessons, mostly quality of life things from other successful games. eg. you spawn next to boss rooms when you die, mob killing is not annoying, minimal amount of cutscenes and gameplay disruptions and many many more.The game is just right. You should definitely own it in your library. And play it. And finish it."
Positive,"Gameplays, Graphic, etc. Overall 10/10"
Positive,Monke together strong
Positive,"I am not much of a souls player, but Black Myth Wukong is the perfect balance of difficulty and fun. Highly recommend it!"
Positive,"Very fun, very entertaining, give it a try.."
Positive,Great single-player story game profesionally made by an independent studio without modern marketing bullshit and with decent optimisation. Support the devs if you believe in the bright future of gaming.
Positive,Just amazing not only the game but the art and the music
Positive,"OK.  Had I not gotten this for free, I probably would not have played it.  At least, not yet.  The reviews comparing this to Dark Souls would have chased me off...and with good reason.  It IS very Souls-like.  Comparisons to Fallen Order are also very appropriate.  So take me at my word, if these descriptors seem like it may not be your cup of tea......it probably won't be.That being said, I DID get this free for buying a 4080 Super.  As it is, I am running a very strong rig and this game is running at full tilt capability.  It is beautiful.  It is smooth.  It is a VERY GOOD game with clearly a LOT of love poured into the story, artwork, and music.  I worry about those who may not have as strong a rig and whether it will perform properly for them, but for me.....it has been near perfection from day one.  Even my temperatures haven't been that high with high 70's being my peak spikes.  It has run great.  If nothing else, other devs should look here for how to release their games.So yes, I have met a few bugs, but the bugs I have seen have been graphical, not gameplay based.  I've dealt with the first few bosses/sub-bosses and even beat the first ""optional boss"".  So I feel I have a solid grasp on gameplay.  It is challenging, though not as bad as Dark Souls (again....I think Fallen Order would be a closer comparison).  You will die.  You will probably die quite a bit.  It will frustrate.  It will annoy.  That is what these games are designed to do.  However, the controls are smooth, weapons and skills at your disposal are plentiful, and nothing has really felt ""impossible"".  I'm sure, as the game progresses, this will change.The story, while I find it to be the weaker aspect of the game, is still engaging and fun to see unfold.  Characterization isn't really the strong suit.  It's ""good enough"".I don't usually like jumping in with a review so soon after starting a game, but I really do feel like the game gives you a solid feel for itself quickly.  I'd even feel comfortable saying that, within the 2 hour mark, you should able to decide if you want to slog through this or not.  With that in mind, I have no problem giving this a recommend.  What is there, is done exceptionally and for those on the fence.....you should give it a try.Edit:I've now sunk an additional 19 hours in to this game.  I have been doing as much of a completionist run as I can and, as such, I am only at Chapter 3.  However, this is also why I don't like jumping in with a review with less than double digit hours in a game.  While my overall recommendation doesn't change and the praise I mentioned still holds.....some issue have begun to rear their ugly head and I feel it is important to mention them for people buying this as well as the developers if they read these reviews.Firstly, I have now died twice from using my ""projectile block"" move.  Movement doing it is clumsy and there have been a couple instances now where I attempted to use it and it took me right over a ledge.  HIGHLY, annoying.....especially when you are supposed to walk a narrow path with arrows being shot at you.  Some tweaking needs to be done in this respect.I have begun to run into more ""bugs"" that are becoming increasingly more ""invasive"".  Twice I somehow got an invisible wall between me and the Loong Dragon fight early in Chapter 3.  I couldn't walk out on the lake and the dragon couldn't come on land......however it could still hit me.  This barrier existed until I rested at the shrine.  Additionally, I am having more sounds and music cut out and frame skips.  Not ""horrible"", but a significant drop in quality and cause for concern.Camera work is getting clumsier now.  With interactions with enemies more and more frequently involving more than one at a time, it's been frustrating me that the camera will start spinning or jerking or zooming in really tight making seeing what's going on tougher.  It also makes engaging such groups much more difficult than it already is.  In a game where just one enemy is strong enough to kill you, these issues really need ironing out.Overall, I am having a blast.....but if these issues start compounding, I have concerns for what the late game may bring."
Positive,"Best intro scene I've ever seen in my entire life.  I wont be surprised if this wins game of the year.  Also, Monkey."
Positive,Perfect game forever
Positive,"He once told me, ''Out of sight, out of mind is a fool's task; seeing but seeing through is what wise men do''.BUT DIDN'T HE TURN MAD BY WHAT HE SAW TOO?"
Positive,The fights are hype.
Positive,"I love it. Worth everything I paid for it. I am having so much fun with it. i have a few nitpicks that could be better, such as no mini map and the story can be a bit confusing at times. Other than, it's an absolute masterpiece!"
Positive,Feels extremely fitting to play this while enjoying this game.it gets a little silent at times. So I play this to lighten the mood
Positive,"AMAZING, GOTY. WHAT CAN I SAY?"
Positive,I've only just begun this game but it has been amazing. the combat is very easy to learn and the bosses are very satisfying once you get passed them.
Positive,"Soul like game tapi gak ada penalty, bagus lah"
Positive,APES TOGETHER STRONG!
Positive,Who's The little good monkeeee!
Positive,i BORN IN YEAR OF MONKEY I GREW UP ON ISLAND OF WITH MONKEYS I'VE LOVES MONKEY MAN SINCE I WAS BOY BEST GAME :D
Positive,"Just finished the final boss. Still looking for ch 6 secret realm. But wow. 10/10. This was one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. Story, detail, game play. Everything was incredible. The cinematics were on par if not the best I've seen in any game ever. You can see how much love the developers put into it. Personally as a souls type game this beats Elden Ring for me. Absolutely amazing."
Positive,"On the easier side of ""Souls-Like"" and plays more into the Action.Monke see, Monke Kill."
Positive,"真的很令人感動，美術，戰鬥，還有那個中文配音實在都太好了。雖然打那個大頭和尚幽魂讓我從個位數等級一路死到雙位數才打贏，但是覺得過程是美好的。不過那個完美閃避的判定時間點感覺會飄，有時候覺得該閃過的招卻沒有閃過，會讓人覺得煩躁。總而言之，好遊戲，快來玩!I really appreciate the art, aesthetics and combat , also the Chinese dub is superb!  I managed to defeat that big head purple(?) monk after my level went from single to double digits, but a W is a W, the satisfaction after defeating him is amazing. One thing I would like to note is that perfect dodge timing seems kinda unstable, sometimes you thought you do the perfect dodge and you either got hit or only do a normal roll, and that kinda annoyed me time to time, but overall the game this game is great, you really can feel the dedication of the devs, no other agenda nonsense, definitely recommend.Buy it and play it! Monke!"
Positive,"Simply a wonderful game. A piece of art.No notable problems throughout the entire playthrough.Beautiful visuals and great gameplay.I’m already looking forward to the DLCs or a sequel in the Black Myth series.Challenging fights but never too frustrating.Some fights, especially the one against the hundred-eyed Daotist, felt a bit unfair and not as precise, but overall, the boss battles were all fantastic.Definitely the GOTY for me so far. I haven’t played such a good game this decade."
Positive,"It's like God of War and Dark Souls had the most beautiful baby!Thoroughly impressed with performance, game play  and visuals even after just under two hours of game play. Looking forward to sinking all available time into this game!***Edit*** - after another 4 hours or so of playing, I can confidently say I've yet to encounter a performance issue, bug or anything to indicate the game is nothing less than optimized. combat is fluid. This is the combat style that makes you feel like you're truly a hero and apart of something epic. Kudos and well done to devs. This is a new standard for souls like games."
Positive,"I've been highly anticipating this game since it was first announced in 2020 and it exceeded my expectations after playing through and getting both endings. Great storytelling (based off of one of the most interesting stories, ""Journey to the West""), beautiful visuals, and fun combat. The gameplay is more akin to God of War with some Souls-like elements, very progression-based and linear. My favorite aspect of this game are definitely the graphics & visuals (the opening scene alone gave me chills!), while the story and combat kept me hooked. One of the most immersive games I've ever played- well done by Game Science, they knocked it out of the park with this masterpiece. Definitely Game of the Year in my books!"
Positive,ABSOLUTE MONKE CINEMA
Positive,"Very impressive, and definitely leaves a name in the history of gaming"
Positive,"Really enjoyed all aspects of this game. Graphics, scenery, music, VA, gameplay and much more. Highly recommend to others. The Scorpion King boss, hits like a truck"
Positive,best one in 2024
Positive,Shut up and take my money! I want DLC!
Positive,"Hilarious the big money reviewers scored this lower.  It's an amazing game, great levels and boss fights.  The longer I play it the better it is.  Game of the year candidate for sure."
Positive,"I have put in 100 hours into this game, beaten it once, and on the second round now. All I can say it, this game is already GOTY, graphic is stunningly good, combat is addictive, story is engaging, the variety of bosses is off the chart. 5 out of 5 stars. This will be my favorite game for a long time, possibly forever."
Positive,"I love this game everything about it is fun and entertaining, there is no politics, no political correctness and no representation of the 56000 different gender and sex identities. Just good old fashion fun and nothing more and before people moan I am a 56 year old gay man who can't be bothered with all this ""you have to represent everyone"" rubbish I'm sick of hearing it. Go talk to a mirror because nobody is listening."
Positive,"Boss fights make you rage at first but you need to trust the process, especially when you notice how powerful you become over time. After you defeat a boss once, it feels so easy and makes you feel like a badass."
Positive,Combat is peak
Positive,Accept Monke 10/10

Positive,Update as of 8/23/24:Driver update to Nvidia drivers has made the game a solid 60 fps even on high settings! Get on in boys!! Now if can actually put a map in this game cause damn for something so linear it sure is VAST in pathways.Original review: 8/19/24There is a fantastic game under all the unoptimized jank. There is no reason as to why I am clearly above the recommend spec and I'm chugging 30fps on 1080p. Just wait for the optimization it desperately needs.

Positive,OO OO AA AA!
Positive,"5 Sentence Review: 8/10This game is structured exactly like Dark Souls where you fight through peons building strength to battle larger bosses, who, to their credit, are incredibly unique and challenging in their own right. Combat is cleverly designed and, although your own move set is limited, the enemies always bring unexpected tricks and evolutions - it is very balanced. Despite having a few issues rending shadows and light particles during long cutscenes, graphics are brilliant and everything runs smooth. Designers were creative, the Chinese mythology is super interesting, and I didn't mind the grind to scale or endless attempts to best difficult enemies one bit if it meant progressing to see what the next chapter has in store. Lastly, and most importantly, this game continued to surprise me with larger areas to explore and cool new features the deeper I went which kept me entertained for at least 60 hours and is a testament to how well crafted and balanced the game is."
Positive,All hail Bajie..................................P.S. This game will have always have a special place in my heat.
Positive,"If this doesn't win GOTY, I'll be pissed. Not the biggest fan of Soul like games personally, but this one surprised me with its incredible story, well developed gameplay mechanics, well thought out motifs/themes and making each victory so worth your time, patience and training. In a mine of garbage that's the AAA video game industry, glad to see, We as players can still find a diamond every now and again"
Positive,Monkey is strong. monkey beat gods with big stick.
Positive,Oo Oo Ahh Ahh
Positive,One of the best games I have ever played.
Positive,"Story, gameplay, music, graphics... just awesome! Didin't expect to see such a good game these days anymore. I love it. Truly a masterpiece!"
Positive,I have very much enjoyed this game. The learning curve can be some what brutal but the dopamine hits when you succeed made me keep coming back.This is the first game I have 100% completed and I'm very much looking forward to the DLC that is coming out for it.Great story.Great graphics.
Positive,"Holy fuck. This game was probably the best 60 bucks I ever spent. The story, the characters, the lore. All of it was amazing, and the crazy part is I was only 15 hours in when I beat it. I still have so much (side content and side bosses). I’ve actually never felt this amazing about a game since kingdom hearts 2. When I bought the game I figured it would be another souls like combat story game since I never saw anything about the combat, BUT HOLY SHIT WAS I WRONG!!!. This games combat was insanely tuff to understand but once you get a hang of it and start learning combos, and learning how your spells work it’s so clean. And the BOSSES. The design of the bosses is amazing, and their move-set always matches their design/character and it looks beautiful, I found myself getting destroyed because I was staring at how good the design was for these guys. I won’t spoil to much, but at the end of each chapter they give you this AMAZING animation that looks so beautiful you’d think it’s something out of a movie. I played this in the dub version so there were some mouth tracking issues but the voice acting was on SPOT!. If you are thinking about this game but don’t know if it’s worth the 60, I’ll tell you right now it will probably be the best 60 you’ve spent in awhile. THEY COOKED WITH THIS GAME BRO"
Positive,"Incredible graphics, sound design, voice acting and story telling. Although the play time for a full playthrough takes ~40-50 hours depending on skill level and whether you're going for the true ending, buying the game is money well spent. The 6 environments for the 6 chapters are stunning. Each visually different from each other, with multiple levels, whole secret areas which you may not stumble upon during first playthrough, but not too open world that you do not know what to do. The sound design is incredible, every piece suits the fight and the effect sounds for the weapons etc. are very satisfying. Combat flows well with a wide array of skills and weapon effects to choose from, with some transformations requiring a lot more skill than others. The camera does get a bit jittery when facing large bosses and locked-on, but this is a problem most Souls-likes face. It is more forgiving than Souls-likes which is most pronounced in the mid to late game when you can respec into any build depending on the boss encounter. However, there are still fights that are challenging, but also graphically stunning. You could argue the true ending route has the hardest boss in-game. The only flaw is that for certain boss encounters, you start off in the middle of a phase if you have managed to beat the previous ones - this reduces some of the continuity of the fight but makes it much more approachable for casual players as they do not have to fight phase 1 etc. again. The animation pieces after each chapter is the cherry on top for the game, ranging from animation to stop motion. You really get a sense that a lot of love was poured into the game which took nearly a decade to develop. Would highly recommend picking up this game. The deluxe edition is only there to support the creators given the curios/armour set/weapon given are quickly outscaled"

Positive,Wandering Wight is my hero
Positive,"Haven't had much time to play it, but seems good so far."
Positive,"100%-ed it, great game, highly recommend it"
Positive,ooh ooh ah ah
Positive,"While the lack of polish in the combat system and haptics on the controller makes me feel not too good about the game, especially in the first half, the latter half of the game makes up for it with great spectacle and amazing fight scenes. Would I play this again? No. But did I regret experiencing this? Also no. It was a pretty good game."
Positive,"Amazing game, the side quest are amazing, some of the best I've ever seen, so good it doesn't feel like a sidequest ! the main story is also amazing.You need to be careful because their are many secrets that would probably never find without watching videos on the game, and these secrets are very very important so I would recommend watching a youtuber called ""Floverse"" he is very funny and he shows you a lot of stuff you would probably miss.One thing to keep in mind if considering to buy though, is that this game is extremely difficult and you may have to try some bosses over 15 times to beat them.Overall this game is amazing !! One of my favourite games, would definitely recommend!"
Positive,"Despite its flaws,the art design and combat system are truly outstanding and  THE LACK OF DEI  one of the most enjoyable games Ive played this year absoulte cinema Can't wait to see their next game."
Positive,One of best games ive ever played
Positive,ITS A MONKEY
Positive,being monke is fun
Positive,great game. well worth the 70$
Positive,Not very good at souls like games and usually feels more like a chore to me but this game was the perfect game for me to truly appreciate what souls like games have to offer. The bosses were amazing and I was more excited to fight a new boss than be anxious. Game has some performance issues here and there. If they had a map or compass to guide the player a little mire it would be perfect. Loved learning about Chinese mythology and even fight some of those mythical beasts in the game. The last fight has to be the coolest boss fight I ever had hands down. GOOD GAME
Positive,"Even though there are many drawbacks in this games like air walls, and little guidance. However, you cannot deny that this game represent the highest level of art in the game history!!! The animation and music are fabulous featured with Chinese characteristics. The landscapes of this game are sourced from real attractions boasted with long history. I cannot compliment it any more! The battle in the game is also fantastic too, with powers like becoming invisible the game is extremely funny and fancy. If the game has any release of DLC, I would just say ""TAKE MY MONEY!"""
Positive,"Can't stop playing. I haven't had this much fun in a single-player game in a minute. Kinda like Elden Ring and God of War had a baby. Not nearly as difficult as Elden Ring, but definitely not super easy. You have to be persistent, and keep trying. I'm an average gamer, maybe play 2-3 times a week and still enjoying it"
Positive,Probably the only game that made me wanna play more since 2021.
Positive,You won't regret.
Positive,"The game-play experience is extremely smooth, with only minor bugs and a small percentage of boss fights that are less enjoyable."
Positive,Best game ever. Please produce more game like this!
Positive,"I don't care if you don't play soulslikes.I don't care if you don't read books.Play Black Myth: Wukong NOW and experience the best elevated graphics, sounds, writing and gameplay of the year 2024.Donald Trump has just been reelected. Don't worry. Play this game and see all your troubles solve themselves.Playing this game WILL make you a better person.I want to see this studio collab with Toby Fox and see what happens in my lifetime."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is an incredible gaming experience. The game's bosses are excellently designed and present a solid challenge, making each victory feel truly rewarding. The fighting mechanics, especially with the staff, are smooth and satisfying, giving combat a unique rhythm and style. Every encounter is fun and engaging, showcasing the game's high-quality design and gameplay. Definitely a standout title that any action RPG fan should try!"
Positive,"After reading countless positive reviews online, I decided to give this game a chance. I'm completely captivated by the gameplay.This is the first souls-like game that I've truly enjoyed and didn't quit right away after a few ass-whoopings. The combat is demanding, but the satisfaction of learning enemy attack patterns and eventually defeating them is unparalleled.After I finish Black Myth: Wukong I plan to give Elden Ring another try and who knows - maybe I'll finally beat it after getting some experience in this game."
Positive,"This game blew me away! The visuals are stunning to say the least, and it's a ton of fun to play. Whether you have never played a game like this, or you've got some experience in souls-like games, this is one that you HAVE TO check out! It might just be one of the best games I’ve played in a long time. I really can’t find anything to complain about—just an all-around great experience!"
Positive,"gila sih, melebihi apapun mungkin wkwk"
Positive,First time writing a review. BMW is worth it.
Positive,Beat the game with the exaggerated swagger of a confident monkey
Positive,"Amazing game, the fighting takes some time to get used to but once you learn how to Resolute Strike/Parry this game becomes enjoyable and challenging. The story is true to Chinese mythology and it is a blast to play through. Highly recommended."
Positive,Chinese God of War.
Positive,A beautifully crafted masterpiece.
Positive,"Story, gameplay, music, graphics... just awesome! Didin't expect to see such a good game these days anymore. I love it. Truly a masterpiece!"

Positive,it is shit
Positive,"Amazing game , actually my first paid RPG ever. I don’t regret anything , gorgeous graphics , amazing story and soundtracks, and good combat system."
Positive,"Getting tired of playing the same bland, conformist, woke, money-grabbing and unfinished video games? Then this is the game for you as it is the exact opposite of all of that, definitely a GOTY material. Piqued my interest in Chinese Mythology too. Sun Wukong for life!"
Positive,Absolute Cinema Boss Fights ✋😮🤚
Positive,"I hate the serpent dude. 2 phases. Annoying. I hate him. Die. other than that, great game."
Positive,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a visually stunning action RPG that brings Chinese mythology to life, letting players experience the legend of the Monkey King, Sun Wukong. By Unreal Engine 5, the game offers incredible graphics with detailed creatures and gorgeous landscapes that set a new benchmark for visual quality. The combat is polished and engaging, blending fast, tactical action with Wukong’s unique skills like shape-shifting, stealth, and elemental magic, plus different stances that allow for a flexible playstyle. The boss fights are a real highlight, with each one bringing unique moves and challenges that make battles feel exciting and rewarding. For those looking to explore even further, optional bosses provide extra challenges and rewards, adding depth to the game. With its amazing graphics, satisfying combat, and epic boss fights, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a must-play for action RPG fans and anyone wanting a rich, myth-inspired adventure. Highly recommended!"
Positive,Monkey game good like souls yes yes very good worth the normal retail price or sale 9/10
Positive,Game is fun
Positive,"Non-souls player here!Only just started and finished the first chapter. Got stuck for about 4 hours and a half on the White-Clad Noble, but we roll!As someone who never played any souls-like games + a player who likes to turn off their brains when playing games, I was quite scared of the difficulty getting into it. Turns out, yes, it's hella hard (I reiterate, 4 1/2 hours  on a single boss in the first chapter lol), and you get your ass handed very easily. Did watch a few videos on how to beat certain bosses? Yes, but once you get into the rhythm of it (especially dodging), it gets easier, or at least, it feels like you are kind of getting somewhere. Reminds me a little bit of music or a dance when you're fighting.And while it's hard, it's very satisfying. I don't think the game is too hard. It takes patience yes, especially for a player like me, but not once did I want to quit the game. The fighting gameplay is complex and comprehensive, and you're able to tailor your fighting style for pretty much each boss.On top of that, the graphics are exceptionally good, the music is incredible, and the story, the lore.... perfect. I'd recommend reading the journal entries as you go through the game, especially after you defeat a character/boss because it gives you a lot of insights on the whole story and background/links of characters.Made the mistake of putting my game on my HDD, please just put it on your SSD, else it lags. It's quite heavy on the CPU so I'd just recommend checking the specs just to be sure. I'm running it on high settings and it's already incredible.Definitely recommend, now let's see how long it takes me to finish the actual game."
Positive,"It's a soul-like ARPG, so I'll talk about both the Action and the RPG parts.For the Action part, the combat is by itself hardcore and fun, but you can also make it more tactical (and easier) by taking advantage of the rich combinations of skills, spells, equipments, and weapons that the game offers. Whatever type of player your are, I'm sure you will find a playing mode that best suits your style.For the RPG part, the music and art are just top-tier and make the game really immersive. The story is a bit difficulty to understand, just like any other soul-like games. The storytelling is quite fragmented and non-linear. You will need to piece together information scattered across the map in order to understand the whole story, which is really deep and epic. At the end of each chapter (6 chapters in total), there is a short movie to tell the background the story. These movies are artistic too. The story is a dark adaptation of the book ""journey to the west"", one of the four most classic novels in China. Don't worry if you cannot understand the story at the beginning. Most players don't. In fact, as a Mandarin speaker who has thoroughly read the novel before, I don't understand the story either. Just look for some interpretation videos on YouTube and I find they explain the story quite well. If you are a fan of soul-like game, you probably are already familiar with this process. All in all, the game offers an epic journey for me, with fun and tactical combat, beautiful maps, engaging musics, and a fantastic story. I would highly recommend this game."
Positive,Don't personally like these types of games but I AM HOOKED
Positive,Just overall good with good writing and reference to lore. try if you want a challenging experience that also feels fun to explore and play

Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong"" is a visual masterpiece that seamlessly blends stunning graphics with engaging gameplay. The vibrant environments and detailed character designs bring Chinese mythology to life in an incredible way. The combat system is fluid and versatile, allowing for a mix of melee and magical abilities that keep battles fresh and exciting.The storytelling is immersive, rooted in the classic tale of the Monkey King, which adds depth to the gameplay experience. While I encountered a few minor bugs, the overall experience was so compelling that I barely noticed them.Overall worth the price just buy it without hesitation!!!!"
Positive,"Definitely my goty. Soundtrack and story are top notch. Animated cutscenes are my fav part, they all contain some deep critical thinking behind them, loved it loved it! Absolutely worth playing.  Super excited for DLC :)))"
Positive,"At times, it seemed very tedious because of the limitations imposed by the developers on the game... but I have enjoyed it greatly, especially the boss fights - the secret boss and final bosses... they are top tier. Give it a try if you are ever were curious of Chinese folklore as well. An amazing game! waiting for the DLC."
Positive,"Monkeh. Love wukong, glad to have a good game. Like Dark Souls you will often feel cheated. Not every dodge seems to work right, not every spell casts as expected. But that's part of the normal scuff of these games. Doesn't take away from the great story and content. Also the invisible walls are the worst part in reality. But even so, you get use to them and carry on. 9/10"
Positive,This game was soooo good. Amazing smooth combat and a kind of confusing story but I slowly understood it and everything came together. In the end this was one of the best souls like games I've ever played.Bery nice.
Positive,monkey go smack.
Positive,“Sun Wukong solos Kratos” stfu
Positive,"This game is the best soulslike ever made, even surpassing the franchise that defined the genre. There’s a myriad of enemies, bosses, and secret areas to explore, and the story is extensive. The combat is varied, offering many different weapons, spells, and combos that you can adapt to your play style. Enemy attacks feel balanced, and the difficulty scales gradually as you progress through each chapter. On top of that, the game is visually stunning, and the framerate is stable. Don’t miss out on this one!"
Positive,"An awesome dark take on the classic Wukong story! This takes place after Journey to the West, an original story from Game Science! The story, the game design, the gameplay, character designs, music…man, it’s been many years since AAA game like this shows up from nowhere and just catch you by surprise! Please get a copy and give it a try! You will not regret it! Now i do hope Game Science will set their footing and continue to work on chinese mythology game, they have got the formula right!"
Positive,Absolutely stunning! Hands down one of my favorites for 2024.
Positive,"Simply amazing. Everything about this game is just great. The true ending and everything that leads up to it is among the best experiences I've ever had in a video game. Difficult? Yes but still fair. No 2 shotting bosses, lots of room for mistakes to learn from. You will die 1-2 times per boss but you will get better fast. Tons of stuff to explore. lots of customization. tons of bosses, not just reskins. The production value is off the charts. The graphics are stunning, the music is fitting (not alway my cup of tea but still high quality) and the gameplay is nearly flawless. I even prefer it over Elden Ring, if only very slightly."
Positive,"Firstly, I must say that I have actually stopped playing games for several years now. When this game came out, I was mesmerised by the incredible graphics and the storyline. It's based on one of the 4 great Chinese classic that I grew up reading and watching on TV. I know I must get this game and went to buy a gaming laptop just for this game.The story is impressive. The graphics are remarkable. It feels like watching a movie. I'm not really a melee type of game player and I struggled much with the combat initially. There are different combination of armour and weapons along with various items, brews, spells and spirits to help you decide how you want to fight each boss. I improved as I played on and learnt so much more, and totally enjoying every boss fight. It's such an exhilarating feeling to beat a boss each time. This is one game that I have played the longest - 130+ hours and counting. I have now started NG+ and will complete at least this cycle before waiting for the DLC.I don't know about other similar type of games, but based on what this game offers, I heartily recommend it to everyone!"
Positive,A rock must be solid
Positive,awesome game. we need more games like this (single player) and enough with the AAA 10 year online service BS.
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong, where the graphics do reignA stunning display and battles a work of painThe game world's beauty, when you achieve the the gloryThe characters, so vivid, bright and mightTheir movements fluid and in sightTheir stories woven with such graceA true masterpiece, no matter in what paceIn my opinion, this game is 100% game of the year!"
Positive,very good game so far lots of things to do and explore and its skibidi cant lie
Positive,I am by no means great at this. 70 hours in and still on my first playthrough (ch 4) and I am not a soul-like fan.But this is hands down one the best 3rd person campaigns made in decades.
Positive,"This is the game of the year. It's beautiful everywhere you go - in the desert, forest, cave, dragon's lair, or on the back of a huge turtle. The story is epic with rich Chinese mythology. Diverse gameplay: different stances, upgrades, spells, transformations, items, etc. It's a lot of fun to fight bosses. You want more and more. That's why I couldn't stop until I unlocked everything, completed all the quests, and defeated all the secret bosses.Cons: sometimes you get lost in some chapters due to the lack of intuitiveness in where to go and what to do. Also, despite the plot being interesting, the delivery is often weak. I don't know if this is due to the translation or the fact that the Chinese devs do not know how to reveal the essence of the story, or maybe they make the players guess for themselves on purpose.8.5/10"
Positive,GOTY Chapter 4 was at its peak!
Positive,This is one of the best games i have ever played. the boss fights to the music to the combat style. 10/10 highly recommend
Positive,I really liked the animations after the chapters. So well animated and one of them made me even tear up!
Positive,"What a game! Initially I was worried about the difficulty but if you stick with it you can get it. I don't like souls like games, they've just never gelled with me so it made me hesitant.This game is something else entirely. It's a beautiful ode to Chinese Mythology, something refreshing and new in our already tried and true fantasy worlds.It's graphically beautiful but you will need a chunky card to get the most out of it. My 4070 super cannot quite get to the heights of the more powerful cards but it does look great.Gameplay is simple to grasp but difficult to master, there are a number of playstyles on offer and I'm sure there are many viable builds. It can be a bit hard to understand what the descriptions mean but if you try enough you'll get it. The attacks are smooth and precise, with the character reactions making you feel in control and powerful.Exporation is both risk & reward in the begining when you are not that good at the game. You have a sense of fear and rightly so because some monsters are gonna hurt you real bad.There is frustration I won't lie, you will feel a sense of unfairness in places, especially chapter 3 where you can get knocked off a ledge or edge of a cliff.But the boss fights well, it's all up to you and your current skill level. You will need to learn the bosses patterns and what works for you. Eventually you will get better at this. By the final chapters you will be dodging attacks you have never seen before and beating bosses the first time you face them.There will be times where you think to yourself, how the hell am I gonna do this and you will get angry. My advice... put the controller down. Take a break and come back.The sense of achievement for finally beating that boss is worth it and Wukong rewards you for taking the hard path. Everyone will want to get the real ending, the pay off for the final secret boss is an EPIC sequence which will have you chanting, ""Monkey! Monkey! Monkey!"" in a deep voice.This is a game that is worth taking a risk on and even though the journey has been tough for me it was one that was worth every minute. I'm a father of 2 young boys, I don't have as much time as I used to so it took me some time to finish (2 months).What a game! I 100% recommend. If this is not game of the year then it's all rigged,FYI this game came with my graphics card so technically I didn't buy it, I would have though."
Positive,"For me, two things make me fall in love with a game: a great story and fun gameplay that lets me escape reality. Black Myth: Wukong excels in both. Based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, the story is incredibly engaging, with stunning animations and well-designed characters that pull you deeper into the narrative.Created in Unreal Engine, the visuals are breathtaking, with crisp textures and detailed environments. Every frame feels like a scene from a mythological world. The cutscenes are especially impressive, like watching anime-style fights with realistic graphics.The world is gorgeous, but it's not open-world. Instead, it’s more linear, with invisible walls that sometimes break immersion. While I understand blocking access with cliffs or rocks, running into invisible barriers is frustrating. I wish the game allowed more freedom to explore.Level design is good overall, though I missed some side quests due to how levels are designed. It’s a small issue, but for players who like to catch everything in one go, it can be annoying.The gameplay is where the game truly shines. Though it borrows elements from Souls-like games, it feels more like a mix of Jedi: Fallen Order, Nioh, and God of War. The combat is smooth, fun, and evolves with new mechanics introduced throughout the game. The progression system is rewarding, letting you feel your character’s growth. The game offers a variety of spells, abilities, and nearly 80 bosses, many of which provide tough, satisfying challenges.The skill tree is balanced and well-designed, making every skill useful. Unlike other games where most skills feel pointless, here every upgrade matters. To unlock all skills, you need to reach level 342, which keeps the gameplay exciting and rewards mastery of combat.However, the game has performance issues. On my RTX 4060, certain areas and cutscenes caused frame drops. Console players have reported similar problems. Despite these technical flaws, the game is still an amazing experience.In conclusion, Black Myth: Wukong is an incredibly fun and well-crafted game with an engaging story, smooth gameplay, and breathtaking visuals. I give it a 9.8/10, losing a bit for not being open-world and for some performance issues. If you haven't played it yet, you're missing out on one of the best gaming experiences ever!"
Positive,Monkey we believe
Positive,"Really good, excited for DLC"
Positive,"It's like ""Elden Ring"" and ""God of War"" mixed together. Absolutely amazing game !"
Positive,"Good graphic, good story, not too hard or too easy.Love Bajie story.Recommend."
Positive,"This game has great graphics! The battles are fun, even when you die. The deaths are not as fast as elden ring, so you don't feel as bad when you lose. I like how it has ""perfect dodges"" to let you know you dodged perfectly, which reminds me of Zelda BOTW. It does have a bit of a slow start so if you're not used to these type of games you may not enjoy it as much."
Positive,"Beautiful, engaging, somewhat challenging, Wukong is a wonderful game worth your time. It has a similar gameplay loop to other souls-like games. One common complaint is that its a glorified button masher with no depth, and while the combat could benefit from added moves, its far from boring or repetitive. The main issues I have with the game is the silent protagonist, lack of a map and an invisible wall problem. Though these issues exist, the rest of the game far outweighs the negative presented and I highly recommend playingImportant to note that you absolutely need a strong computer to run this, I could get by on a 1650 but I do not recommend that"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a captivating action RPG that immerses players in a visually stunning world inspired by the classic novel, ""Journey to the West."" With its intricate environments, vibrant colors, and detailed character models, the game's aesthetics are truly breathtaking.The combat system offers a satisfying blend of challenge and reward. While the difficulty may initially test players, the strategic combat mechanics and satisfying combos make each encounter engaging. The bosses, in particular, present formidable challenges that will require careful planning and execution.While the game's connection to Chinese mythology may present a learning curve for those unfamiliar with the source material, the well-written story and engaging characters will keep players invested. The journal system provides valuable context and helps players understand the deeper themes and lore.One of the game's standout features is its flexible build customization. Players have the freedom to experiment with different playstyles and reassign skills without any penalties. This encourages exploration and experimentation, allowing players to tailor their experience to their preferences.While the game's performance could be optimized in certain areas, the overall experience is incredibly enjoyable. The stunning visuals, engaging combat, and rich storytelling make Black Myth: Wukong a must-play for fans of action RPGs and Chinese mythology.Rating: 9/10Pros:Stunning visuals and art styleEngaging combat systemWell-written story and charactersFlexible build customizationImmersive soundtrackCons:Minor performance issuesLearning curve for those unfamiliar with Soulslike/Soulsborne gamesLimited use of certain powerful items after game completion"
Positive,"The graphics in the game are some of the most beautiful I've seen, the sound is also top notch. I liked the idea of ​​inserting cartoons of different genres between chapters. I liked the plot, but it's not 10/10.I want to say the following, if you wanted to play a souls-like game with a clear plot and not very difficult fights, then you should definitely try the game. And so, if you are not one of them, then just try it for fun, it's worth it."
Positive,Game of the year awards will be fire this year. what a crazy good game with awesome boss fights. Each boss is unique and fun and thier designs are so good.
Positive,Monkey. Stick. Good.
Positive,"Very Soulslike, unlike the shit some people call soulslike these days this fits the OG definition. The bosses are pretty tough and you'll find yourself grinding on them to get them down, or at least I did and I do play a good deal of these types of games. Character progression feels pretty great so far, though I'm really just starting the game. There seems to be plenty of reasons to backtrack, multiple paths to take, and ways to skip bosses and still progress if you're feeling overwhelmed or under-geared.The best thing about the game, though, is the story. I'm a bit biased because I've watched The Journey to thet West tv adaptation and really enjoy The Monkey King's story. This allows me to put together some pieces that may be lost in translation. This game doesn't replay that original MK story but,, similar to LOTRO, has you follow, revisit, or augment some characters and places that The Monkey King visited in that story. It looks great, and many performance and visual issues I experienced on AMD CPU & GPU when the game launched have been resolved.This really is a MUST PLAY both for lovers of the genre and those who enjoy deep lore even if some of it is lost in translation. Especially a must play for those who have read or watched Journey to the West."
Positive,"What a distinct, thoroughly enjoyable, truly immersive experience this is.Each and every challenge is weaved with powerful lore, and the lore seeps out even in attack actions. Every single category of the game is well thought out and effortfully well done - environment, music, characters, journal, mechanics and most importantly bosses.Here comes the but. But, the players not only fight the characters - they fight performance issues, they fight input delays, and they fight pretty hardcore lack of hit boxes. And these, players cannot defeat.This journey has a powerful story, but the game is designed in a way that it will go over your head. It is designed in a way that you miss important secret missions. Important items and important missions that state dependent are not shown to the players in appropriate times. No map, no guiding wind. Story is thrown at you. And you have to be ready to catch it and understand it. But if you're ready, this is a once in a lifetime experience.The target audience for this game is someone who knows the basic themes of Buddhism, has thoroughly read Journey to the west (or its interpretations) and is prepared to read all the lore in the game. Be that audience, and this game is for you. It is truly for you."
Positive,One of the best story base game I have played. The Graphics is insaneSome cinematic are like 3D without glasses.

Positive,"Steam DeckDespite the ""unsupported"" Steam Deck compatibility tag, the game is absolutely playable! The only thing I have changed was disabling Frames Generations in Wukongs video settings. Thats it. Visuals are good, surely without any performance-hungry effects, but there are no issues, blur or freezes.Finished both endings, playing it on PC and Steam Deck 256Gb (thx cloud saves). The only difference that hit my eye were cool sand and snow effects on PC. And of course battery - Wukong drains it really quickly. Probably 1:15-1:30hrs from full to zero. But since I don't have much free time and I mostly play before going to sleep, thats more than enough."
Positive,"Black Myth is what a game should be!I've never been a big fans of souls games because of how aimless the open world concept is, but Wukong is different. The game has souls like elements while still providing a linear yet very challenging gaming experience. You play as Wukong after the events of The Journey to the west and immediately the cinematics do not disappoint. Every chapter (level) offers a different experience on story telling both prologue and epilogue of the chapter. The game is best played in chinese dub with english subtitles as the chinese dub really showcases the amount of love given to the monkey king world. Additionally each level has several sub quests in addition to the main story questline which gives players the chance to explore and discover secret bosses and challenges. These extra side bosses and questlines rewards players with a ton of items/powerups that make the rest of the story easier.For the post game, you enter new game+ which offers enemies with higher dmg and health, however players keep all their items except for key story items and teleport (shrine) points. Upon completion of each chapter players get to further boost their stats and become very OP. Overall this is a game that delivers on what it promises without any paid subscriptions or pay to win features."
Positive,The legendary monke is in this game
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is seriously turning heads and setting new records in the gaming world! Developed by Game Science Studio, this game has become one of the most hyped titles, and for good reason. It’s got a jaw-dropping budget of over $75 million, which is a huge deal, and it's taking a unique approach by weaving in elements of Chinese mythology with some really innovative gameplay​GAMEPRESSURE.COM.Now, if you're worried that this game falls into the typical Souls-like category, don’t sweat it. While it does have some tough boss battles and requires a bit of strategy, it doesn’t stick to the grind that some of those games have. It offers a more balanced experience, making it perfect for those of us who find the hardcore Souls games a bit intimidating​THE REVIEW GEEK.The combat system is where it really shines! It’s fluid and lets you mix and match skills, magical items, and even some stealth tactics. This makes it way more interesting than just your standard hack-and-slash game. You can choose how you want to approach battles—whether you want to charge in headfirst or take a sneakier route​GAMEPRESSURE.COM.What’s really exciting about Black Myth: Wukong is how it shows that gaming is definitely not dead. With all the talk about the industry going stale, this game slaps that idea right in the face! It’s proof that there’s still plenty of room for creativity and fresh ideas, especially coming from Eastern developers. Unlike some Western studios that seem scared to take risks and instead add boring elements just to keep everyone happy, Black Myth stays true to its vision, and it pays off big time.It’s refreshing to see a game that embraces its cultural roots without watering anything down. Black Myth: Wukong is a bold statement about what gaming can be, and it’s really captivating with how it brings Chinese mythology to life.aside fromThe fandom is downbad for the 4th Sister, Spiderladies, and most importantly, Zhu Bajie! we're good...In short, Black Myth: Wukong isn’t just another action RPG; it’s a game that pushes boundaries. Whether you're a hardcore fan of Souls-like games or someone just looking for a fun challenge, this game has something for everyone. It’s a massive win for Eastern developers, setting a high bar that Western studios should pay attention to. If you thought gaming was on the decline, think again—Black Myth is here to show us just how high the bar can be set!"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is by far my favorite game I've played this year. There are so many things to gush about that I'm a bit scared to begin writing this because I don't know when I'll end. I guess I'll just start talking then. BM: Wukong is not a perfect game by any means, it has its faults and issues. Though those issues can be gleamed over due to the insane amount of good this game does. Wukong is beyond fun. I'm one of the people who loves the souls games and enjoys challenging experiences. Wukong delivers on this front in ways that From Software wishes they could. Almost every boss is a memorable hit towards a fantastic experience. Enemies themselves are fun to fight and I never felt like any were tedious to encounter. Even the things people complained about were fun. I really, really enjoyed my playthrough. This review is being written after my 100% achievement run of Wukong so I've experienced everything it has to offer. And I can say with 100% certainty that this game didn't fumble the completionist aspect of games. The most tedious thing is that some quests can be missed and some items are rare drops behind real time re-spawns. This can be worked around but is still very annoying when you're hit by it. Regardless, I never felt like I was at a disadvantage for deciding to 100% Wukong. I felt very encouraged to continue which is all I could ever ask for. The thing that shines the most about Wukong is its combat. Exploration is also insanely fun, but none of that would be complete without the combat. Everything is so fluid an rewarding. I never felt like any staff stance was useless or less viable than the others. There are a lot of options to tackle Wukong with different play styles. If something doesn't work for you then you can always experiment without needing to spend a rare resource or re-grind for levels. Your money isn't lost on death and the only thing you have to worry about is using things at the proper time. This makes Wukong balanced towards skill. If you are able to master what it gives you, then you will succeed on your journey. Wukong is a beautiful game. Graphically it is outstanding, but its story is even more so. There are many messages to learn and connections to make. I felt like I learned a lot about who Wukong himself was along my way and what this world I was traversing was. It's explained in both direct and indirect ways in such a way that you only miss out if you truly don't pay any attention. Along with the great graphics, come great performance issues. This is the part of the review where I delve into some of the game's issues so bear with me here. I encountered a lot of stuttering and freezing issues. The sheer amount of lag that some spells and bosses created was insane. I had to mod the game to fix these issues which is embarrassing. Though, I will mention, the game was not unplayable as a result of my performance problems. I didn't mod it until my new game plus run. I beat the full game, secrets and all, with full performance issues in play. That should tell you all you need to know about how bad these issues were. They still shouldn't have been present, but not being game ruining is great to see considering other games and their similar problems. Another issue I found, and one that may be a personal nit pick, is that the game seems to focus too much on it's looks. I say this as some enemies and bosses have unclear AOE or attack hitboxes as they blend too well with the surroundings. Usually air or force attacks do this. I do have moderate light sensitivity so it is harder for me to see these. I did run this by some other friends and a couple agreed that they were a bit rough to see. Other issues with move sets are hard to predict or react to grabs. I won't really knock the game for this because it's a skill issue, but there was one that I really think was totally unfair. All in all, Wukong is a short but sweet game. If you delve into everything then expect a long 40 or more hour playthrough. If not, then you can easily get through the game in 12 hours or less depending on your experience with games like this. It's an incredibly polished experience and I will say it's a don't miss this kind of experience. Some final notes. I heavily disagree with this being labeled as a souls-like. There are some things here and there that Wukong shares with the souls games, but this was a wholly different experience to those kinds of games. I've seen souls fans come to this game thinking they are similar and complaining about difficulty because they try to play Wukong like Dark Souls. I blame those who do this mostly, but I also blame the labeling. That's a me thing though so feel free to disagree."
Positive,"The world is very linear, and there are lots of invisible walls that ruin immersion when you run into them. Other than that, the story is good, the graphics are absolutely spectacular, and the combat is extremely satisfying. I would highly recommend it."
Positive,"This. Game. Is. Phenomenal.(I'm not going to say how good the game is, you got reviewers saying the same ol thing)If only I have the patience to hone my skills and find every single corner of the map for secrets it would take me a lot more hours on this game. (I modded the game to make it easier)Now that I have finished the game, I just wish there is free roam so I can cloud around and explore."
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong is once every ten years or so game where everything just oozes polish and style. From the cutting edge graphics to the massive storyline of Journey To The West , it offers solid action albeit repetitive combat. A must play for modern god of war fans and similar genre lovers. 9/10PS: MONKE 🙈🙉🙊🐵"
Positive,Historia interesante y buena jugabilidad
Positive,"Very great game. The story is a bit hard to understand since some parts seem to rely on prior knowledge of the journey to the west. But, I think it's clear enough to be enjoyable on its own. As for the gameplay, for people that have some experience with this type of game might need some time to get used to the combat system as it is a little bit different to other games, especially on the way combos and heavy attacks work.Then, the final thing I would like to give the most props to, the cutscenes. I think the cutscenes you get at the end of every chapter is simply the best. I don't think I've ever seen cutscenes that are that memorable in the past 10 years."
Positive,monkey with stick goes bonk
Positive,SHOULD BE GAME OF THE YEAR
Positive,this game is good
Positive,great graphics smooth game play. story could use a little more detail and explaining. would be nice to have quests and a little guidance. a missed a few things because there is no map which also caused me to explore areas multiple times making sure I got everything. overall very enjoyable and challenging game
Positive,"on chapter 4, this game is ez mode if you have above speed limit IQ"
Positive,"This is the most beautiful looking game I have ever seen.It's visually stunning and it really comes to life through gorgeous animations of environments, surroundings and models.The gameplay however let me down. Especially the combat. Because while it is fun to be Wukong and play around with the staff, I feel that there is so much more they could have done with this.Movement / CombatThe dodge / perfect dodge mechanic is awesome.The light attack has 1 combo.. That's fine but the fact that you can't combo into something else with it makes it feel boring after a while. Sure you have the see through attack from ability tree and the upgrades for it but is that really it ? I feel there is so much lost potential here..For example: Light attack mid air gives you specific stomp on head attack and then you flip back off. The move is okay. That you can combo it into a heavy attack is cool. However it sucks that it's not its own thing, because it takes away the ability to jump and start attacking normally.The game really feels like It's lacking interesting experimentation with inputs. Like X, square, triangle, circle combinations that you see in action games / fighting games. Only 1 attack for light and another for heavy is surprising and disappointing.Yes stances but they feel limited too. The pole stance doesn't even protect you from attacks below, how and why ? That is just dumb.Then you have the thrust stance, which is kinda fun but again limited.Focus points are fun but what are really the options ? So few.. Also the fact that you have 4 points in the intro fight and you don't in the game EVEN THOUGH in ability tree you can literally unlock 4th focus point and it STILL DOESN'T SHOW UP. Wtf devs ?!Weapon types1 weapon type is basically what you have to play around with through out the whole game! Not even a sword for variety without transforming into another enemy that is somehow capable of using it while Wukong isn't ? So dumb..You defeat a boss and before you now stands a new shiny and interesting weapon that is simply waiting for you to pick it up and become it's new rightful owner. So into the ear storage it goes. Yet, even though it is now clearly under your possession you can't access it outside of a transformation ?!Spirits and transformationsI think the spirits are mostly bad and the fact that you only get 1 attack before you have to wait for what feels like an eternity to use them again, further strengthens my feeling of being limited by the game instead of encouraged to have fun and go nuts.I wish you instead could use any weapon an enemy was carrying (obviously after defeating it). For the bigger/more significant enemies and bosses, those I wish would get added into your transformation pool just like it is with a select few in the game. That way the encounters with enemies would have way more meaning and reward, beyond the idea of increasing will and hopefully getting a good drop. Also the silliness of using 1 attack with a spirit (that might even miss) wouldn't be a factor, as you could instead control them freely for a short period like the others.GameplayThe lengthiness of the game is unfortunately accompanied by too limited combat variety.At least to keep it fresh and interesting for me. I get that the staff has huge importance to the idea of Wukong but no matter how many staffs you put into the game, it doesn't make it any less boring once you reach say Chapter 3.. I would think that for many players the thirst for a different weapon should have set in by then and the fact that the game doesn't satisfy that desire is a huge let down!I do like the combat, It just leaves me wanting so much more and instead of having lots of fun doings lots of different cool things.. I'm left thinking: Is this really it ?!You might say, well what's the point of the transformations then ? The characters you transform into obviously have different moves than Wukong, so it comes down to player preference.It's just too much waiting for access to cool things, instead of having access to cool things more frequent that really turns me off. Especially knowing how long some of the chapters are that they are filled to the rims with enemies.Chapter ends give you items that were suited for that chapterAfter you have completed certain chapters, you are given an item that would have been perfect for that chapter which you just completed ?! This feels so counter intuitive to the gameplay and the only way I can see why they would do this, is for multiple play-throughs. However that would deprive those who only play the game once from it and that doesn't seem good to me. Yes you should be rewarded for multiple plays through a game but the timing of when you receive these items in the game is just weird and feels out of order.Spellcasting failsWhen you cast a spell and for some reason it gets snuffed out ? BUT it actually fully depletes your bar for it so you have to wait for it to charge up again even though you didn't get to use its ability ?! Wtf That is just mega dumb and so bad. From what I can tell, this happens if you are hit while being MID ANIMATION of casting a spell. I have lost count of how many times my spells simply haven't come out due to pretty much unknown reasons and that shouldn't be happening.Enemy damage and stagger statesMaybe it's just me but I feel that enemies do more damage than they should. You shouldn't lose half your health out of nowhere. Especially from how mythical Wukong is made out to be. He is not your average monkey and so how often he has to take a sip of the gourd kind of paints him in a totally different light and makes him look and feel much weaker than he should be portrayed. There is also a really annoying stun lock state that I wish wasn't there.Invisible walls / FallingI wish areas that look reachable actually were and not locked behind invisible walls. Too many times my exploration desires have been met with a sudden access denied. Simply put about falling: If you can't jump off somewhere, an enemy shouldn't be able to push you off it.The prison....What is up with the state you suddenly out of nowhere find yourself in where you start losing life from simply existing ? It also persists through death into your respawn but only sometimes ?!No mapLack of directionIf you can't know whether you are doing a side quest or following the story path, I feel that the game has let you down in not offering you the choice of what you want to pursue.Can't change key binds..ConclusionSo I don't think this is a masterpiece but it goes to show what can be done if developers are given enough time to create what they want and release it when they are satisfied. Which should be the norm as it eliminates time pressure and instead lets devs put all their focus into their creation. Lots of praise to them for all the work, true passion, love, heart and soul that they put into this epic game!Hopefully it will serve as a phenomenal foundation for Game Science to build this universe upon. Because I can't see how they would just kill it now, after the immense hype and interest that it has managed to garner across the globe. The fact that so many people are loving it, should only reinforce their already burning desire to share more of this overall wonderful experience that playing Black Myth Wukong really is.PROS+ Visuals+ Animations+ The dodge / Perfect dodge mechanic+ Music+ Soundscapes+ Story+ Character designs+ Cool armor+ Voice acting+ Bosses+ Overall feel+ SecretsCONS- Repetitive/Limited combat- No weapon variation- Bad rewards for certain things- Too many enemies / Enemy damage / Annoying stun lock state- Failed spellcasting- Insignificant item ""buffs""- No key-bindingIf this had more varied combat or more weapons than just a staff, I would give this a 10/10.From becoming boring instead of flourishing, it gets an 8/10."
Positive,A monkey reaps what he sows
Positive,UUU U U A A U U U AA
Positive,"Remember when games were sold complete? No DLC scheduled for a calendar year or season passes or online required or microtransactions or making an account for the developers miniplatform? Those days? This game takes me back to then, and is a great game as well."
Positive,"I'm not yet done with this title as of the time of this review - but I cannot wait any longer.  This HAS to be 2024 Game of the Year.It took little time for this world and this game to completely blow me away, and then I had to start expecting that they would try to do it again - and then they successfully did, again.  And again, and AGAIN.Buy this game at full price, and tattoo it onto your body.  Black Myth: Wukong plays like somebody's life work, and they nailed every inch of it."
Positive,"Took me a while to finish this but I have finally finished this incredible game, Game Science promised a lot and delivered it to its absolute.Story: Just like Elden Ring or any other soulsborn this game’s story is convoluted and intricate, you have to work for the story to understand and read the lore and maybe watch a YouTube video, but the story is fascinating and grandeur. There are plenty of NPCs in the game that continue the story of the game, it’s based on a novel Journey to the West and is full of mythical creatures of all sorts, I had tons of fun reading and exploring about those creatures. Combat: The combat in this game is nothing short of perfection, it’s fluid, quick, responsive and solid. There are multiples techniques for you to use with combos and transformations that let you transform into different creatures that you’ve bested previously. This game has one of the best combat’s I’ve experienced. The best part of the game is the 80+ boss battles which are spectacular to view, hard to fight and a pure satisfaction to beat. Exploration: in extremely rewarding there are so many hidden areas and boss encounters that you will go out of your way to explore every corner. The game’s environment is loaded with hidden treasures, loot and new NPCs. From lush forests to ancient ruins, the realm of Black Myth Wukong is surely a magnificent place to explore, brimming with life and intrigue. Graphics: in Black Myth Wukong are certainly a treat to behold. The magnificent visuals bring the game's environment to life in spectacular detail. From the character design to the surroundings, every part of the game's visuals is a monument to the developers' passion to their craft. Black Myth Wukong is a visual feast that demonstrates the full capabilities of current gaming visuals. Overall, Black Myth Wukong is a masterpiece in game design, a gripping story, absolutely incredible combat, wondrous exploration, and gorgeous graphics. It is a must-play experience that sets a new benchmark for gaming quality. I offer Black Myth Wukong a well-deserved rating of 9.5 out of 10."
Positive,"Alittle ez but thats cause im used to these types of ""Get-Gud"" ""Skill issue"" games, with that said this is easily one of the greatest game iv ever played and released.if you arnt a shit gamer, you absolutely need to get this!. +++ I LOVE chinese mythology and Journey To The West. (This is also a final type continuance of the Journey To The West story)"
Positive,"**Black Myth: Wukong – Review****Pros:**""Black Myth: Wukong"" marks Game Science's debut into AAA gaming, and what a stunning entry it is! The game is visually breathtaking, with its gorgeous environments and detailed character designs. The combat system is exhilarating, though it can be quite challenging for newcomers. It rewards patience and precision, and the sense of satisfaction you get from perfectly dodging an enemy's attacks is unmatched. Even though there is no parry mechanic, the dodge system feels unique and highly effective, making every battle feel strategic and intense. the sound design deserves special praise as well. From the clash of weapons to the ambient noises of the world, every sound feels meticulously crafted to pull you deeper into the experience. Enemies in the game are diverse, keeping the combat fresh, and the boss fights are particularly notable for their creativity and uniqueness. one standout aspect is the anime-style storytelling that unfolds at the end of each chapter. These moments add a distinct artistic flair to the game, giving it a touch of originality in terms of narrative presentation.**Cons:**That said, the game isn’t without its flaws. Chapter 6, in particular, feels like a bit of a slog. The large map offers little in terms of exploration, and the pacing drags down the excitement that the earlier parts of the game build up. Additionally, Wukong as a character feels a bit too silent and emotionally distant. You never really connect with him on a deeper level, which can make the experience feel more like you're mindlessly fighting bosses rather than investing in the story of the protagonist.**Conclusion:**Despite these few shortcomings, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is an amazing game, and for me, it's one of the best of 2024. I completed the game 100%, which took around 80+ hours, and the journey was absolutely worth it. If you're a fan of God of War or hack-and-slash combat systems, I highly recommend giving this game a try. Game Science has crafted something truly special, and I’m excited to see where they take their talents next."
Positive,"reject humanity, return to monke10/10,recommend it"
Positive,best game of 2024. Hands down.
Positive,"Best lastig spel, maar een opgever wint nooit en een winnaar geeft nooit op."
Positive,"The combat feels fluid, combining fast-paced melee action with spellcasting and Wukong's unique abilities. The game's difficulty is challenging but rewarding, reminiscent of Souls-like titles"
Positive,Monke & bonk stick. Highly recommended.
Positive,"Beautiful game. The souls influence is there, but they didn't follow the formula to the letter, which gives this game its own flair. Beautiful graphics, very satisfying and diverse combat system, wonderful inspiration from Chinese mythology and folklore. The fact that they tried to base the fighting abilities on the actual mythology is magnificent."
Positive,"Fazia um bom tempo que eu não jogava um jogo que me fazia pensar nele por 24hrs. O jogo é lindo, cada cenário passando pelas estações do tempo, cenários secretos, historias de capítulos que tem sua conclusão em sidequest, o carinho que os devs colocaram nas conclusões de cada cenário é de bater palmas, você fica incrédulo de tão bom que é jogar e saber mais sobre as coisas do mundo. Finalizei o jogo sem ser humilhado (petrificar e pegar meu porongo), mas no NG+ e NG++ fui humilhado e sempre ficava com o sorriso no rosto. Erlang foi o boss que eu mais morri, fiquei frustrado, mas consegui passar. O capitulo 4 para mim é o mais lindo e aquela historia é o beijo do chef.Platinar esse jogo não foi cansativo, foi divertido, deveria ter platinado no NG+ (sou curioso e ficava vasculhando os locais), quando terminei a primeira run so faltou 10 conquistas, no NG+ por burrice minha esqueci de pegar um bau importante, mas mesmo assim, no NG++ é onde fica com mais dano os mobs, e começa a ser desafiador de novo, e fui me aventurar mais uma vez e platinei.  Sinto que não tem mais nada, vazio, vou ter que  tocar na grama? Como um um amigo aqui da steam falou:''Valeu cada centavo''.English:It's been a long time since I played a game that made me think about it for 24 hours.The game is beautiful, each scenario goes through the seasons of time, secret scenarios, chapter stories that end in sidequests, the care that the devs put into the conclusions of each scenario is applause-worthy, you're in disbelief at how good it is to play and learn more about the things in the world.I finished the game without being humiliated (petrified and taking my gourd), but in NG+ and NG++ I was humiliated and always had a smile on my face. Erlang was the boss I died the most, I was frustrated, but I managed to get through. Chapter 4 is the most beautiful for me and that story is the chef's kiss.Platinuming this game wasn't tiring, it was fun, I should have platinumed it in NG+ (I'm curious and I kept searching the places), when I finished the first run I only had 10 achievements left, in NG+ I was stupid and forgot to get an important chest, but even so, in NG++ is where the mobs deal more damage, and it starts to be challenging again, so I went on an adventure once more and platinumed it. I feel like there's nothing left, empty, will I have to touch the grass?As a friend here on Steam said:''It was worth every penny''."
Positive,A great experience!
Positive,"very good game for my 19 hours playing, the first boss is kinda hard, but the rest is ok."
Positive,Really fun game but i sort of stopped playing it cuz i got on elden ring again lol
Positive,"Took me some time to think up what i wanted to say about this game but all in all this was a very fun experience and makes me very excited for what other studios in china produce.. Im looking at YOU Phantom blade zero.With its ARPG approach with certain souls elements it was a fun ride to go through, I was going into this game expecting it to just be like any standard souls-like but it doesn't quite hit that nail on the head to fit into it other than the generic archetypes that you find in that genre.From start to beginning the quality of each boss fight was widely engaging and had me wondering what each one would end up being like the further i got into the game, especially with the variety that comes from all bosses than it being simply a large human with a sword.I do wish there was more engagement from the cast throughout the game, shoutout to Zhu Bajie my absolute GOAT of the entire story and his arc that you have with the spider ladies. For once in that entire story the Spider arc & connection for Zhu baije was genuinely the best part of the game story wise.. i would be telling a lie if i said it didn't get me emotional.Overall this game does a great job at making a fun ARPG with an interesting fighting loop until you've essentially mastered it.. to slowly get bored of it towards the very end. The animations between each chapter and the secret ending wrapped up this game perfectly for me.Once again, i love you zhu bajie"
Positive,"Completely worth the money, great gameplay, great bosses, great story-telling and just an amazing game all around."
Positive,"Genuinely the best game I've played in such a long time, nothing bad to say, EVERYONE should play this game."
Positive,good boss battles and character designs
Positive,"the best game of all time, if this doesnt win goty......"
Positive,"Beautiful game,  where you mostly fight bosses. Great fights, great visuals, great mechanics.Im on the older side, so I really like it, that I can just open the game in the evening and fight one boss.No need to prepare for hours or farm stuff.The fights are mostly very fair, and it feels like Im learning waht I have to do autmatically.Im having a ton of fun and I recommended it to my friends. :)"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is nothing short of a masterpiece!The combat system is dynamic, allowing for a wide range of staff combat styles that feel very interactive, no matter which one you choose.The graphics are incredible, along with the boss design and fighting mechanics.Performance on PC is great, with smooth FPS and very few bugs (on a high-spec PC).There are enemies and unlocks that you will be unable to access once you progress too far, but if you're a completionist, I recommend doing some research or going into New Game+ to unlock everything.Overall, I’d highly recommend Black Myth: Wukong. Take your time with it and explore everything.And finally... Praise Monke!"
Positive,It was awesome. Very accurate representative of the legend of the Sun Wukong. I highly recommend it.
Positive,ABSOLUTE CINEMA OF A GAME!
Positive,10/10 - Masterpiece (must play for all gamers)
Positive,woooong ching man
Positive,"never played soul game before. So, learning curve was steep for me at first. Once you know  how to fight, it's pretty fun to play. Don't have to mention much about other aspects like story, graphic and characters as it's all perfect."
Positive,"The game itself might, keyword MIGHT, not seem that good at the beginning but trust me when it gets good, it gets REALLY GOOD. Finding secrets which reward you with better items and gear along with some interesting story, fun areas where theres always something to find around every corner, and some very well designed armors and staffs. I'd say this game deserves to win GOTY."
Positive,"9/10 if you like Souls-style dodge-dodge-dodge-hit style combat, 8/10 otherwise. The combat is slightly faster paced than tradition Dark Souls but not quite to the point of pure button smashing, and some bosses give sufficient challenge. Note: there is no difficulty slider so if you are bad at souls combat, you might face a few walls. Build variety is marginal but there are few different abilities to choose from and tricks to learn if you want to get good, but you don't really need to learn any combos to beat the game.Graphics: Decent on regular monitors, surprisingly bad on HDR capable monitors. The game has weird dark grey fog filling all dark places and corners that clears up as you walk near, which is very jarring on displays with good black levels. The game intentionally makes you half-blind in dark places for no reason and negates any advantage of having an OLED display. Regular displays are less affected because they cannot portray dark areas properly anyway.Story: Simple and functional, few annoying cases where the player is defeated in a cutscene but overall works very well for a game like this where gameplay is the focus. Leans a bit into lore, but not so much that you would need to read the journey to the west. Characters are good, even the sidekick is a rare case for not being annoying and useless and has some touching moments.The game earns a lot of style points. Lots of art and optional lore to be read, and the chapter ending cutscenes are especially cool. The game is very trimmed in a good way: no babbling comedy characters, no useless dialog (main character does not talk, which is the best thing ever), no stupid monetization attempts, no grind (unless you really want to), no pure cosmetics. The game does not even have a map, which actually makes exploration much more enjoyable, and the main route is simple enough to follow that you won't get lost in the semi-open world. However, you will likely need to check guides to get every secret boss fight. In short, Black Myth Wukong is an old fashioned game in every good sense. Technically not very original, but the foundation is solid and the setting is fresh since Chinese mythology has been rarely explored in videogames."
Positive,"I finally finished it and it certainly lived up to all the hype, it is a fantastic game with a few small but noticeable problems. But considering how huge this game is it's so impressive how well it's made, they obviously cared about this game while making it and showed what a group of people with passion and skill can make together. This game is a glimpse of hope in a sea of just horrifically bad triple A games that we have been plagued with recently and I hope this proves to those companies that fans want high quality games, not regurgitated trash every year."
Positive,game of the year
Positive,"After 2 months with 40+ hours of gameplay, I was finally able to finish this game.9/10. This is the best game I played this year.I just hope there was more explanation about the lore though."
Positive,"Very good story, well made and good controls, is a blast"
Positive,"AMAZING! the lore, game-play, visuals, soundtrack. Everything was perfect to the last moment. The secret areas and the secret ending is chef's kiss. Exceeded all my expectations for a first game from a new studio."
Positive,"This game is sick. From animation to physics and movements of the character. The game science have done a great job. It has bought the gaming community to the new and exciting challenges. if you didn't played this game, you are missing out a gem."
Positive,"A truly awesome game and an amazing first project from a studio. And from China as well, so that gets bonus pride points from me.Amazing unique setting that draws on Journey to the West, fluid combat, varied and complex skill and gear system that allows for different builds, and lots, LOTS of bosses to fight. Mechanically, the game is very clearly inspired by Souls games and other action games like God of War, and it's equally satisfying to play.The story is good, but a bit too cryptic to understand. Unlike fromsoft games, where its esoteric feel of the setting contributes to the game's atmosphere and invites poetic interpretation, Black Myth's setting is based on a very defined Chinese Mythical setting with a lot of established backstories, and I think the game could have benefited from explaining some more instead of just throwing everything into the in-game wiki menu.One major complaint I have is invisible walls, there's way too many and since this game hides a lot of secrets in its levels, I often had to bump everywhere just to check if I can go there or its just another invisible wall, which is pretty frustrating. Another complaint I have is a bit personal: most bosses felt too easy to me, I feel like I only need to learn the moveset of like 5 or so bosses to beat them and the rest can often be brute forced by just mashing dodge when enemies are attacking and throwing every skill at them when their cool-downs are over.Overall a pretty great game. Here's to more projects like this from China in the future!"
Positive,"I would highly recommend to play this game, This game's animations and the graphics is ridiculous, the story is even more insane, This is one of the hardest game i have ever played in my life, and I would challenge people to finish this game it is not recommended for weak willed individuals because you need a lot of patience to finish the game. At first i was pissed at the game for how hard the bosses were and stopped playing it entirely, but after a day or two i tried it once more and got better results than before, This game improves your combat capabilities, However the only frustrating thing about the game are its achievements you have to play the game multiple times to get all the achievements, other than this minor setback. If you are a hardcore gamer I highly recommend you play this game."
Positive,"This is my first review, I completed sekiro shadow die twice ng+ in my ps4 before playing this game. So it was kinda easy for me but if they give more window for perfect dodge this game could have been more enjoyable like sekiro, god of war combat system. Because most enemies starts their attack animation slower and ends it faster, so sometimes I'll just spam the dodge button, that time it's hard to get perfect dodge. Other than that this game combat and upgrade systems are awesome and good story line with amazing anime style cut scenes at the end of each chapter and secret story and boss fights. I enjoyed this game very much. Thanks for this awesome game."
Positive,It was perfect down to the last minute detail.
Positive,"""Wukong does not need GOTY to prove its quality; while TGA needs Wukong to prove its credibility."""
Positive,"You wont regret buying this game. Such a masterpiece visually and the story is done so well. Runs well on Steam Deck with moderate graphics I was hitting 40fps last night while playing for a bit, I was a happy camper"
Positive,M O N K E Y
Positive,"7/10pro: good combat system, good graphics, and above all, really great art direction.con:The level design for me is a disaster.Invisible walls, completely misleading paths, save points scattered randomly – overall, more annoying than enjoyable...I quit after the 3rd chapter because by the end I was just bored, and everything felt the same. Boss fight -> 5 completely weak enemies -> mini-boss fight -> 3 completely weak enemies -> 20 minutes searching for where I haven’t been yet because, of course, there’s no map -> boss fight..."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong é uma experiência inovadora no mundo dos jogos de ação. O que mais chama a atenção é a maneira como ele traz elementos de jogos soulslike, mas sem se render completamente a essa fórmula já conhecida. A gameplay é fluida, estratégica e ao mesmo tempo oferece uma liberdade que vai além do que se costuma ver nesse gênero.O combate é intenso, exigindo habilidade e precisão, mas a variedade de movimentos e as habilidades do protagonista, inspiradas na lenda do Rei Macaco, dão uma nova dinâmica à jogabilidade. O jogador não fica restrito apenas a esquivas e ataques convencionais, há toda uma gama de opções para adaptar o estilo de luta conforme a necessidade, o que torna o combate mais dinâmico e menos previsível.Os elementos visuais são outro ponto forte. O jogo apresenta um mundo belamente construído, inspirado na mitologia chinesa, com cenários impressionantes e criaturas que misturam o épico e o sobrenatural. Cada ambiente tem uma riqueza de detalhes que faz você querer explorar e descobrir mais sobre esse universo fantástico. A atmosfera é complementada por uma trilha sonora que captura perfeitamente o clima das batalhas e momentos de exploração.O grande diferencial de Black Myth: Wukong é que, mesmo incorporando aspectos que lembram os soulslike, ele não se limita a seguir esse caminho à risca. A dificuldade e os desafios estão presentes, mas de uma forma que se sente mais orgânica e menos punitiva, permitindo que o jogador se envolva na história e nas mecânicas sem sentir que está apenas repetindo fórmulas antigas.No geral, Black Myth: Wukong entrega uma experiência refrescante, misturando o melhor de um jogo desafiador com a inovação necessária para não parecer mais do mesmo. É um título que vai agradar tanto aos fãs de jogos mais exigentes quanto àqueles que buscam algo épico e diferente."

Positive,very immersive graphics and gameplay but if you are a elden ring lover then this game is not an open world there is always an invisible boundary that blocks and paths are fixed. Although chapter 6 lets you roam free but the map for chapter 6 is so small that you can cover it all in 1 minute with nimbus.
Positive,I am the monke
Positive,Immersive experience. Expansive backstory. Stunning graphics. Truly a game worth playing!
Positive,i love it my favorite game for 2024 it captures a lot of different game play styles
Positive,I enjoyed this game so much more than i thought i would. I run a gtx 1080 ti 8gb and i still had 50-60 fps on medium graphics.
Positive,"Enjoyed this game quite a lot and would recommend, although at times it would really grind my gears. I've played maybe 2 hours of a souls/souls-like game before, and although many say its not similar to those games, I'd say the premise is sorta there in terms of the boss fights. This game I'd say is great as an intro to those sort of games, now I've completed this I will go on to play those games!Some things that really annoyed me at times were:- The combat can at times feel janky; especially the dodging and item using. Sometimes it just wouldn't happen after numerous attempts. Some bosses had really dumb hit boxes or lack thereof.- I think I used the Thrust stance once throughout the whole game, and Pillar was only used once I gained a certain weapon that utilises that stance. If not for that, I'd have used Smash stance solely, the other 2 just didn't appeal too much to bother using them.- Mouth flaps are not synced for dubbed versions, small issue but annoying. And I don't get why the main character has no dialogue whatsoever, even just one or two lines here and there would suffice. Hard to make any connection with the character for this reason.- Some side quests and secrets and the odd main story objectives were just too obscure to complete without having to search a guide online. I really hate having to resort to this shit, I'm not Sherlock Holmes.- Some bosses are unavailable once you get to certain points in the game, some of these are optional ones you might not come across. I completed the main game and wanted to go back and defeat any bosses I'd missed. Unfortunately this again resorted to online guides for locations, I got to one and there was no boss. I found out later that you had to defeat it before getting to a certain point. Why is this even a thing, it's for a very few number of them throughout the game and there's just no reason for it. I immediately uninstalled at this point because 100% completion was made unattainable.- I'm running a fairly decent rig with a Ryzen 9 5900X & 3080 yet I was getting on average 40-60 FPS with recommended settings. And I've definitely played better looking games in the past with much higher FPS e.g. RDR2. It was playable after making some setting changes and still looked pretty but in some areas I suffered with lower than ideal FPS, poor optimisation I imagine?It's easy to point out the bad things, but I would still recommend this game 100% if you want a linear combat focused game with a multitude of bosses, some with a considerable challenge to overcome!"
Positive,Game of the year 10/10.
Positive,"A masterpiece of a game in what it achieves with it's visuals and storytelling. The gourd moment (if you know, you know) was one of many moments that will make this game unforgettable to me."

Positive,2024 GOTYTY Western devs should learn from this
Positive,"Absolute CINEMA. You want to finally do something more than just an incredibly dull slash? This game is for you. Peak combat, peak visuals, peak story. Just incredible!"
Positive,Monkey go hard
Positive,"I think this game is a 6/10 on a bad day and a 7/10 on a good one. The game looks great visually and ran smooth for me. I maybe had one instance of crashing or freezing, but the performance was up there. There was some stuttering toward the final boss due to all the extra particles. However the game may look TOO good because it is riddled with invisible walls and dead ends that lead to nothing but a waste of time. The combat is fair, you can not button mash your way to victory. It can't be compared to a souls-like game so expect a completely different play style to approach enemies and bosses. Once you get used to that throw it out of the window whenever you face a new boss. The game gives you access to cool abilities and they work on weaker enemies fine, but the bosses adhere to their own agenda and will ignore all sense of the game. For all the stories I've heard about Wukong and how incredibly powerful he is, I never felt unstoppable during any boss fight. If you are up for challenging fights and interested in the lore of Wukong I think it is right for that, but difficulty of this game is not for casual players."
Positive,It's just really good
Positive,"Cool gameplay, unprecedented graphics and vibes. The first four out 6 maps are carefully curated, though you feel the rush out of the last two especially the very last one."
Positive,monkey staff bonk bonk
Positive,"Great Game, Game of the year 2024 incoming"
Positive,"I've been waiting for years for this game release and it's not disappointing. Great graphics and character designs with immersive story and combat, no buggs reported from me.Hope they will launch a DLC and i highly recomande this game because it will be Game of the Year for sure in my opinion."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is an excellent game that challenges what you know about the souls-like genre. It is a VERY challenging game, but it respects your time. To me, it serves as a love letter to gamers who just want a cool hack n slash boss rush type game, NO microtransactions, NO battlepass, just pure fun. Pros:- Story is good (albeit hard to understand without research)- Majority of bosses are really well designed- All the characters were likeable/portrayed very well- Combat system was amazing- You are rewarded after every little battle with amazing loot- The way respawning works in this game is perfect. sets you right outside where you died most of the time which I loved- This game was LONG, but in a good way, everytime you unlock something it was nice knowing I have hours of gameplay left to utilize and learn all the mechanicsCons- Lack of play-style variety, I'm certain I used the same build/combos 90% of players used- This is my personal critique, but the lack of direction in a game as linear as this was frustrating most of the time, a mini-map or quest log would have been appreciated, turns out my first playthrough I missed a BUNCH of quests with cool rewards, you don't even get the true ending unless you do research which I don't like- Collision in this game was REALLY rough. I found Wukong floating above the ground slightly/ colliding with small things on the ground blocking the players controls (often leading to falling off the map) wasn't too bad but something I keep catching even 3 playthroughs inOverall it was the most fun I've had so far in the 2024 releases, with some polishing and clearer in-game direction for the player, I could have seen myself liking this game more than I did, I still think it was very well done.9/10"
Positive,"Fantastic game overall, absolutely worth a play if you can pick this up. Has some fantastic visuals and boss designs, I also loved the musical scores and the animated stories at the end of each chapter.It's definitely a challenging experience, not quite Dark Souls difficulty for the most part, it's a lot more forgiving as you have the freedom to respec whenever you want for free and you don't lose currency/exp when you die.Aiming for 100% achievements does unfortunately require some grinding though.In terms of performance, my system with a Ryzen 7 5700X, RTX 3070 and 32GB DDR4-3600 held a mostly stable 60+ FPS experience at 1080p with DLAA and DF optimised settings. There are a couple of effects heavy boss fights with brief drops into the 40s."
Positive,"monkey smash,monlkey brain happy"
Positive,its pretty damn awesome
Positive,reminds me of god of war games. very solid game.
Positive,Best Single Player Game of 2024
Positive,"If you ever wanted to feel like a god, only to get repeatedly destroyed by oversized frogs, this is the game for you!"
Positive,Isso não é um jogo é uma obra de arte em todos os aspectos
Positive,"Worth every penny!.. Graphics are amazing.. Cool stances, spins are super satisfying, little particles and their movement are a beautiful touch.. These small details are just what makes the game worth the time... Not to mention the story telling and unique character introductions.. Its all just too awesome.."
Positive,"It's a fun gameActions couldn't be slower, I feel like there's an intentional lag between my button presses and the characters movements"
Positive,"this game changed my  life forever this game truly showed me the wukong way,the monkey way"
Positive,THIS IS THE GAME OF THE YEAR .
Positive,I see monkey. I like monkey. I play monkey. Monkey is a good game I like.
Positive,Fantastic game. Really enjoyed it. Pretty difficult but worth the time.
Positive,"BUY THIS GAME ASAP, It pays respect to the 1986 adaption of Journey to the West (MUST WATCH) awhile giving you a refined and refreshing Gameplay and Chinese mythology!SPOILER ALERT: Black Myth: Wukong doesn't follow the original novel of JTTW but rather a wonderful twist of what happened and kudos to the studio for making it an enjoyable experience.THIS GAME may be out of context for people who aren't into Chinese mythology or first timers but PLEASE PLEASE give this game a try, It'll be worth your while awhile also watching 1986 Journey to the West show if you want some context."
Positive,"I don't like souls-likes...I don't have patience for them. I suck at those games because my brain is too slow or something. They are clearly not for me. And there's a good chance, I'll never finish Black Myth: Wukong, like I never finished any other souls game I've tried. Thankfully, it's not exactly as punishing as the actual Souls games.But this game is unironically great at pretty much everything and I regret nothing.Great fun and value for your money, polished, stable, solid framerate, amazing visuals, controls are are reliably responsive, no bugs or glitches encountered, no ""current day"" BS included, no microtransactions (yet), just pure oldschool game without nonsense like, for instance, Stellar Blade did it.Easy 8/9 out of 10 for a filthy casual like me.Solid 10 out of 10 if you like souls-likes or being challenged in general. Deserves ALL the praise it gets. All of it.The only thing I would nitpick is that, sometimes, attacks hit you even though they visually don't look like they should. But that's literally everything I have to say on negatives, without inserting my own bias.One of the easiest recommendations I've ever given."
Positive,You alreay know. If this isn't GOTY then its rigged.
Positive,"Very impressive, truly next gen graphic you've never seen before."
Positive,"GOAT GAME, NO MORE WORDS! MONKE OUG OUG"
Positive,"When Black Myth: Wukong dropped, I was very skeptical. I grew up as a huge DBZ fan but had no idea that Wukong was a source of inspiration. Honestly, the game looked like another try-hard, wanna-be souls-like that was simply cashing in on an iconic character. Boy, was I wrong.I started seeing gameplay videos flooding youtube and tiktok. While certainly a very similar feeling to the Souls series when it comes to boss fights, it feels very unique and refreshing in its own way. Combat is top notch, the controls are tight, and the the skill tree is both dense and rewarding. While the core gameplay is comprised of mainly bouncing between boss battles with a few (and I mean, very few) enemies, the ""open world"" feels very good to explore. Each time I tuck into a corner or press forward just a little further to see, I'm often rewarded with a hidden chest. There's a robust crafting system, brewing, spells and transformations galore. Respeccing your character is not only free of charge, but encouraged to try new strategies for each boss. I think my favorite part is there's no lost progress upon death. You always maintain your progress, making death feel more like a minor setback than a soul-crushing experience. Pun fully intended. As a mid-30's gamer, I will not get into games that don't respect my time and this one does so beautifully. But while Black Myth Wukong ticks all of these boxes to make a great game, it's story is what truly captivates me. Rarely do I care about the lore behind bosses, but each of these seem to be hand crafted with great detail and I find myself reading their entries after each boss battle. Learning more of their story is almost as good as the loot. It's a strange, perplexing, and difficult journey and I look forward to more beautifully crafted cut scenes after each chapter. There's only one downside to the game that I can really bring up: You have to git gud. There's no running away and overleveling like Elden Ring. There's no ridiculous OP weapons or summons that will hard carry you through encounters. Often times it's just you, the boss, and all of your abilities on cooldown. There are times that some fights seem ridiculous, but I can honestly say it never feels unfair when I die. The game makes you get up close and learn the dance of each boss. Really gets your blood pumping and once you finally down that boss after multiple attempts, the feeling is euphoric. Because YOU did it. So if that's the only negative, then it's one I'll gladly accept. Getting stuck in the Water Temple for weeks made me appreciate that piece of the Triforce. Downing Ruby and Emerald Weapon after weeks of grinding and min-maxing were moments of monumental bliss. I've got a feeling that Black Myth Wukong has a few achievements like this waiting for me at the end, and I'm looking forward to every second of it. Go buy this game. I'll update this review upon completion, but there's a high chance this will be my favorite release this year. UPDATE EDIT:100 hours in and I've completed the game 100%. All 81 achievements. Currently on NG+3 and still loving it, although I've decided to put it down for now. The sheer enjoyment this game has brought me has made it my personal GOTY. I loved it enough to beat it 3 different times and get all the achievemnets and not once did I ever think ""Aw man, I've gotta log in to do X, Y, Z..."" Through all the trials and tribulations, I have persevered. And it has been the experience I've needed for a long time. P.S. Screw you Developers. How dare you make me actually shed a manly tear over a spider and a pig."
Positive,Easily a 10/10 game.
Positive,Game of the year please
Positive,it telling the story after Journey to the West
Positive,Not at all like playing Monkey King in Dota 2.
Positive,"Well amazing game but not for me. Just too hard. I am sick to death of these souls like games, which this is don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Its frustrating as hell, many of the abilities have long animation locks etc, bosses can take many many many many many many many tries and after a while, even though I do get around to killing them it doesn't feel satisfying or that I am super powerful just because I have this ""magical power"" to fight them 9384579834753489589345 times. It breaks immersion for me and doesn't make me feel like a bad ass god just because I played a memory game of dodge/parry with the boss for over an hour. Guess I am just getting old but these ""souls-like-dodge-parry-memory"" combat games are just getting old. I can tell the design is amazing, the graphics, music, sound effect etc. All top notch production. But its not for me."
Positive,Another str8 banger of a game just wish all areas that were reachable were playable. but this game is one of my favorites!!!
Positive,"just buy it, dont be gay."
Positive,"half way, good story and art design"
Positive,"I am monke. Most difficult boss is Erlang Shen, unless you have the fan and rock guy as your transformation. Man click the link in the bio."
Positive,Game good. You get. Be Happy.
Positive,"I don't know what drug everyone is smoking, but I'd love some of it. Probably the most overrated game of the decade, so far. It's an alright souls-like, and falls off HARD starting in act 3 (the snow biome). But before that it was very fun. It might be that the future acts are better, but if they're all like 3, it's not looking good. Might update this when I get further in the game."
Positive,"Recommended to play though some secrets need to be discovered through guide online xd, great boss fight and scenes, i really love the animation for each ending, overall good game, worth it"
Positive,W game spent 40hrs tryna find a third ending that doesnt exist
Positive,"Very nice game, you would love and keep playing it!"
Positive,"This game is outstanding. Not only does the game manage to deliver on the Journey to the West story, but they manage to do so and keep you engaged throughout.It's still a controversial topic whether this game is a souls-like or not, either way I feel like the game manages to adhere to elements that makes a souls-like fun, challenging and engaging. This game has you fight both optional and, of course, mandatory bosses which all feels like their own.This is an absolute MUST play if you like skill based games, with great stories and ever greater gameplay! Though, if its replayability you're looking for, this game probably isn't for you.NOTE! For anyone about to, or is actively playing this game. The earlier bosses might seem easy, prepare yourself for the ones further into the game. They will not only test your skill and patience, some of them will do so with ease. Also, they might have some aces up their sleeves."
Positive,"Trust me bro, you won't regret it"
Positive,It's like God of War and Elden Ring had a love child but it's a monkey
Positive,"The core gameplay loop for this game is really simple and has a severe impact. After completing all achievements i can confidently say that except for the RNG drops, every single aspect of gameplay was engaging and forced you to focus on the game, be it beautiful graphical scenes or fluid combat. I do say the smash stance is a little bit OP compared to other stances since NG+3 and more, you use the smash stance more than the wukong stance because certain buffs and builds make it deal some severe damage even at that stage. Overall, it is a fantastic game and a strong contender for Game of the Year."
Positive,GOTY worthy game
Positive,"Amazing game, deserves GOTY"
Positive,Such a nice game beautiful graphics and great story line!! 10/10
Positive,monkey ooh ooh ahh ahh
Positive,Embrace misogyny Embrace racism Embrace BEING HIM 10/10 peak cinema Being called Monkey don't sound bad anymore lmao Toriyama sensei knew what he was gonna cook from wukong inspiration
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is not usually my type of game, I am not a fan of souls-like games. But, Wukong story, progression and combat kept me engaged throughout my first playthrough. I enjoyed the game so much, I am already about half way through my second playthrough and it's not often I even play a game that isn't Virtual Reality more than once. Mix this with my dislike for the souls-like genre and it shows how good this game actually is.Outside of this the lore, the visuals and sound scope in outstanding. The boss battles and grand in design and where you have to expect to die, it didn't become frustrating and the feeling of accomplishment when you take one down is massive. It's also great the see a game that delves into another culture and explore an ancient Chinese folklore."
Positive,Monkey go bonk! 10/10
Positive,monkey is cool
Positive,"This game is a labor of love, and a masterpiece to behold. Become the MONKAY."
Positive,Journey to the weast
Positive,"I am on my 4th playthrough now. I have had hundreds of hours of fun with this game, and will continue to do so. I missed a secret ending, so I have to get a 4th for special stance everywhere. I'll end up playing it a 5th time to unlock EVERYTHING and do a 100% run. I am eagerly awaiting the DLC. I though a 8/10 when I finished my 1st playthrough, but I am upping it to a 9/10. Only drawbacks are some slight bugs and the game is a bit overly demanding on cinematics which causes audio and video stuttering. That's on Ultra Performance and lowest settings. I have a Ryzen 9 5900x and a RTX 3080Ti. It's still easy Top 5 games I've ever played."
Positive,Unbelievable game play and story. Graphics are also so Immersive.
Positive,A game that never disappoints when devs take their time to create a masterpiece and not rush just to meet a sellout deadline. Insane game that everyone should play whether on sale or not.
Positive,BEST GAME EVERRR!!!
Positive,Very nice game
Positive,GOAT game as always
Positive,"I had the chance to dive into this game early, drawn in by its impressive Gamescom trailer, and let me tell you—it has surpassed all my expectations in the best way possible. From the moment I started playing, I was blown away by the sheer beauty and attention to detail in the graphics. The visuals are not just lifelike; they transport you into a world so vivid and immersive that it feels like you’re exploring a living, breathing landscape. Every scene is crafted with such precision, from the smallest environmental details to the grand, picturesque vistas, that it often feels more like you’re watching an epic film rather than playing a game.The cinematics are awe-inspiring, seamlessly blending into the gameplay, giving the whole experience a cinematic flow that’s almost movie-like. But what truly stands out for me is the incredible artwork throughout the game, particularly the anime-style epilogues that close each chapter. These moments are a brilliant artistic touch, and they bring a unique flair that’s rarely seen in this genre. Each epilogue is like a work of art on its own, offering a beautiful, hand-drawn break from the intense action and immersing you even deeper into the story.Now, I’m on my fifth playthrough, and I still find new details and moments to appreciate each time. The level of craftsmanship in both the design and storytelling makes it a game you can’t just experience once. There’s always something more to discover, be it in the intricacies of the combat, the depth of the world-building, or the stunning environments that are nothing short of mesmerizing.If there’s one area where the game didn’t quite hit the mark for me, it would be the English dubbing, particularly for Wukong. The audio felt slightly underwhelming compared to the rest of the game’s exceptional quality. It wasn’t bad by any means, but it didn’t fully capture the depth and intensity of the character in the way I had hoped. However, this is a minor gripe in what is otherwise a masterclass in game design.Overall, this game has been a phenomenal purchase—one that I can confidently recommend to any gamer, especially those who appreciate top-tier visuals, breathtaking art, and an unforgettable experience. It’s a true work of art in the gaming world, and I’m sure it will leave a lasting impression on anyone who plays it."
Positive,"GOTY, simple as. Especially recommended for players of advanced age who are becoming increasingly reluctant to play games from start to finish. It managed to rekindle my desire to play games for hours without end again."
Positive,"Monke go bonk. With a cool soundtrack, beautiful visuals and great story."
Positive,One of the best game I've ever played. Living my childhood Journey to the West and now I got to play as Wukong himself.
Positive,"75+ hours in and I've got nothing but compliments. I could nit-pick a couple of things, but they pale in comparison to the overall package of what this game is....and that is boat-loads of fun."
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong did everything right. People who complain about the developer past history and the drama are lying to you.No microtranactions, Overdelivering, and Underpromising and tons of other factors like great and smooth gameplay make this game of the year!Combat is so fast, responsive, and smooth!"
Positive,Great game even for people who are not very good at games like sekiro.But you will need a deep knowledge of Chinese culture to understand the story and the behaviors of characters.
Positive,These people deserve game of the yearMy only regret that in pre-order it I completely forgot about it
Positive,"I usually don’t play ""soulslike"" games, but I tried Black Myth: Wukong because it’s not as dark and gothic as others like Elden Ring or Dark Souls. The game’s full ray tracing was a big draw for me, and it didn’t disappoint. I played on an AMD 5800X CPU, 64 GB RAM, NVMe M.2 SSD Samsung 990 Pro, and Nvidia RTX 4080 Super GPU in 4K with DLSS Performance and full ray tracing. The game ran at a mostly stable 60 FPS, using around 12 GB RAM, with 23 GB utilized when I had other apps open.As a newbie to this genre and a mouse-and-keyboard gamer, I found the game challenging at first but got the hang of it. I prefer story games and don’t enjoy repeatedly fighting hard bosses. I got stuck at the end boss of Chapter 2, deleted the game, then returned later and used cheats to progress.The game’s chapters are beautifully made with a variety of enemies and customization options. You can reset skill points anytime, allowing for different loadouts. Unlike other soulslike games, Black Myth: Wukong offers cutscenes and a cinematic experience, which I appreciated. It tells a story with beautiful music, atmosphere, and fantastic visuals, making it enjoyable even for inexperienced players like me. If I can do it with a mouse and keyboard, so can you! 😊"

Positive,Great action game. More like God of War Series than a Soulslike.
Positive,This is the hardest RPG game I have ever played and had so much stories and hidden bosses. Well worth the try.
Positive,"After beating the game 6 times with true ending and completed all the achievements ,best game 2024 so far goty for me !!!"
Positive,"Peak story, peak mechanics, peak game. Really well executed and is very enjoyable."
Positive,"This is a very difficult game, but I feel like they give you just enough to let you feel like you can achieve it with just a bit more strategy and or patience. The graphics look great, and the music and sounds are awesome too. The story line for me is a little bit esoteric, but that's ok, it just makes me want to go and learn more about the mythology which is underlying this game. I've had very very minor bugs/glitches, but not enough to put me off.Overall i would give this a 9/10"
Positive,monkey go bonk 10/10
Positive,"Gorgeous, fun and no DEI garbage in the game, unlike pretty much every triple A game nowadays."
Positive,"Wait, so all the other positive reviews were actually right!?"
Positive,"Almost 100% it. Lots of different ability's and you can re-spec for free whenever you want. I found myself not wanting to miss anything which it rewards you for. still stuff to do in new game plus. Really good story.Ran pretty good, some frame drops when entering a new area. Had no idea about Journey to the west or Sun Wukong but now I am getting into it. (Just 100% it, first game I have done that)"
Positive,"Firstly, I’ll start off with calling out Cry Baby Inc. Do not listen to their garbage. This game holds true to Chinese lore and is truly a polished epic. All the hate on this and then seeing the soaring sales and active player counts made me purchase this out of curiosity. Wow was I amazed.You can tell Game Science put a lot of love into this game. It’s not perfect by any means, but this is most certainly Game of the Year in my eyes. It’s sad we have big name reviewers such as IGN being overtaken by DEI boards and working with people like SBI who are purposely uglifying and ruining everything touched out of hatred for gamers and themselves.Now to the game. There’s many positives and a few negatives I will get to. Overall completion took around 70 hours with completing almost everything. All bosses/side quests/secrets.Enjoyed:•The combat system felt very fluid. I didn’t feel any delay and had a lot of fun with all the builds and styles. Straight forward, but takes some practice to really get the hang of counters/perfect dodges etc... I’m usually M&K but played this one on controller. It felt great.•Difficulty was perfect. I like that there’s no difficulty settings, one size fits all approach. Many people compare this to GOW or Elden Rings. I’ve only played Elden Rings so I can’t really compare the two. It has characteristics of Elden Rings but without all the dumb rage mechanics. I stopped playing Elden Rings about 70% through the game just due to all the annoying roadblocks the devs put into the game to annoy you. BMW has difficult bosses, but nothing was unbearable or too grindy. Elden Rings fails at this for casual gamers like me who do not want to spend 3-6 hours on 1 boss or hours finding a boss to only fall through the floor because there’s a hidden hole you can’t see unless you’ve already died to it…. You lose progression and time, it gets annoying, ultimately led to me losing interest in playing. There’s no loss of materials, xp or currency in BMW when dying. I also like how they separate the currency and XP unlike Elden Rings. •You can pause the game.•Crafting and medicines work without being annoying. Have purpose.•Exploration while sometimes felt linear, I was pleasantly excited after chapter 1 as the world opens much more. I never felt lost, never felt like I didn’t know what I needed to do next.•Environment was visually stunning. Very well made, and polished. Great performance on my PC. FPS was not capped. Looked awesome in 4K.Disliked:•Out of the 70 hours I had 2-3 crashes. I’m on a high-end system and average about 100-120FPS on very high settings. •There were some chapters that didn’t seem as optimized as the earlier ones. Not highly noticeable.•Flying bosses/enemies, the camera will be your hardest obstacle. I felt like this needs some work/adjustment.•Some boss’s ultimate abilities make it very difficult to see. Not sure if this was done on purpose but it can be a bit annoying.•chapter 3 – jail felt very drawn out and long. Not my most enjoyable chapter Thank you for producing such a game and listening to the gamers. Game Science did a fantastic job with this, and I will be waiting for more DLC. It would be shameful to skip these games achievements due to a few ugly green haired creatures who are yet again offended.Rated: 4.8/5Sincerely,American Gamers"
Positive,"monkey hit, monkey jump monkey good,."

Positive,"Best game of this year, deserves GOTY"
Positive,"SINJ TAPER KAILLOU, SINJ CONTENT"
Positive,"Didn't know about this until it dropped, is straight fire, we need more Chinese mythology/cultivation souls-likes that are actually good like this game. 10/10"
Positive,"Great game, lot of culture and amazing visuals/graphics, some rigid gameplay but you get used to it. I 100%'d it, so my veredict is: It's a great souls/sekiro-like game. One of the few games of these type not made by Fromsoftware that I enjoyed (fav is Lies of P). I recommend it a lot. Good job to the devs and congrats to China for their first triple A game."
Positive,"A true masterpiece in terms of design! A breath of fresh air after souls like games! You don't need to waste couple hours for one boss, but you can enjoy experiencing huge amount of different fights. Every chapter of the game is just stunning. Fascinating stories that combine into one really solid and interesting piece make this game GOTY for me."
Positive,"Rating: 9/10Gameplay (10/10): The dodge mechanics are super satisfying, and there’s a good variety of builds to try out. The bosses are just the right amount of challenging to help you get better without being frustrating.Exploration (9/10): Secret zones are a lot of fun to find! I just wish there were more puzzles or areas to explore. Would've been cool to have more hidden spots.Graphics (10/10): The visuals are absolutely stunning—seriously one of the best-looking games I’ve ever seen. Every little detail is top-notch.World Building (10/10): The world feels really unique, with every zone having its own vibe. It’s such a cool experience, especially with that awesome opening cutscene that pulls you right in.Story (8/10): The cutscenes are great, but the story is delivered in a cryptic way, kinda like Elden Ring. Even after going through all the journals, it’s still hard to piece everything together.Boss Design (10/10): The bosses are fun and not as punishing as Elden Ring. Only a few were annoying, but most were a good time. The Erlang Shen fight was the toughest and definitely my favorite.What could be better: Sometimes the invisible walls take you out of the moment, but it’s a small thing. The story could use a bit more focus to make it easier to follow.PS: The only 10/10 games I've played are TW3 & Elden Ring"

Positive,GET THIS GAMEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!
Positive,"i loved it , good job gamescience ."
Positive,Best Game Ever
Positive,great gma easily game of the year unless the DLC of Elden Ring is counted
Positive,40~ hrs in and every minute has been super entertaining and very fun! Admittedly when the game was first revealed a few yrs ago I was skeptical. Now I'm glad I bought into the hype! Can't wait to see the rest of the bosses in the game 🙌
Positive,"What a beautiful game this was. I was so emotionally invested the whole way through because of how much thought and depth that went into this game. I have been following Chinese mythology from a young age and this satisfied my itch for the topic/genre, the game really does go balls deep on the lore."
Positive,Its like god of war and souls in one. Difficulty is slightly below souls games. Difficult but addicting worth every penny
Positive,monkey make me rage
Positive,Best single player
Positive,"Wukong: Black Myth is a visually stunning, challenging action RPG that brought back nostalgic memories of the movie The Forbidden Kingdom. The game’s world is rich with myth and fantasy, drawing you deeper with its atmosphere. But what really stands out are the boss fights—each one is brutally tough, making you rage with every failed attempt, but the satisfaction of finally winning is unmatched.The combat is challenging but rewarding, requiring careful timing and strategy. It’s punishing, but the sense of accomplishment is incredible. If you're looking for a game that pushes you to your limits, this is it."
Positive,"A near-masterpiece, brilliant game and epic tale, definitely a strong contender for GOTY! 9/10 for meCompetition is definitely weak this year and Black Myth Wukong is truly a welcome change to how AAA games tend to release nowadays: No live service, no 3rd party account requirement and no micro-transaction of ANY kind. You get a great single player game that knows what it's about. I found it to be mostly bug free, none that bothered me anyway. The game looks amazing and the amount of assets modeled for it is staggering, the mo-cap and voice acting are top tier (both in CN and EN), the soundtrack is beautiful and the story is wonderful and confusing in the best way possible. As I had no real knowledge of the rich mythology the game is steeped in, I was truly captivated in just the first Chapter. There are a lot of characters in the game and if you are not familiar with the cultural and religious elements in the game like I am it can be hard to follow motives and understand how everything fits together but exploring the lore is as good as the fighting itself.This is exactly why I would rate Wukong higher than God of War on a story basis as it was all new to me which made it that much more interesting. There are many lessons of morality with a lot of nuance and depth in a really well told and well paced story, except for the final chapter in my opinion. And it is not just a totally fresh setting but also the much higher difficulty that makes the game that much more rewarding. While I did enjoy that, it did too often feel like a boss was either far too challenging or a complete pushover, the progression in GoW is clearly more refined. To put it simply: I struggled a lot more in the first 2 Chapters than in the last 4 and that didn't feel quite right. Some fights also rely on specific items to take most of the challenge out, but the items do require you to explore optional areas with optional bosses. What I liked is how the game often forces you to adapt your build to the boss and there is no one-size-fits-all build that I found as some may be mostly immune to the spell or attack style you are relying too much on. I still don't really get why the early bosses were that tough as I cleared many of the last ones on the first go. As there is no punishment for dying the game is nowhere near as challenging as a souls game; personally I would rate some of the bosses in Chapter 1 as highly as the toughest Valkyries in GoW so it's definitely a challenging game and closer to Sekiro or Souls than GoW difficulty wise so do beware, and try to git gud; I had to.Clearly made by a very passionate and talented team that have a bright future ahead of them. It has an original story that has never been told as a AAA game and the combat combines many gameplay mechanics to create something unique but not unfamiliar. I felt the devs went beyond the standard set by western studios in many respects. It is a high quality product, with a few rough edges, sure, but it in some areas they really went all-out. There are many aspects like the artwork, 3D models and animated cut-scene that truly push the envelop so I hope Black Myth Wukong will be the first of many Chinese titles to succeed as games should when they are this well made."
Positive,"Hello there. First time writing a review but imma share my experience rather just saying good or bad. Positive first and Negative later.(Post DLC announcement)Overall the game is a good experience for me, who is a gamer. The graphics are insanely demanding of pc resources, which is typical for an unreal engine 5 game. Despite medium graphics, I actually enjoyed it a lot. The story is good, not comparing to other games cause I feel it’s pointless, rather I could say compare the experience felt playing the game. The visuals and the story are depicted of Chinese culture which is really good and builds up the curiosity to know more about it. Well it’s not a soulslike game but the bosses are pretty fun, and I pushed like NG+3 and it’s getting a bit tough (First playthrough was hard and later NG+ and NG++ were just cheesing through) but yet to experience everything just find out whole rather than going through main routes (hidden bosses and stuff).There are downsides obviously. The game feels awfully short; mind you, I just saw the announcement video day before yesterday where they actually planned to release 13 chapters (approx idk actual but it’s around that and imma purchase dlc fs), end chapter animation, pure art. Just pure art. Love the animation and backstory. Sometimes the game just gets laggy and I have to switch tab and back to game to stop it. There’s no map and exploring from Chapter 3 feels headache cause without walkthroughs (I used from NG+) it’s just circling the same area. Honestly without a map (Yes Sekiro has a map) it feels linear and not much exploration. The story is short and honestly it wasn’t a bit issue for me, cause Elden ring was massive to explore for me. After getting or achieving the true ending, you actually know the reason of the game. I mean there’s no bad ending but it feels incomplete without clearing all the hidden bosses (and the hidden areas are good too). Overall I love the game and I won’t rate cause I can’t but let’s just say it’s in my Top 7 (Cyberpunk 1st obv, Budokai Tenkaichi 3, Elden Ring, Sekiro, Battlefront II and RDR2). Hoping the new DLC would have new and exciting content, would like to see Wukong’s master and the Jade emperor (ifykyk the actual story). Thanks for reading this. Monke."
Positive,"Play and enjoy the game!No shit like microtransactions, skins or something. Just a very nice and good game Would give more than one thumb up if i could!"
Positive,"An AMAZING Action RPG!The game looks beautiful, the setting is great, and the gameplay feels smooth like butter. The story is great, it really gets you invested to learn more about it, like the background of characters, what the relationship between them is, etc. - the game only got me more excited to learn about the full story and Chinese mythology in general. Yes, the storytelling can be a bit confusing and/or scattered all over the place, especially with some of the end-of-chapter cutscenes, but all the more reason to dive in to find out more about it!While I get the comparison to Soulslike games, it isn’t exactly that. Yes, it borrows elements from Soulslike games, for example the mechanics of bosses, but it does play a lot easier than most Souls games. It’s much more forgiving, especially because of the simple fact that if you die, it’s not really a problem. You just respawn at the latest shrine and you don’t lose any progress or items in that sense.All in all, I loved everything about it and I wish it would’ve been more chapters, but it’s fair enough that they couldn’t realize that with the budget they had. Really looking forward to any DLC that might come in the future. Also, NG+ is highly recommended, as it’s a lot of fun!

Positive,Best game I've played this year..
Positive,"Has the elements of a soulsborne game, GoW, and GoT. Although Elden Ring is still my number 1 game, this game follows right behind closely. The only gripe I have is story-telling. This is as majestic and encapsulating as the games I mentioned but lore-wise, it's akin to GoW and that game was based on Greek Mythology which is known east to west. The same cannot be said with Journey to the West. Surely Sun Wu Kong is popular in contemporary media, but the novel itself not so. The animations helped tremendously, but did not fully communicate to players the in-game lore. This game is very unlike ER where the overworld lore is new, and so much like Tolkien's world, the lore of ER can be kept cryptic allowing the community to speculate and for the lore to mature over time. Black Myth Wukong should have at least communicated the basic story elements of the Journey to the West novel on which the in-game lore was made. 9.8/10 - the 0.2 being the story-telling."
Positive,"i love this and i highly recommend it but ever since the patch update, my graphics card has been crashing and i know its the update since i have elden ring and most other games at max graphics.please fix this, i love the combat and lore that this game gives"
Positive,"This game is a true masterpiece, with every battle being absolutely thrilling. The storytelling is well written, and the design is both unique and flawless. A perfect 10/10!"
Positive,"Dear Black People, I hope this game doesn't find you offended"
Positive,Very well optimized and enjoyable
Positive,Monkey with stick good.
Positive,great graphics but few bosses are very tough
Positive,"Games super fun wasnt sure if it was gonna be for me but, Im having a blast and definitely lives up to the hype surrounding it. The game is challenging enough but nothing that'll make you wanna beat your head off a wall, like the souls series.  Personally there is a lack of story, its not enough to sell the game but the combat and bosses are just so good it makes up for it. Kind of a God Of War feel mixed in with Dark Souls. If your uncertain about it id say scew it and just buy it like i did 10/10 would recommend.... i also never leave reviews, but this game deserves one."
Positive,In 2024 it feels like it's been 12 years since a game released at this standard of quality. Black Myth: Wukong makes a few uniquely positive changes to the traditional purgatorial souls-like formula & is a challenging yet entertaining adventure.
Positive,"Great game, except for the fact that IT DOES NOT HAVE A FUCKING MAP"
Positive,"Game was pretty fun indeed, 10/10 would monkey all over monkey again"
Positive,oh my GOD
Positive,"Ubisoft, EA and Sony this is what a good game looks like."
Positive,"It's one of the games you absolutely have to play. It's so much fun and exhilarating, with everything from boss battles to story, characters, mythology, and lore. There are certain games every gamer should absolutely play like Hell Divers 2, Eldin Ring, TOTK, Baldurs Gate 3,,,Wukong is one of them, will not disappoint. Probably GOTY.  - From a Lifelong Gamer"
Positive,"Monke go BRRRRRRRbut seriously, you can make this game as complex or as simple as you want. The combat is incredibly satisfying especially when fighting bosses with very cool and complex movesets that take a while to register to someone like me who doesn't play these kinds of games too often. The animation, the lore, and the dialogue are topnotch. Easily one of the best games I have ever played."
Positive,Apenas deixou a desejar no ultimo cap.
Positive,"monke play, monke happy"
Positive,IM A FIGHTING MONKEY DUHHHHH!!!!!!!! HOW COULD I HATE THIS??????
Positive,"great game but check the specs of your computer first, i forgot to and now i have 8-bit trees everywhere."
Positive,"Masterpiece, one of the greatest games I have ever played, looking forward to what comes next!"
Positive,"this is fun , i would totally recommed it"
Positive,Nerf Yellow Long bro
Positive,"Amazing game. The story, the boss fights were all on point. The air wall is a bit disappointing but did not impact the game's playability to much. First time in a few years since RDR2 I've dedicated so much time in a non Dota2 game!"
Positive,very good game ^^ i'm having a good and hard time in the same time^^ if you like dark souls then you def gonna like this game too! i can highly recommend it ^^
Positive,monkey and a big stick
Positive,it was so exhilirating to play
Positive,Incredible fun game with amazing graphics. Definitely worth my time and money.
Positive,"is good game, the game subbed is written in like shakespeare age english to reflect the time period. the chapter 2 song is a banger. Animations can sometimes be janky with too many inputs at once but with enough WILL and skill this is a good ol time. Satisfying boss battles I don't think I've had one boss battle that I hated or thought was unfair it always came down to my gamer code. Set pieces are pretty good to playthrough and the game itself is wonderful to look at although to avoid some of the graphical glitches like messed up shadows and lighting from what I've seen playing on two differently spec'd Pcs. Ray-Tracing is more of a requirement to avoid those. YOU PLAY AS MONKEY THEREFORE I LIKE THIS GAME."
Positive,"The plot of this game takes place after Journey to the West and creates a reasonable aftermath. If you have read/watched the original, it is going to resonate with you more. It also explores the paradox of absolute good and evil. Even gods in the high up have their own agenda, emotion and desire while the so-called villains (yaoguai) are capable of cherishing affection and loyalty, may think differently from gods and simply act on what is best for them.Gameplay wise, it is a seamless fusion of linear level design, soulslike combat system and features (e.g. dodge roll, bonfire, healing flask and stamina bar), epic cinematics and even animations in unique style. The last chapter may feel a little bit rushed due to its length. However, the mix of everything does not stop both the storytelling and gameplay of this game from being immersive, smooth and really enjoyable."
Positive,SIMPLY PUT THE BEST GAME EVER
Positive,we can be a monkey together hahaha :)
Positive,Game Of The Year
Positive,"Just get it, this shit so peak words aren't gonna do it justice. 20/10 would reincarnate in this world 4 more times just to re-experience this peak fiction again."
Positive,"Loved it and I'm not a soul's like person, right balance"
Positive,"Fun game, really hard for a casual player like me , the only downside is bad opimization."
Positive,Monke good.Monke fight.Monke win.Monke sometimes lose.Monke become stonger.Monke strong.Best monke.
Positive,"The game is pretty fun, some people find it pretty hard as myself when I started playing it. The game doesn't explain a lot. I modded my game for my personal enjoyment and now I'm in my second play through. Some people have played through the game 4 times already, which is crazy to me. But to each his own. I don't think this will net a third run from me, but good enough for a 2nd playthrough."
Positive,This game is beautiful...frustrating...but beautiful
Positive,the best game in 2024
Positive,"cool monke, deep lore, many boss fight. 10/10"
Positive,better than warframe
Positive,-Amazing story telling-Never encounter any bug during 85 hours gameplay-smooth gameplay-my very first game to unlock full achievement -difficulty i would say 7 out of 10Cant wait for the DLC
Positive,"Yeah, its a good game. Just be warned for completionists: There is a *ton* of permanantly missable content and a number of NG+ exclusive items for achievements, as well as RNG mechanics for things like plant seeds and certain item drops."
Positive,"I used to watch Journey to the West during my childhood as my parents would always play them on TV. Didn't really know it was about Chinese Mythology till much later, but I did know I really enjoyed them as a kid. Seeing this kid and learning about the various lore of Sun Wukong and the celestial heaven was truly fascinating. This game had remarkable story-telling and the bosses were entertaining to say the least. I had a wonderful time traversing as the ""Destined One,"" utilizing various spells, combos, and transformations to my disposal. Additionally the soundtrack is truly amazing, especially the one that played in the end; it was a good reminisce to the old TV show. Overall, 10/10: game-of-the-year worthy."
Positive,"Get gut! Only motivation you need, it's hard but once you unlock a few skills and more health it's more easy. Still very hard though! Like a souls game but the monkey is more agile and you don't lose everything after you die :)"
Positive,"My 5th Platinum ever, speaks to the amazing quality and masterfully executed gaming loop, probably the most fun I've had since Elden Ring!Stunning graphics, mindblowing art direction and pain stakingly crafted levels and lore, hard to believe this is a first attempt by Game Design studio.I'd never heard of Journey to the West, or the Monkey King - Sun Wukong, earlier, but time to catch up on this Epic now, after this game.And I've heard that some aspects of the Monkey King, in the Chinese Epic, were inspired by Hanuman (seems obvious and the culturals exchanges that happened over 1000s of years), and this made my run even more enjoyable.Currently on NG++ run, and still having a hard time letting it go for something else.Absolutely must play, notwithstanding what any reviewers are saying. This is the best thing to come out of China, and I hope an Indian studio also makes one, on Hanuman, as good as this, someday"
Positive,"What an absolute Banger of a game!!!If you arent hooked after the intro (that takes around 15 minutes) this game is not for you, but honestly go expirience it for yourself ingame or watch someones playthrough for the intro.A big action adventure filled with challanges/mysterys/beauty and most of all fun!Played for 77Hours, because I wanted to get all the achievements, but you can get it all done in around 30-40Hours.Loved every second playing and if I ever will upgrade my graphics card I will for sure return to this beauty just to look at the impressive use of unreal 5 engine. From the incredible modelled landscape to the different awesome designs of enemies and bosses this game looks stunning even on my nvidia 1070ti.The only downside (and thats really a niece thing for achievementhunters) would be that some achievements are locked behind RNG drops by enemies/plants. But if you dont care about 100% completion of those you will have a fanatastic time in my personal game of the year 2024!"
Positive,Finally 100% achievement! Graphic : 100/100Story : 100/100Game Play : 100/100
Positive,"THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOOOO AWESOME, I DONT WANT TO FINISH....STORYLINE and mechanics.. LINEAR BUT in a different way. Satisfied my taste SEKIRO+GOW+Bloodborne..... DAMN i hope another like this from the devs PLEASE!!!!!"
Positive,"Incredible visuals, smooth animation, engaging story and it's just getting better each chapter. Highly recommended."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong has been an amazing journey! I enjoyed the gameplay, sound design, music, characters, and the fantastic world-building as well as the many references to the books too. One of my favorite features are the incredible music videos that play after finishing each chapter, adding a unique touch to the experience before laying the chapter to rest. Even the enemy AI was quite impressive and stuck the most with me with the animations. Though the English dub was not synced properly with the lips of speaking characters which makes me recommend the amazing Chinese Dub of the game.While there were a few minor issues, they’re mostly nit-picky. For instance, I found that some paths lacked clarity. I like to complete all side objectives before progressing the main story/path, but more than once, I accidentally stumbled onto the main path. Maybe I missed a subtle hint or something that was explained inside the game itself, but it was frustrating to unexpectedly trigger a boss fight and then be forced into the next chapter. Unfortunately, once this happens, there’s no way to go back without starting the new chapter and using the shrine to return to the previous Chapter.Aside from that small nit-pick, Black Myth: Wukong is undoubtedly my game of the year. It’s a must-play for anyone who enjoys action-packed, immersive gaming experiences as well as the fans that enjoyed the books and many forms medias adapted from it such as Dragon Ball and etc!"
Positive,"Got every achievement, and now I'm sad there's nothing left to do!"
Positive,One of the game of 2024 for sure... <3
Positive,"Monke See, Monke Smash"
Positive,Fun experience but need high specs PC for immersive experience.
Positive,The whole dev team and everyone involved deserves to have a nice cold pillow on both sides with all of their wishes come true. Absolute Cinema 🙌🙌
Positive,"as a 40 plus female player, love it love it love it"
Positive,"Easily GOTY. Insane graphics, great story, and gameplay. Super addicting and worth the bucks."
Positive,"Amazing game, great story and gameplay, GOTY 2024 for sure"
Positive,monke gud. play monke
Positive,"Memorizing the bosses' movements to achieve victory is not funy since Elden Ring. You like that mechanics? go ahead, this is your kinda game."
Positive,Great for a few minutes or a few hours.  Glad I picked this one up!
Positive,"One of, if not, the best games ive ever played. The game just keeps on giving. Well worth the money, hype, and time investment."
Positive,Monke with big stick
Positive,Monke unga bunga smash
Positive,I LOVE BEATING PEOPLE WITH A STICK
Positive,"Tremendo juego!, tarde mas de una hora y media en matar a un pitufo cabezon gigante... 10/10"
Positive,Thank you for making this game.BUT  please add3 things to make this game better until the dlc:1) Have Wukong’s armour set & staff be noticeably stronger than everything else.2) Have your base abilities and skills get stronger after each level like in the first 2 play throughs 3) Have a permanent Wukong stance w/ small skill tree.
Positive,One of the best Games I have ever played
Positive,GOTYEdit after 24 hrs:Not only GOTY but now Im also 2 weeks into Bo staff training.
Positive,"REVIEW: Black Myth Wukong 🐒Playtime: 61 hours Explored every corner, did every boss fight (except the final secret, doing it now) and just wow.+ Incredible visuals & world design, Chinese Mythology is new to me and I am beyond sold on it now+ Fantastic gameplay, A blend of Sekiro, God of War and Souls mechanics ended up working beautifully+ Unbelieveable quality & polish for a studio's first ever game+ So many incredible boss fights in both visual design and gameplay, varying from really easy to bosses that took me hours (yellowwind ugh)+ Amazing OST & character animations+ One of my all-time favourite final boss fights+ Variety in environments between each chapter were really cool+ All the armors you can craft look fire, they went so hard for basically monkey armor+ End of Chapter animations and painting interaction offered some genuinely interesting life wisdom+ monke- Invisible Walls are really annoying and definitely need to be cleaned up for their next game- i wish there were more worthwhile secrets dotted around- Chapters 1 & 2 feel too linearConclusion: Black Myth Wukong is an incredible game, and a downright miracle that it's this team's first ever title. They absolutely cooked and I adored my time so much with Wukong, It is my GOTY of 2024 so far and I would recommend it to everyone.Black Myth Wukong is a 9/10 from me, I really expect a sequel to this or expansion to be a 10/10 masterpiece as well because this dev team has insane talent and I can't wait to see more."
Positive,10/10 would Monke again
Positive,We are the monke
Positive,Its fun being Monkey
Positive,very addictive game
Positive,"10/10 on everything. There's not much room for improvement here as the game is absolutely astonishing in every single aspect. The graphics are incredible, gameplay the same, story really good. I simply cannot say anything bad regarding the game because I would be lying if I do so. If you're thinking about it buying it, don't think it and just do it cause it is worth every single euro."
Positive,Just simply Incredible
Positive,Game of the year 2024.
Positive,big Fire bear kicked my ass for the last 30 real life minutes
Positive,"GAME OF THE YEAR! This game truly is amazing. If you love great combat, amazing graphics, good music and characters, then this game is for you. Highly recommend. I would rate this game a solid 10 and it is going to have future DLC which is a bigger plus. There are perks to new game plus so the replay value is there too."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a gorgeous action RPG where you play as the Monkey King, fighting through a world inspired by Chinese mythology. The visuals are stunning, and the combat is fast-paced, with cool abilities that keep things fresh. It’s challenging but in a way that makes you want to get better, especially during the boss fights. If you’re into mythology and tough-but-rewarding gameplay, this game’s definitely worth a try.Rating: 9/10"
Positive,"There is no difficulty settings but it is good to see my skills getting better with increasing difficulty. Just started this game and I am already enjoying it, first game on my first gaming PC."
Positive,"No regret, best game played in so many years, it will only get better as you progress the story."
Positive,perfect monkey game
Positive,Time to become monke
Positive,Game of the Year: 2024. Period.
Positive,"GOTY. Enough said I guess.On a serious note. Fantastic storytelling, amazing fighting mechanics, and for sure enough fighting to claim the previous statement. If I really dig deep to find something to complain about, then I have to go with the secrets being, well, SECRETS. Sometimes it felt that the secrets were almost impossible to find, without some sort of guidance at least. Will give this one a solid 5/5. Could even say, that the game is worth every penny, even at full price."
Positive,Visually beautiful! Great game if your into the souls genre! Highly recommend
Positive,This song  + This game = Peak gaming experience
Positive,"Instant buy this game just to prove that: Chinese gaming industry > Woke + Sweet BabyNext time, any game you guys put in the terms ""Lacking in Inclusivity and Diversity"", we'll 100% pre-order it."
Positive,"I should start saying that I have finished Elden Ring and loved it to the bone, though I said myself that I should not buy such games anymore as it is an extreme time consumption if you really want to explore and learn how to play it. I believe I gave ER 200h+ and there were bosses which I had to try 50 times to really achieve a reasonable strategy towards them.That being said, Black Myth is not Elder Ring at all. It is a linear (compared to ER), boss to boss game. I just recently finished the first (standard) ending and going to continue on the the second one. How do I feel about Wukong? Well, there were times when I wanted to destroy my TV - especially with the very last fight with myself and 100eye fella. I didn't have such emotional deprivation with ER somehow. I was thinking - when I perfectly doge 98% of his attacks, kick his a** as hell and yet he still beats me, is this the design I want to play?Then I had a break and think maybe I don't get this game, I must be doing something wrong that after 50 tries (as my limit in ER) I can't beat the last boss..at that time I almost uninstalled the game and wanted to write a letter to the dev team that I am not sure if I am lacking some key skill or they just overkill it being inspired by Malenia**2.So having a few days off and thinking about the game..and somehow, something clicked inside me...I realized that I am repeating same thing as I do in my life - if I can't make it, I just try harder..but throughout my life I have realized that sometimes having step back and do things differently is better than learning hard-core the same thing over and over again.So I started exploring the game again, finished another 2 secret ares which I missed before and after 2 days came back to the final boss and finished him at the first try.My feelings about the game, after accepting the design of the game, are just growing. It meant somehow much more than finishing the game for me. It reminded me my weaknesses in my life, that being persistent and disciplined is not the most beautiful way. It often leads to the result and right end, but not necessarily enjoyable way. Sometimes, just accepting obvious facts, doing things differently and ""go with the flow"" brings much more joy and amazing result..that just happened for me in Wukong and I am grateful to the dev team to providing me almost spiritual journey! Enjoy Your journey and remember, anger, disappointment or frustration can be used in many different ways, sometimes even to find something very beautiful within.. :)"
Positive,Monke hit ppl with oversized stik
Positive,"I am Chinese and this game is that kind of game which come into my mind when i was sleeping.Now my childish dream comes true.People all over the world,you should try this game!"
Positive,"This game is based on the Chinese novel ""Journey to the west"" from the 16th century and is a sort of spiritual sequel to this story. It's filled with characters from Chinese mythology.The gameplay is a mix between God of War with a pinch of Dark Souls.The graphics are stunning. The game is running on the UE5 engine.The only complaint i have is the amount of invisible walls. Other than that i ended up enjoying the game a lot more then i was expecting.Highly recommended!"
Positive,awesome swag skibidiiiii fr fr on god
Positive,Very good 👍
Positive,"Good game. Would've been better if the story had more exposition and coherence. Also, you don't really get to play as Sun Wukong after the prologue. I would've liked it a lot more if we got to play as Sun Wukong with his witty quips and lots of voicelines and interactions with characters."
Positive,"Honestly I've never spent this much on a Game before.(I'm that kind of person who loves discount / free stuff) But this is definitely worth every money & effort I spend so far.As a player who never played a soulsborne genre, it was hard at first. Once I get used to it, I found out it wasn't that difficult but much more enjoyable when dodging,countering enemy's skill.I continue my progress when I'm free and follow the guide on each chapter which is very helpful. Of course I spend hours while fighting the boss and rage out sometimes (especially tiger vanguard). I always take a deep breath and calm myself as I know ""Patience is the key"". if I somehow enjoying the game, I'm willing to complete it no matter how hard it was.The graphics of this game is 10/10 ( If you have a high-end pc) . I played on a laptop with RTX 3050 Ti on lowest setting 60fps FSR + compatibility mode still crashes out sometimes.Overall I would definitely recommend this game. The Story , Battle Scene , Weapons & Armors Design was top tier for me."
Positive,"Got the tears from the Erlang Shen fight no cap. One of the best or the best game I've ever laid hands on to hands down. No dick riding what so ever. If you have the opportunity to buy this game, definitely go for it, 100/10 worth your money."
Positive,"I've been loving every second of this game so far, I read ""Journey to the West"" last year and I love seeing all the references and the mythology come to life.Gameplay is fantastic and fluid, just difficult enough to give me that sense of accomplishment. The graphics are beautiful and has me stopping and taking in the world."
Positive,Best game ever.
Positive,Reject modernityEmbrace monke
Positive,goat of the year 2024
Positive,"Good game because monkey.I do recommend this game if anyone is a fan of souls like and maybe bit of the new god of war titles the overall story is good the characters bosses and other enemy types are unique and refreshing your not fighting the same enemy in every chapter and that is a pass for me there piles of perks that will take a lot of time to level up and fully max out your character and the the design of your staffs and armour are very well detailed and crafted, you can also gain unique abilities (etc, Spells and transformations) that you can find and unlock through out the story, i'm not far into the game but i'm trying to get all the achievements cause It has been very addictive and i'm enjoying putting time into this game."
Positive,game is fucking amazing
Positive,monkey pole good
Positive,"Reject humanity, return to monke"
Positive,Funny monkey souls

Positive,MONKEEEEEEE.NG+ still enjoyable

Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is THE BEST game i have ever played till now. The narrative, the characters, the gameplay, the world design, everything is a deep appreciation to the epic tales of The Journey to the West, and the developer Game Science's take on the story of Sun Wukong  on his path to attain freedom, breaking the shackles of the celestial court imposed on him,  and to become the Victorious Fighting Buddha, aka the Monkey King.This game was an adventure to say the least, to be in the hide of the Destined one, and to experience the tales that the Great Sage has lived through, following his footsteps.The story is placed after the events of the Journey to the West, with the stories divided into six chapters, and each teaching us essential life lessons. We witness how many of the characters for the book are facing with emotional constraints: like greed, pride, lust, sorrow, loss, and many more; and how each chapter concludes with a very sweet and emotional music video made with different animation mediums to explore these emotional but moral teachings.Every moment I spent in this game has made me a witness of how rich and beautifully designed a game could ever be. Every details, designs, art direction are at their finest; and the higher form of narrative that the game revolves around makes me appreciate it even more. It's really hard to believe this was actually one of the first AAA games from China.Long story short, this game has become a very influential part of my life and have given me deep appreciation to the rich narrative stories and life lessons the tales from Journey to the West imparts on us.There had been rumours of this being a part of the Black Myth trilogy; with one rumoured to be Black Myth: Jiang Ziya. So if the other one turns out to be Black Myth: Nezha, you can count me to be in the front of the line and my sincere support to the Game Science team. "" Don't falter, Confront Destiny."""
Positive,GOTY right here. Great storytelling and even greater gameplay. 10/10

I've collected all 81 achievements, and I feel qualified to share my thoughts:A. Graphics: The visuals are truly a game-changer.B. Smoothness: The game features virtually no loading times, resulting in an incredibly smooth experience. (After defeating Erlang Shen, there was a brief lag of about 1-2 seconds. I suspect this was to prepare for the next epic battle, but overall, it's a clever design. The seamless experience is genuinely impressive.)C. Gameplay: Each player can develop their own unique fighting style. This action game emphasizes battling yaoguais and bosses, beautifully incorporating the essence of three stick stances from Chinese martial arts. Players who master these techniques can create combat scenes akin to those in martial arts films during boss fights, making them highly entertaining. Plus, you can transform into previously defeated bosses, further enriching the combat experience.D. Story: I recommend diving into the original Journey to the West, particularly Chapter 16 (The Guanyin Temple), Chapter 21 (The Yellow Wind Sage), Chapter 59 (Flaming Mountain), Chapter 65 (The Yellow Brow), and Chapter 72 (The Spider Cave). These chapters contain stories featured in the game, and knowing the source material can be beneficial when facing the final bosses.E. Creativity: One chapter places you in a miniature landscape that is, in reality, a tourist attraction. Trust me, even if you visit this tourist spot in Shanxi, China, you won't be able to appreciate the sculptural art up close as the game allows.F. Respected Boss: The boss designs are incredible. Many encounters won't feel tedious or grinding; instead, you'll find yourself eager to challenge them again after each defeat. My number one hardest boss is the Yellow Loong."
Positive,"It isn't sweet baby, so it's good for your health"
Positive,"Great story, fun gameplay definitely nice change from other games"
Positive,Monkey strong. Monkey Cool.
Positive,"One of the best games I've played so far, story needs some background to fully understand, but it's really good. Graphics are amazing, combat rewarding and satisfying, tho some of the bosses are pain in the ***. Overall gonna go for NG++"
Positive,"Between 7-8/10. The game is as good as god of war. It genuinely looks incredible. It plays pretty good. With minor exceptions the bosses are fair and usually can be beaten after changing your loadout. You don't have to farm and you can't ""outlevel"" your bosses like e.q. nearly every souls-like game.The game has huge technical problems that will lead to your cpu usage to be at 100% in certain places.It isn't perfect but still very fun and enjoyable.The hit- and hurtboxes are atrocious and even worse than dark souls 2, but still didn't take away the fun you can have fun with this game."
Positive,"I'm not into games that tell you nothing and just throw you in assuming you know what to do or where to go. Call me a what ever you want but bad design is bad design no way around it. I get the appeal like oh its ""difficult"" and you want to prove to yourself that you can beat it... of course you can given enough reattempts through trial and error. The ""Souls like"" genre simply doesn't respect your time in my opinion. Overall though the game is not bad if your into souls like games where the point is to waste your time learning each boss by dying multiple times just to learn the bosses kit and the immediately thrown into another boss not even 10 min later just to rinse and repeat learning the bosses kit. (sometimes you might beat a boss on the first try too which is nice change of pace)I'm only leaving a positive review because the game is actually not bad but it truly assumes you already know how to play the game right when you start which is crazy in my opinion...Just be ready to feel like your wasting your time half the time playing the game... if your into that sorta thing."
Positive,"Absolute peak gaming experience top 3 OAT the time and effort put into this game really shows. The music, cinematography, graphics are unmatched the built-in anime blew me away. I'm currently at the end of chapter 2 I am sad and happy the game is ending. What a game."
Positive,Who would have thought that an amazing boss rush game would have me so emotionally invested. 10/10 my game of the year! COMBAT PULLS YOU IN AND THE ACTUAL STORY OF WUKONG AND ZHU MAKES U GRIEVE AND CRAVE MORE
Positive,one of the few games that make me play it with joy and having fun not just play it bc you pay for it
Positive,Monkey business happening rn lowkey no cap.
Positive,Worth every of penny.Return to monke
Positive,Game made me stop playing fighting games (until i beat the game lol).Incredible game and so visual pleasing and pretty.Chinese Mythology such a cool theme and can't wait for the DLC.Going to win the GOTY fo sho fo sho.
Positive,"GOTY.I usually give up on Souls like games pretty quickly, but this game has me hooked!"
Positive,i love the guitarist from chapter 2 <3
Positive,Play as monkey... Monkey swings staff Monkey Dies over and over again!!
Positive,its pretty monke
Positive,"Secret ending is awesome, and the secret ending boss is hard.I'm going for 100% achievements, NG+ is a breeze with all the nice gear.I recommend this game, it has some flaws but it's a solid and fun experience."
Positive,"This game has so much raw unadulterated aura that I don't think anyone will benefit from yet another positive review but I'll write one anyway. While this game is strong in every pursuit, I think the gameplay stands out as particularly excellent. It feels buttery smooth and the animations have a beautiful weight and punchiness. Every input feels super responsive and the game supports a respectably diverse yet not overwhelming selection of fighting styles to toggle between. Additionally the boss variety, quantity, and quality are unequivocally unmatched. No other game comes close. This combined with the stellar graphics, world-building, and engaging story make this game an easy recommendation. You can feel the passion of the game developers seeping through this project and it's delightfully refreshing. 11/10 Amazing game"
Positive,FORGET MODERN GAMESRETURN TO MONKE
Positive,"Amazing game, some of the boss fights are nuts."
Positive,big stick go bonk very good
Positive,"The game is decent, def not as good as people hype it up to be."
Positive,"I, not really good at souls game, am enjoying this a lot."
Positive,Extremely impressive first game from this studio. They are a force in gaming now it's official. The amount of bosses in this game is nuts. I think the only downside in this game is invisible walls so exploration can seem artificial. I'd like this studio to make their version of an Elden Ring type game where players can go anywhere and do anything but I read they are planning on making two more games like this one. Oh well they are talented so I look forward to their next game.
Positive,"真的是一款不错的3A大作，值得推荐，没什么可挑剔，就后面的章节好像大于仓促，有点太赶了，其他的都还好，我没遇到什么big bug，就等待dlc 了，和更新优化It really is a good 3A masterpiece, worthy of recommendation, nothing to complain about, except that the later chapters seem to be a little too rushed, everything else is fine, I didn't encounter any big bugs, just waiting for the DLC and optimization update patches"
Positive,PURE CHINESE XINEMA
Positive,You can play this game
Positive,When was the last you learned about chinese mythology? Let alone play in one?In a sea of dead AAA and greedy companies. This stands strong on its own.
Positive,"Took me around 80 hours to do that, while the game itself took me around 60-65, but you can be sure I took my damn time and explored.Honestly, the game exceeded my expectations, gameplay wise, story wise, it's art and concept as a whole.I do not believe western studios could release a game like this yet, I don't even want them to. I have to give big kudos to devs for giving us a fun game, but also giving us a beam into eastern mythology, inspired by one of my favorite literature pieces, Journey to the West.I will keep this reviews  Spoiler Free  , but I also advise you to look up Sun Wukong and his story, because the game takes effect AFTER the events of Journey to the West. There are some deviations from the canon for plot purposes, but it's good to know the gist to understand some parts of the story being told, even the first sequence that you play. I am saying all of this, just to make your experience that much better.So.I'm actually pleasantly surprised how they captured essence of multiple games I love. Rest/Respawn as souls seriesStances as Ghost of TsushimaFlashy cinematic nature as GoW4 and Ragnarok Snappy hack n slash combat as DmCCompiling all of these elements and executed at this level, they compliment each other and just.. Work.You can also use Transformations and turn into Spirits, which is a pretty cool element I like, sometimes can be OP. But that's the thing.  You are meant to be OP.  Your enemies are aswell at times (I'll get to that in a bit), so why shouldn't you?Difficulty range is mid/high, prepare to struggle a bit, but the game expects you to adapt to situations, not just steamroll through. All abilities are REFUNDABLE, so don't be scared to change strategies and try something new. There are a handful hard bosses, but not to the levels of Souls series. About 3 bosses have a certain gimmick tied to first beating a secret area of a chapter, to obtain an item to help you with final bosses. But in general, all story bosses are Ok in difficulty. You won't be doing any 50+ attempt sit downs where a boss beats down all of your self confidence a leaves you with a strong urge to buy a rope. (I will not forget what you did Elden Ring DLC)Combat feels good and rewarding, 3 main play styles that allow you to experiment. BUT, as I said, don't get too comfortable, enemies especially later on can counter your tricks, so you will have to find a way to overcome their bs. Bosses are structured around you not abusing certain build, so It's good to get comfortable with as many mechanics as you can. I've played with every stance for 2 chapters, so I felt comfortable to switch any time. This way I beat most bosses in >5 attempts. Only one boss took me like 30+ attempts and another 10+ attempts (both are actually optional).Another element from Souls series, especially Elden Ring, that's here, is endless enemy combos. 8-10 chain hit attacks, like a damn ballerina hooked on angel dust spinning around you with no regard to your plans. Shat my pants multiple times, did not lose a single controller though.One thing I don't like is the lack of a map and world constructed in a way, that has a lot of invisible walls in places that ''seem'' like paths and then some paths I wouldn't expect to go to at first glance. That pushes a player like me to explore  everything  and that cuts some of the immersion. This can also impact you in a sense of secret areas. Devs literally hid some of the best content in these secret areas and are like ''the ultra cool shit is there, but I don't care if you find it bozo LMAO'' Like what. On one hand, that's based af, on another, I COULD'VE EASILY MISSED THAT?Even with the issue of no map and some weird terrain, this game is carried and excels through NUMEROUS bosses, 80+ actually, with almost all of them being totally different apart from 6 frogs, all fresh, all meat and potatoes, all action. Each chapter having new enemies, new elite enemies, new boss designs tied to chapter theme, just an absolute banger with variety.So easy 9/10Absolutely amazing story telling, each chapter has an animation as a reward and they are absolutely stunning. Each made by a different studio, telling stories, tying chapters up, even foreshadowing the next chapter that's coming. I'm glad gameplay wise they allow you to travel back to previous chapters, so you can finish remaining bosses and tie up loose ends.  I also STRONGLY advise for you to unlock the secret true ending.  (won't elaborate further)As I stated, this is After the novel, so it's a new story with core material being displayed in full and with pride. I refuse to elaborate for you on anything, better if you experience it yourself, for me for this aspect.It's a 10/10. Absolute Cinema I could be nerd yapping about all of the amazing compositions with strong oriental roots and cultural music instruments, all you need to know is, it slaps and it slaps hard. Thematically crafted, well put together with map concepts that compliment each other and immerse you further into this mystical universe. Most of the music is on streaming platforms, apart from 1 I couldn't find.2 pieces went straight into my playlist, both from boss fights.My ears are very grateful and won't need a fresh climax for a while. Another easy 10/10Have you seen the trailers or gameplay footage?  Do I even need to say more? I will only add that I couldn't play on max and I have an expensive PC, so I will throw some shade as a tantrum, because I'm petty.8.5/10Oh boy. This one, was some pain. Not an extreme challenge, but there are about 5 achievements that are just... UGH. Farming. Just a bunch of farming. Some of that farming is enemy farming, but a lot of that farming is plants farming. How does that kind of farming work you ask?Let me explain;>you pick up materials as ingredients for potions>there are 15 different ingredients to pick and each have a corresponding seed>you need to farm ALL of those seeds for an achievement>some of those ingredients can also drop passive items>which you also need to get ALL for another achievement >for these drops, you have a small chance, that you can't augment >farming locations have around 3-6 spots for ingredients, so 3-6 chances for a drop>  these locations respawn every 30 minutes Do you know how many runs I had to do? The pain I suffered? Out of those 96 hours I spent in this game till this review, around 10-15 of those were achievement hunting, dying on the inside, sometimes thinking that I'm crazy, that the wiki is wrong, that the gods conspired on me to never get my 100%, but in the end, I got it. Suck it, Celestial Court I refuse to rate this part, but it was Not my hardest 100%Game was an all around amazing experience, I don't give out 10/10 reviews, because I don't think a 10/10 game exists yet, but this one is high up there among my favorite games of all time and is an instant classic in my library. I really feel like this game is like if you gave an indie studio an infinite budget, for them to not hold back at all.It exceeded all my expectations, made me Rock Solid, brought me back to monke, made me emotional, further cultured my ahh and brought joy every time I escaped reality with this title.I also hear, that DLC is coming out in January next year as a part of Chinese New Years Celebration and I'm Rock Solid again as of mentioning this."
Positive,What a masterpiece!!
Positive,An art piece of a game that will live with me forever. I definitely recommend this epic.
Positive,i love this game
Positive,"Though some monsters and map design are so inhuman, but overall it's fun."
Positive,Game of the year
Positive,We used to get games like this back in the day when developers really cared about their products. It's rare to find games like this nowadays. I had an absolute blast with it and can’t wait to give this another shot! It was absolutely worth the money.
Positive,Game of the Year
Positive,"|^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \||___| The Truck of Approval |||""""'|""""\__,_| _______________ |||__|__|__|)|(@)@)""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""**|(@)(@)**|(@)"
Positive,the monkey is funny
Positive,"If I could give a ""mixed feelings"" review, I would. But unfortunately that doesn't quite exist and the positives still mostly outweigh negatives in this game, so it gets a thumbs up for me.There's a lot of depth in the combat. Unfortunately, while it feels like you start off fairly weak, you quickly ramp up to be unstoppable and I would imagine I died more times in any of chapter 1/2 than 3-5 combined. Obviously you can deliberately un-learn skills and use shitty gear, but what's the fun in that? Level design in this game also leaves a lot to be desired, this is especially obvious in chapter 3's prison section and chapter 4's cave section, where navigating the world is an absolute nightmare. It got so bad in chapter 5 that it's almost a completely linear path, with one off-branch for the hidden area and one main branch (that you cannot deviate from at all!) for the story.Negatives aside, though, the graphics are fantastic! Even just walking between points of interest proves to be an absolute treat for my eyes. I'm told that the optimization is middling for a AAA game, but perhaps that's just the norm nowadays. Music is also great, lots of Chinese instruments used with a more traditional style, which somewhat deviates from what people might be used to. One strange gripe is that lots of minibosses have fantastic soundtracks associated with them, but they die so quickly that I get banger music for like a minute, and it's back to regular programming again. The voice-acting is great, but the story's pacing can be a bit hit or miss. I thought chapter 3 in particular was annoyingly long with confusing story, while chapter 4's story was fantastic and packed into a medium-length map. While IGN fucks up a lot, I think they actually cooked with the 8/10 for Black Myth: Wukong. As the first AAA game that China produced, for it to even be compared with the greats like FromSoftware is very promising, hopefully this is the first of many many more to come."
Positive,All game companies can learn something from this
Positive,absoultely a masterpieace must buy
Positive,"Very well made game with a good amount of difficulty while not feeling impossible. Beating bosses is satisfying and the combat system flows well. Early on it is easy to dodge and evade most attacks and counterattack, later on bosses will have more complex attack patterns that will need a bit more patience to counter. The art style is beautiful and the animated shorts between chapters are a treat to watch. I would recommend this game to anyone it is an amazing experience and it is filled with content from top to bottom."
Positive,Definitely my game of the year!
Positive,"Not really care about TGA, this is my GOTY for sure."
Positive,"Writing after my first play through,I had high expectations for this game since it was surrounded by a lot of hype upon release. In my opinion it delivers. The presentation, graphics, music and story to this game are all 10/10's. I was highly immersed into my play through, which really kept me invested throughout. I enjoyed the aspect of sparks and skills in this game, I felt very rewarded as I leveled, and I highly recommend diving into new game plus upon completion, as you keep your skill progress, and feel satisfaction hammering on early bosses that once gave you trouble. I don't have many knocks on this game, I feel that some invisible walls seem to make the game feel clunky, and often times in boss fights they get me stuck in a corner with no escape. All in all this is a 9/10 game, game of the year candidate, and worth every penny I spent on it."
Positive,I can be monkey
Positive,เกมดี ภาพสวย สู้มันมาก ยากกำลังดีไม่มากไม่น้อย หักแค่ map design แย่กับกำแพงล่องหนเยอะ 9.5/10
Positive,"worth for the money , nice graphics nice story , nice fighting feeling ,"
Positive,DIDN'T DISAPPOINT!!!!! VERY GREAT GAME AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! WORTH BUYING!!!!
Positive,Very nice and complete game!
Positive,"This game is seriously stunning. The visuals are jaw-dropping, and the combat is a fun mix of strategy and skill. Boss fights are epic, though the difficulty can be all over the place. Sometimes you’ll breeze through an area, then get wrecked by a random boss. Although I was never a huge fan of souls-like games, but the ancient mythology theme and rich lore made it really enjoyable for me. #monke"
Positive,"I wholeheartedly recommend Black Myth: Wukong to any fan of Souls-like games. This title has become a true addiction for me. While some boss encounters have tested my patience, I recognize that it's more a matter of improving my own skill through trial and error. The game is a masterful work of art, inspired by the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, yet telling the story in its own unique and captivating way. Every scene, every battle, and every chapter is presented with such stunning visual spectacle that it's impossible not to be drawn in by its beauty. Rich in content, Black Myth: Wukong offers a deeply immersive experience, and with the anticipated DLC on the horizon, I’m eagerly looking forward to diving back in for more challenges and even greater adventures!"

Positive,"Top tier in terms of graphics, gameplay and storyline. GOTY-worthy!!!"
Positive,Great game....save yourself the money and don't by the edition.  Within 3 hrs the equipment is worthless.
Positive,Amazing game! Storyline is a little short but it is a top tier game I wish more were made like this!
Positive,"amazing, or should i say zaebis sukaoverall solid 9/10"
Positive,"Feel so inspired by the journey so I've completed all the 81 challenges in the path of enlightenment.Liked the game. It has great cutscenes with good production. The picture is beautiful and well optimized for mid-tier hardware.The bosses are BIG. They all aren't difficult to beat but have good design with some exceptions)The fights and combat talents are diverse and interesting but I can say that maybe half of them are really useful.Only level design of the midgame left some odd feelings for me. I think they might be better and more interesting. Overall, Its fun to play!Also really enjoyed the NG+ run with skipping almost all optional activities :)"
Positive,Game of the decade. Hands down
Positive,"I just beat this game and let me tell yall, this is peak."
Positive,Very good game if you want to break your whole setup
Positive,"Never been a fan of Souls Like games, meaning jumping from boss fight to boss fight. But this game changed my perspective on this kind of genre. Best game of the year by FAAAR."
Positive,"Reject modernity, embrace monke"
Positive,Great Game! 10/10.
Positive,Perfect in every way imaginable.
Positive,Candidate for GOTY
Positive,Any game that has a main menu which changes as you progress through the game is good in my book.
Positive,"*Black Myth: Wukong* is nothing short of a masterpiece in the action RPG genre. From the moment you step into its world, you're captivated by the stunning visuals that bring ancient Chinese mythology to life in ways rarely seen in gaming. The combat is incredibly fluid and satisfying, demanding both strategy and skill, making every battle feel like an epic encounter."
Positive,Art & Presentation：10分。除了部分LOD glitching之外，画面无可挑剔。SFX：7分。一些冷门乐器例如唢呐的加入很创新，但总体而言比较平淡，没有记忆点。Core Game Play：8.5分。机制设计的不错，总体而言很有趣。Boss Fight：8分。 难度一般，90% boss都是一把过，但部分粪怪让我破防，抬手前摇很不明显。Map design：6分。在线性地图里算得上是胡乱设计，搞得跟迷宫一样。Story Telling：7.5分。改编的剧情马马虎虎吧，无感。总体而言不错，打8分。作为一个ACT游戏存在不少瑕疵，整个工业水平和顶尖大作还是差了点距离，再接再厉。
Positive,"Very nice game, amazing graphic and gameplay, Before you buy though, the only negative thing is that it's pretty hard for me, you need to know how to play these kind of games. Not as difficult as elden ring, but still pretty difficult to master.."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a must-play for anyone interested in a captivating narrative, thrilling combat, and stunning visuals. It's a true contender for Game of the Year sets a new benchmark for what's possible in the world of gaming"
Positive,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!BEST GAMES OF THE YEAR!Strongly recommend! Can't wait for the future DLCs!
Positive,"You play as  monkey struggling to find food, you find it and a really big stick."
Positive,"I don't usually replay a game. But in this one, I missed one OPTIONAL boss that doesn't effect any end-game outcome and I didn't even think hitting that New Game+ button.+ Immersive graphics+ Good battle system+ EPIC COLOSSAL BATTLE in near end-game which is wayyy crazier than the final boss itself (the fact that YOU CAN ACTUALLY MISS THIS if you just go straight to main story just blew my mind)+ Awesome story line- A map wouldn't hurt, though- I played too much Genshin I actually hoped for better soundtracks (like, the orchestrated/philharmonic ones)Very worth for its price, even in full. Get it."
Positive,"Beautiful game at times, some weird lighting and shading effects sometimes. Well put together, can't believe it actually ended up coming out. Play if you like lots of epic boss battles, not easy, challanging at times."
Positive,GOTY for me so refreshing to have something to play that is both fun and challenging.
Positive,Good classic fun not too difficult not really a souls like so don't get turned away if you're not into those
Positive,"only one or 2 bosses might make you want to uninstall the game, so its not hard like a souls-like. the story is amazing and told in a clear way. (Not like elden ring) This game is a must play if you like souls-like games and  god of war. 10/10"
Positive,"As a long-time fan of mythological tales and action RPGs, I approached Sun Wukong: Black Myth with a mixture of excitement and skepticism. Developed by Game Science, this title takes inspiration from the classic Chinese epic, Journey to the West, and reimagines it as a high-octane, visually stunning action game. Having spent several hours traversing its beautifully rendered world, I’m ready to share my thoughts.Visuals and Atmosphere:From the moment you boot up Sun Wukong: Black Myth, you’re greeted with a visual feast. The game boasts an incredibly detailed environment that brings the rich lore of Chinese mythology to life. The character models, particularly Sun Wukong himself, are exquisitely designed, showcasing a high level of craftsmanship in both animation and texture. The dynamic weather effects and lighting add an extra layer of immersion, making the game’s world feel vibrant and alive.Gameplay and Mechanics:The core gameplay of Sun Wukong: Black Myth is a mix of fast-paced combat and exploration, with a heavy emphasis on melee action. The combat system is fluid and responsive, allowing players to chain together combos with ease. Sun Wukong’s ability to transform into various forms adds a unique strategic element to battles. Each form offers different abilities, encouraging players to adapt their tactics based on the situation.However, while the combat is exhilarating, it’s not without its flaws. The enemy AI can sometimes feel inconsistent, with some opponents being overly aggressive while others are surprisingly passive. Additionally, the game’s difficulty spikes can be a bit jarring, particularly for players who might be less familiar with action RPGs.Story and Characters:The narrative of Sun Wukong: Black Myth is both intriguing and somewhat uneven. The game draws heavily from the mythos of Sun Wukong, weaving a story that is both grand and intimate. The lore is rich, and the voice acting adds depth to the characters. However, the plot can occasionally feel disjointed, with some story beats lacking the emotional impact they might otherwise have.Performance and Technical Aspects:On PC, Sun Wukong: Black Myth runs smoothly, provided you have a reasonably powerful rig. The game’s graphics are demanding, but if your system meets the requirements, you can expect a mostly stable experience. There are occasional frame rate dips during intense sequences, but these are generally minor and don’t detract significantly from the overall enjoyment.Final Thoughts:Sun Wukong: Black Myth is a visually impressive and engaging action RPG that offers a fresh take on a beloved mythological figure. Its combat system is both fun and challenging, and the world-building is top-notch. However, it does have some rough edges, particularly in terms of enemy AI and narrative cohesion. For fans of mythological stories and action games, it’s definitely worth checking out. With some polishing, it has the potential to become a true classic.If you’re ready to dive into a world of gods, demons, and epic battles, Sun Wukong: Black Myth is a journey you won’t want to miss. Just be prepared for a few bumps along the way."
Positive,"not as hard as soul-like, but enough challenging for a 3x like me, and very addicted since Western story about Sun Wukong is continued as a darker version for karmahighly recommend"
Positive,"The synergy between art directors and developers with budget and creative freedom resulting in such a masterpiece. graphical downgrade is generous and understandable, music is good and Character design from looks to actions of every single NPC to main character is beautiful and unique. Game got sleek combat and responsive moves, Even though game recommends to use controller, keyboard and mouse are fine and responsive over controller. This game is a reminder of how games used to be and should be and a milestone in gaming industry for sure. Even though they used some Unreal engine 5 shortcuts they have put effort in different aspects....respect for that (this is not your regular lazy half-a$$ed UE5 Preset game), Looking forward to the DLC."
Positive,Amazing 10/10 would recommend. Mind-blowing story and smooth gameplay. Greatness and should be GOTY!
Positive,"Well, should I even say anything?"
Positive,What a game. Enjoyed till the end. I like the pacing and the length of the game. Not too long yet not too short. Also the episodic structure makes each levels feels more manageable. Satisfying combats that leaning toward to fast pace and attack speed. Unique Bosses mechanics from the start till the end. Explorations are rewarded appropriately which accompanied by beautiful levels and environmental designs.

Positive,"I'll be really upset if this doesn’t win 'GOTY 2024.'Game Science has delivered one of the best AAA action RPG experiences in recent years of disappointments from many other big developers out there. This game is a wake-up call to the entire gaming industry: More game, less ""woke"", No microtransaction nonsense.I completed the game with 100% journal completion and defeated every single boss, including the secret ones. They nailed it in every way—beautiful graphics, fluid animations, stunning music, great voice acting, and incredible environmental design.Hats off to Game Science.◾GraphicsBeautiful. They did an amazing job here.◾GameplayVery good. Monkey business done right—9/10.◾Audio**Very good.**👌 The sound effects, especially the whoosh of a perfect dodge, are incredibly satisfying.◾PC RequirementsHigh-end. You’ll need a strong rig to fully appreciate the stunning environments.◾DifficultyVery challenging. Patience is key. You need to enjoy and embrace every fight to get the most out of the game.◾GrindExtensive skill tree. If you want to maximize your gameplay experience, improving your skill tree is essential. This requires grinding through high-experience enemies as much as possible.◾StoryRich and immersive. The storyline might be tricky for some to follow, but having knowledge of the novel Journey to the West and the lore of Sun Wukong and his allies enhances the experience. Game Science did a fantastic job creating an original continuation of the classic story.◾Game TimeAround 40+ hours.◾PriceAbsolutely worth it. They deserve all the praise for delivering such an amazing product.◾BugsVery minor. Nothing that affects the gameplay."
Positive,"10/10! Beautiful graphics, engaging and challenging game play. I have always loved Wukong as a character and this has been a wonderful adventure so far."
Positive,Reviewed on A RTX 7900 XTX. Ryzen 7950. 64 GB of DDR 5 and the best SSD you can get. Every review of this game with political bias favoritism is wrong. All I can say is Thank you. This is better than I ever imagined it could have been. An absolute Cinema experience that fired on all Cylinders like dual wielding revolvers with infinite ammo. From The masterful gameplay that was engaging and fast paced. To the Insane graphics and environmental design. Not enough Diversity? What a joke that is huh? There is plenty of diversity in this game. With interesting characters each with their own designs and personalities. Bosses with insane movesets and interesting combat abilities. Different weapon and build diversity for unique creativity. Changing the combat and evolving the experience. Respec is also free which is unheard of and such a breath a fresh air. Its a 10 Folks. Its not even a question. Its not up for debate. 10/10 Worth full price. Multiple playthroughs. The ending fights were absolutely diabolical as well. I was literally holding my skull waiting for it to explode from the fights themselves and the absolute cinema involved.
Positive,"Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a remarkable achievement in game design. Its stunning visuals, challenging combat, and rich storytelling make it a must-play for fans of action-adventure games. Despite some technical hiccups and a steep learning curve, the game’s strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. If you’re looking for an immersive and visually captivating experience, Black Myth: Wukong is definitely worth your time"
Positive,Monke strongGame fun
Positive,"slight hard, interesting story, challenging, not pay to win"
Positive,"Game is very inspiring and very beautiful, and the combat is very smooth . 10/10 game for me"
Positive,Good Game Be Monke JumpAttack with stick get triggered after dying by a giant kid repeatring 3 belltry to beat golden giant kid it heals restart again continue the game get disrespected by last boss quit the game ezbut good game ngl
Positive,"Honestly Game of the Year 2024.  This is what Triple A gaming at 60$ should deliver! And I agree, this sends a big message to Budding Chinese Developers and Worldwide that Singleplayer games ARE PROFITABLE. With how prevalent Gacha Games and Online games are, Hopefully this is a wake up call to invest more into this instead of Gacha and the like.  As for the challenge, since im no Dark Souls fan, im more of Different Difficult Game fan (mostly rhythm games) however, this is properly paced and balanced. There are times where camera and weird large AOE hitboxes are frustrating to deal with but the defensive options are very lenient. Havent encountered a boss that took me more than 10 tries to take out. Especially I want to share the Peak moment was (SPOILERS) when I fought the Heavenly Kings and the fight blurred between Cinematic and Gameplay and everything flowed so smoothly. It was an experience! A few nitpicks tho like getting from point A to point B is pretty slow. especially when chapter map sizes open up. The need for the Mount which is the Cloud should've been there early at least. Encountered a bug where a higher quality in Global Illumination, turns off sun shadows and lighting unless I pick it at low. I wish the lore bits in the journal are just descriptive of why and how the characters are what they are instead of some story snippets."
Positive,Return to monke
Positive,game of the year
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is shaping up to be a truly remarkable game, blending stunning visuals with deep, engaging storytelling.  The attention to detail in every aspect, from the breathtaking environments to the fluid character animations, is nothing short of extraordinary.  The developers have beautifully captured the essence of classic Chinese mythology, bringing the legendary tale of the Monkey King to life with modern technology.The combat system feels smooth and dynamic, offering a challenging yet rewarding experience.  Every battle is filled with strategy and excitement, allowing players to harness Wukong’s unique powers and abilities in innovative ways.  The variety of enemies, each with distinct characteristics and styles, keeps every encounter fresh and immersive.What stands out the most is the sheer ambition of the game.  It not only pushes the boundaries of what action RPGs can be, but it also serves as a love letter to the rich cultural history that inspired it.  Black Myth: Wukong is set to become a new benchmark for storytelling, visual fidelity, and gameplay in the gaming world.  This is a game that fans of both mythology and action RPGs absolutely cannot miss."
Positive,"I absolutely loved this game! Is it a perfect game? No it has it's issues here and there. But those issues meant nothing as I played through the game! It was a fun adventure beginning to end and it was hard to put down everyday I just wanted to keep on going. Captivating environments, characters, story and the music absolutely slaps! The boss fights all felt different enough that the game always felt fresh. The combat was satisfying and skill tree was great and diverse enough to create different kinds of builds. Also, the fact that you can reassign your skill points whenever you want was such a relief. I could not recommend this game enough it is a MUST PLAY!"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a great game, but it has too much flaws to be considered amazing. Tons of bosses, but none is truly memorable. The story-telling is not great too. The command inputs have some problems as well.Don't get me wrong, it's a great action-game inspired by souls games. You will have fun.If you like FromSoftware's games, you will think this game is easy. Really, the only bosses that start to be difficult are the last two. But if you don't play/like souls games, this game will be challenging and fun. I recommend buying if it's on sale!Probably GOTY 2024 tho.7/10"
Positive,"The story is very good.  It can work quite well as a possible sequel to the original Journey to the West     Overall graphics, design of characters and all aesthetics related material are actually quite good, I like it, even the low graphics setting is pretty solid     The gear, and the ability to get the mats are not too bad.  If you take the time to explore.  You will be able to mostly craft a decent amount of armor sets near end game.  I think I was able to create at the very least 2 - 3 sets before NG.     Combat is not too shabby either, with a but....will be in the ""What I don't like/prefer to see change""     One of the biggest things that I recognized almost immediately is the lack of a map, having a map would've been so helpful in exploring these huge maps and areas.  Especially since each chapter is quite long.     I personally would've preferred that leveling increased your attack and defense, maybe not every level but maybe every other level or two at the least.  Some bosses just do so much damage.  And if your someone like me that has a bit of a slow brain and takes time to adjust to these attack timings, it would've really helped alot.     Now for the combat, I think that for the most part like mentioned above its not bad.  You have light attacks, dodging, heavy attacks and the usual.  But what I experienced at least is, sometimes the game will not respond to some of my commands and I will have pressed that hotkey...exaggerating....like a bazillion times.  Like space bar for dodge.  And there were some bosses were my lock on would randomly disappear on its own.  Not for when bosses fly high in the sky or something.  Like it would be when its just regular combat near/on the ground.  Whether this is a bug or my PC I don't know.  But this is what I am experiencing.     No mana regen mechanic other then a poor restore rate using gourd.  This lowkey ruins the game for me.   CPU: Intel i7-9700K    GPU: NVidia Geforce RTX 3080 10GB Founders Edition   RAM: Corsair Vengeance 32GB"
Positive,DLC IS A MUST !!
Positive,"best game ive ever played, this game is a must play! im also really looking forward to the DLC and much more!!"
Positive,"Finally a working game on release. This Game has a incredible cinematic story line, stunningly beautyfull World Graphics and good challenging Fights with different combat styles. Its absolut fun would recommend it 10/10"
Positive,MONKEE = gud gaym
Positive,Man brain like monkey hit things 10/10
Positive,"After playing 30 hours of Wukong, I can happily say that it is one of the best action combat games that I've played in many years and I look forward to completing the game. I'm writing my review now because I want people to know that this is a must pickup title to add to your collection. If you enjoyed God of War (2018 Version and I've not played Ragnarok) then you will most certainly love Wukong. They both play similarly and pose equally engaging fights with a beautifully crafted zoned-world."
Positive,"Amazing. Souls-like with recent God of War progression. Makes dying less punishing than souls games. More ""boss rush"" than souls games, MAJOR + for me. Simple, philosophical story that is presented in a clear way, no need for any youtube lore videos here. ""Trash"" mobs are interesting without being annoying or overstaying their welcome before getting to the next boss. Overall pacing between bosses is much better than souls game IMO. I tend to bounce off souls games after getting annoyed at a trap room or a sequence of trash mobs. Not a problem here for me."
Positive,"I bought it thinking it was going to be a so called ""action game"" found out it is a souls game as in the amount of damage you take from a hit is crazy (not one shot at least). Refunded cause I didnt want that kind of stress anymore (played and finished elden ring previously), still bought the game back again and tried again this time just watching and waiting for enemy moves, suddenly it became easier. I mean still almost broke my controller a few times but this is a 10/10 game."
Positive,"Stunning visuals with incredible detail and fluid animations. The fast-paced, *Souls-LIKE combat is rewarding,Playing on Ryzen 9 laptop with RTX 3070, running at 1920p with DLSS on high settings, the game consistently delivers 60 FPS, which is really smooth and impressive."
Positive,"I've beaten the game twice, and have 100%'ed it just yesterday, so my opinions are still fresh.This game is weird for me, it's great, you can tell how much love and passion was put into this game, arguably one of the most passionate games I've ever played, there's a lot of minute detail in the lore, story, characters, secret dialogue, and secrets. Alas, despite all of that, it feels like a game that struggles with it's identity.It tries to be a souls-like with it's core mechanics, has DMC-like style switching, yet it doesn't excel at either; the souls mechanics are out of the window since it only really borrows perfect dodging and parrying (which in this case, it's pretty much like Sekiro), stamina doesn't really matter because you get an absurd amount of recovery and bar, that it doesn't matter 95% of the time, unlike the souls games having stamina management part of the core gameplay. It tries to have style switching like DMC, but the skill tree for those 3 styles you get in the game are disappointingly not that complex, it basically just unlocks 1 extra move for each stance, and the rest of the skills for that specific stance is basically just things like making it hit harder, launch charged attacks faster, or do something niche like drinking your gourd on a staff or doing a light attack finisher with less than 1 focus. Due to the lack of actual combos and it mostly just being a spam spells and attack button game, I didn't feel as captivated.The bosses are great, albeit most of them I beat without feeling the satisfaction of learning them properly and finally beating them like in the souls games, specifically Elden Ring and Lies of P have really difficult, amazing bosses that force you to learn them properly to succeed, where-as in this game you get so many easy to access tools to deal damage that you can face-tank a lot of bosses, not to mention most bosses don't have many moves to learn, it's like fighting a dark souls 2 boss.Of course, not all bosses are easy or just a plot obstacle, I was very impressed by Yellow Loong, the final boss and secret final bosses of the game, they were all amazing and noteworthy, I sincerely hope if they do release a DLC they make more bosses that rely more on your combat skills and understanding of the mechanics rather than face-tanking and spamming spells to win.The OST is great, it's nothing to write home about, but it's not amazing either, it felt a bit too cinema-y for me to enjoy it, like it was written and composed for the main purpose of it being a first time experience type of OST, there's a few outliers of course. I enjoyed the Shangxi headless Buddha singing a ton! It gave chapter 2 a very ethereal and awesome feel that I cannot describe, and I wish more songs were like that, but it is what it is.As for the story; as someone who isn't all that familiar with Journey to the West, it felt incredibly lacking. It's a heavily story focused game, and it assumes you have preconceived notions and knowledge regarding the story, which in turns makes it much harder for someone like me (and many people too, who don't know much about the novel) to feel left out and confused the majority of the time. The journal doesn't help that much either because it's just 10 paragraphs of reading that *also* assumes you know what a lot of chinese terms mean. The God of War and Hades franchises are based on mythology and delve extremely deep into it, but they are able to teach someone who is not at all familiar with their lore a ton of history, unlike Black Myth Wukong. I also wish the Destined One (player character) talked, it's a game that has just as much story, lore, characters just as there is combat, when Sun Wukong talked in chapter 5 in the music video, it was really fucking cool, because he seems like such a complex character, and then you have us, the player character... We have no personality, no clear goals besides the one we are told to do, no inner conflicts, no anything at all. The crumbs I got with the face expressions I got I appreciated, but it's such an incredibly missed opportunity to just make us this mute, random monkey that doesn't do literally anything for himself. If we talked like Sun Wukong or Bajie the story would've been elevated 10x more.Off-topic, the developers are also weird. They are incredibly misogynistic in their statements and it also shows in the game where the women are always degraded or used to hit on them (specifically Bajie that keeps doing that, it's annoying as fuck, takes away from his character at the end of chapter 4 when you realize he's just been a misogynistic asshole for 3 chapters straight). Because of that, this game unfortunately didn't land with me as it should have, I always had a sour taste of my mouth when playing it, but it's still a great game to come out of China, and I hope they improve on a lot of things.TL;DR Combat is okay, not amazing. Story is very confusing for non-readers. OST is great. Bosses are very fun regardless of difficulty or rather lack-thereof. Secrets and exploration is amazing. 7/10 game"
Positive,"A very good game, short of excellence by not much.Negatives:-Some input lags (very frustrating when it happens)-Slightly disapointing level design-Lacking in weapon variety-Some disapointments in environment's art directionPositives:-Despite the second negative, combat is very satisfying and offers a lot with the spells, abilities and summons.-A great universe exploring a great myth that was not explored like that before in video game (at least not on that scale)-Great character/creature designs (both mecanically and art wise)-Interesting story with very good animated cutscenesIf you liked God of War, you will surely like this game!"
Positive,"What an incredible game. I haven’t felt the want to finish a game that badly in a long time; and do as many of the achievements and things I can along the way. The combat feels great once you understand how to use the different stances together, along with spells and spirits. The story is amazing, and makes me want to watch the 1986 show and listen to the audiobook to really understand everything. That being said, Chapter 6, and one other boss in Chapter 4 are not great. The Scorpionlord, a secret boss in chapter 4, along with the first and the final bosses of the Chapter 6, just feel very unfun. There’s a lot of flying and moving and the game takes what you’ve learned through the entire game and throws it all away and even punishes you for it. Along with that, Chapter 6 feels very unfleshed and is the first instance where you see copy/paste bosses (because they are literally the same), granted they are mini bosses. In any case, I still loved this game and my time with it. I plan on going through and doing at least NG+, as there are a couple missables and I don’t think I’m that tired of the game just yet.I’d rate this a solid 8.5 or 9 out of 10 for me. Incredible, fantastic, fair (except for a few instances), thrilling, and length feels great. I am excited for a future DLC!"

Positive,"The game is great, it is not a souls clone, it is more of a mix between souls and GoW."
Positive,GOTY 2024 or we riot
Positive,"Game is looks fantastic and being able to respec monke whenever to try new things is a great way to feel like you are not powerless against some of the toughest enemies. Also, monke is handsome."
Positive,Absolutely STUNNING graphics and fun combat loop. I have no regrets for 100% the game and entering ng+.
Positive,This game changed my perspective on life. Now I want to evolve back into being a monke again.
Positive,Excellent but im a dark souls fan.this is more ''boss rush'' style than ''explore to find boss'' stylevery fun but got tedious over too many boss's and very little exploration.10/10 knowing its not my style of game.
Positive,"I'd highly recommend this. The combat is very fluid and pairs amazingly with the use of spells. If you're an achievement hunter, heavily explore everywhere and collect everything.  You'll probably need a guide to collect the Curios, Soaks and Armor drops. There is nothing to tell you who drops what in the game.  Overall, This game is extremely enjoyable. It is difficult at times, but not unfair. Good timing is a requirement."
Positive,"Best game i have ever played in my life. sooo good, highly recommend to everyone. holy shit so good"
Positive,"""After Journey to the west story "" This game is great, you guys should try this game. It's not too hard, especially when you have defeated the boss in game of from software :)) this game is chill :))"
Positive,APE SOULS..... 10/10
Positive,Got a prebuilt recently at BestBuy and saw I got a free game came with it and thought oh thats neat... little did I know I was getting an absolute masterpiece. I was absolutely obsessed with this game when it released and can't wait to get back to playing it.

Positive,"Writing this 30 hours in, currently on chapter 5 and have never played a game of this genre, certainly hard for those who have never experienced a game like this before coming from my perspective.The developers have done an excellent job on graphic design, story telling and the music from chapter 2 is beyond amazing. I would 100% say this is not a game you can spend only an hour on at a time you need a minimum of 2-3 and personally this is not a game you play to relax if your around the yellow loong stage 😂 Still some slight bugs and glitches from what I've noticed but it's to be expected from a new release.Tip I would also say is to download to your internal storage devise (C drive) as it allows the game to run much smoother and also allows it to load faster.Overall I would recommend and rate it a solid 10/10."
Positive,"I recently had the pleasure of diving into ""Black Myth: Wukong,"" and I must say, it stands out as a breath of fresh air in the souls-like genre. While many games in this space are known for their punishing difficulty, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" offers a more casual experience that still retains thrilling combat and exploration.The gameplay feels fluid and accessible, allowing me to fully enjoy the stunning visuals and intricate world design without being stuck in a loop of frustration. The combat mechanics are engaging, with a variety of moves and combos that make each encounter feel unique. What truly sets ""Black Myth: Wukong"" apart is its captivating storytelling and rich cultural references, drawing from the classic tale of the Monkey King. The game beautifully integrates myth with action, resulting in an experience that’s both entertaining and thought-provoking.Overall, if you’re a fan of souls-like games but prefer a more casual approach, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a must-play. The blend of accessibility and depth makes it not just a worthy competitor, but in my opinion, an even better experience than other souls games. Highly recommend it!8.5/10"
Positive,"Story 6/10I love games with solid stories. This game is based on the Chinese mythological story called ""Journey to the west"". I actually spoke to many Chinese people about this to see if they knew it, and every one of them did. It seems to be a massive story, and I have no doubt that this game done a great job of showing it, but to someone who is not Chinese, I had a hard time telling what was happening. It was good from what I had understood but I didn't really understand most of it. I couldn't relate to why certain events were happening. That said, I do like Chinese mythology. I knew some of the characters in this such as Erlang Shen, and Sun Wukong, obviously. I also saw a scene with Ne Zha and some others and I liked this, even though I didn't know what was happening.Controls 9/10These types of games usually have clunky control systems, but actually this was very smooth to play. Default controls were perfect, and it never felt unnatural to use any of it.  Camera views were never really an issue either. I think I have an issue at one point in the game. There was a certain boss on the last chapter. It had multiple hit boxes and for some reason the game automatically switched the hitbox I was looking at . It was quite frustrating having to keep taking it off and on again.Mechanics 9/10The main way of attacking is through your staff. Melee attacks are straight forward. Your different stances do change things up a little bit, but not much. Very simple to learn. Spells add a nice addition to combat. You don't have to use them, but they do change the play style of a bit. To be honest, I didn't even use that many of them. Certain ones just suited my play style more. You have a big selection of transformations as well, which also nicely plays in with Wukong's lore of having many transformations. Each one provides a different play style on limited time. The healing in game was the only frustrating part. It takes sooooo long to use a heal. I understand this plays into the difficulty, but when bosses are so aggressive you really can't get a moment to finish the healing animation sometimes.Graphics 9/10This was simply beautiful. It might be one of the best looking games out there. It's the only time my PC hasn't ran a game at full specs. There was one issue with it. The game requires 16GB ram as a minimum, but this is also the required amount. I have 16GB and I'm going to say that you need more than this. The game literally uses all 16GB. In chapter 3 you will get some frame drops in certain areas, and for this reason I'm going to have to take a point off it.Audio 10/10The audio is what you expect; really good. Each area has it's atmosphere filled perfectly with the audio. There are audio cues in game, and you might not think about them at first, but they're letting you know something is nearby. It didn't even pick up on that until my second play-through. You can dodge enemy attacks by listening to the audio as well.Difficulty and design 8/10I call these types of games the ""git gud"" games. You can't just push your way through them. It is difficult. Some bosses really didn't seem that bad, but you let your guard down and then you get a boss that just kills you so much. There was one boss on chapter 2 that I died to around 30 times I'm sure. Stay level headed and you'll beat it. You can play with a passive play style or aggressive. Both play styles will be better against different bosses.Overall 8/10This game was very enjoyable. I managed to 100% it on play through 3. Some bosses were frustrating but there was no point where I wasn't enjoying myself. From start to finish I just had such a great time playing this. Can't wait for the DLC to come."
Positive,If invisible walls piss you off then you're gonna be pissed off constantly. But the game is very good in many areas so the invisible walls stop being much of a problem.
Positive,"Reject humanity, return to monke."
Positive,Попа болит нормально так

Positive,The game already looks so good and we are returning back to MONKEY!
Positive,"100% game of the year, thank you game science for this masterpiece"
Positive,"Absolutely fantastic, a beautiful Chinese odyssey of monkey king ""Sun Wukong"". Glad that the developers are staying true to the novel and insert many traditional cultural themes (object, landmark and traditonal chinese customs). This is what a game should be, just pure fantasy without any agenda of any sort."
Positive,"Well, after almost 60 hours of battling my way through this game... I can wholeheartedly recommend it. Had a blast from start to finish, except for those few bosses that made me rage so hard I nearly invented new curse words. But hey, the sweet taste of victory was worth it !"
Positive,"Monke go crazy, Monke smash"
Positive,"If reincarnation is real, playing this game makes me want to be Chinese in my next life.10/10"
Positive,Literally the best game I have touched. Damn China
Positive,Easy Souls-like game but better graphic!
Positive,In all my years of using steam I have never bought a game however this cycle was ended by Black Myth: Wukong. I highly recommend purchasing this game! To the Devs keep up the phenomenal work!
Positive,"I love this game, even though I am 1.6 hours in due to my game crashing, which is most likely because I am on a laptop, and not an optimized PC, the game is still entertaining, and the lag due to my laptop just makes it funnier, it is sad that I can't get screenshots of when I crash though, I think sharing those frames would be funny"
Positive,"As a Chinese from Malaysia I'm really proud I do understand What this game meaning and the story , and I do like how the game fight so well and the effect was so good . But almost a month i experience still the same bug like the boss will stuck somewhere and i just don need dodge and easily kill it ... hahaha . overall it is so good , recommend to everyone ."
Positive,"This was my first time playing a Souls-like/GoW/whatever game. I bought this game, because I love the story of Journey to the West and Sun Wukong. After my second boss, I thought I would immediately rage quit this game. But, after committing over 20 attempts at it, I finally realized what made this game so fun. Learning each boss, exploring each area fully, finding secrets, and upgrading Wukong has honestly made this one of the most addicting games I've ever played. I'm only on Chapter 3/6, but I know by the end I will want more. Highly recommend this to anyone who is up for a great challenge. 10/10 game for me, definitely worth the purchase."
Positive,"This is the first review I've done since I created my steam account. The game is so good it compelled me to do so. Black Myth: Wukong is a great AAA game, with great action and beautiful, stunning visuals. The main draw of the game is, of course, the action. You have a simple, yet highly engaging and effective combat system. The main combat flow is to use light attacks to fill your Focus gauge and use Focus Points to unleash powerful heavy attacks. Your main defensive option consists in dodging incoming attacks. If you do exactly at the right time, you do a Perfect Dodge, earning Focus, slowing time down and opening counter attack windows. I can't stress how Perfect Dodge makes the combat that much more engaging, allowing extreme aggressiveness on your part. You know the game is good when you can enter That ""State of Mind"", where everything you do is just perfect and flows beautifully, you dodge every move perfectly, your Focus gauge is always up, you don't leave any room for breathing, you just Are. You also can mix up with a limited amount of versitile spells that can stop enemies in time or parry hits.Wukong's main ability was his 72 Transformations, and the game revels in this lore. You have access to a variety of transformative spells as well, that allow you to take form of plenty of NPCs you meet in your Journey. Spirit Summons also work the same way, albeit with a short transform time. The sheer number of transformations works to spice up the already perfect combat. Overall, 10/10 for combat.The visuals and artistic design are breathtaking. Chinese mythology nerds like me are crying tears of joy. This game is a work of art, literally. Every scenery, every sound, every character, every voice acting, every tiny little pixel of this game works phenomenally to bring that unique Chinese myth vibe to life and does so in a spetacular way. Forrest, valleys, deserts, moutains, every region that encompasses Chinese mythology is extremely well represented here, with stunning graphics.Performance-wise, I've had a few issues. I played on a RTX4070, with cinematic graphics (the highest), DLSS and hardware acceleration on and ray tracing off at 1080p. I've managed to hit a constant and stable 70FPS throughout the game while enjoying the beautiful graphics. With medium ray tracing on, however, even the second highest grpahics couldn't reach stable 60FPS. I've also had some few graphic bugs while playing, such as textures not loading properly during cutscenes, frame drops, and the main menu freezing/bugging out and main opening cutscene not playing. Nothing major, as far as I'm concerned, but your mileage may vary. Overall, 10/10 for graphics and artistic design, that goes down to a 8.5/10 due to some performance issues that hopefully will be patched.The level design is good, but it is severely hindered by the lack of a map or any tool to direct you and the dreaded invisible walls. While you can speedrun chapters by just going through a straight line to the end of the chapter, later maps offer a variety of different paths to explore, bosses to fight, items to discover and pills to ingest to strengthen your character and NPC questlines, so exploration is highly encouraged. However, without any sort of map, it is extremely easy to get lost, and the choice of limiting exploration with invisible walls offers a lot of frustation to the player. This could be circumvented by applying any other technique to limite player movement, such as actual physical walls or trees or anything else. However, you eventually get used to it. This is the game's main weakness, but it wasn't any deal breaker for me. 9.5/10 for good content in the maps, that gets down to 7/10 because exploring isn't that great.This game is just great. I honestly think the price tag is worth it, There are a handful of games I've paid full price and bought it on release. This was one of them and it was worth every single bit. I've enjoyed every second I've spent in game.What really compelled me to write this review is that this is the first game I've played that I could actually feel that was a work of love. You know the developers love the Journey to the West story, that they love their culture, that they pulled every bit of their souls into creating something they actually love. The mythology and culture is treated with so much respect, so much beauty, so much passion. There are Music Videos after each chapter is completed that retells a story, and each MV is done in a different artstyle. I felt it out-of-place initially, but then it dawned on me that the game is a love letter from chinese people to traditional chinese culture. It was very touching.My final rating is 10/10. Is it truly, unobjectively, a 10/10 game? I don't know. But in my heart, it is. This is a phenomenal work of art and of love. I will treasure it and I encourage everyone, even if you are not familiar with chinese mythology, to try it. Just so that you can feel the passion that fueled every artist that made this game."
Positive,el juego es muy entretenido y las graficas se ven excelente

Positive,"An amazing game, and finally the long needed answer to the question ""Where do I start if I want to get into souls-likes*""*Yes I know it's not ~technically~ a souls like, but you all know what I mean.Anyways, GOTY, 9.5/10."
Positive,"So, you’re a monkey. With a stick. And somehow, that’s enough to take down massive mythical beasts and gods. Sure, makes sense.The graphics? Yeah, they’re good. Probably the best thing since weather apps replaced looking out the window. The combat? Button-mash until something falls over, or you do. Either way, it’s an experience.I died 47 times to a frog. The frog wasn’t even a boss. It’s just a frog. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys suffering disguised as fun.7/10 Bananas"
Positive,"My first entry to a ""souls-like"" game and I can easily say it's been incredible so far!-Gameplay/Story:The game is relatively linear yet challenging, putting you up against difficult bosses, sometimes spending hours trying to beat them.It does offer some side quests or secret quests, but none of them are tedious or require you to grind.The Game is visually stunning. Each chapter offers a different atmosphere/climate to play in, with creatures fitting those atmospheres/climate.-Performance:Having to tweak some of the graphics' settings, the game runs well on around the 60fps mark on my RTX 2080 Super paired with a 6700K.I barely faced any bugs or crashes. The game just works out of the box."
Positive,Game is quality man it truly is art. It is so pretty to look at and on my PC I have had little issues with performance.I7-117004070 super32 gb ramYou can really tell the devs care about the material used and its a fun story with cool settings. Somehow the combat feels fun and you can change things up even though it boils down to two different buttons. The biggest issue with this game is the lack of a map. What a wild overlook the levels are confusing at some point where I feel like i'm missing things I shouldn't be simply because i have no way to really check. Adding a map would be divine. 8/10 It isn't ground breaking but it is very good.
Positive,I would say that everyone should give this masterpiece try. Truly GOTY!!!!!

Positive,"Got the game with a 4080 Super purchase, and my first ever pc build from gaming laptops just for this game. I gotta say, it was worth every penny spent. It scores beyond GOTY in my heart as a Chinese boy who grew up reading and watching the fantasy of the Great Sage! Now that I am 26, the last moments of this game still hit me with so much emotion. I cannot express how proud I am witnessing the fruition of this game. It was like Ke Huy Quan winning the Oscar. 81 hours, 81 achievements. I wish I could be objective and get into this game with unbiased eyes, but in the meantime, I also wish the opposite. Objectively, this game has many flaws, lack of optimisation, lack of explorable open areas, etc., but with my cultural background, my final review of this game can only be concluded as a Chinese idiom, ""瑕不掩瑜""！"
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong is one of the games that delivers and lived up to the hype, from the compelling story of the events taking place after the famous Journey to the West, with its outrageous and unique enemy variety and design and amazing boss fights, I definitely had a freaking blast playing through this gem of a game and achieved 100% completion for the game. I really love the skill trees and the amount of skills you have in the game, with a bonus point of being able to re-spec to different playstyles and combining with different staff stances. Another thing I want to highlight is that the game isn't difficult at all, for me I found it pretty easy until towards the final bosses for the last 2 chapters which was a more challenging experience (also the fact that I have played many souls-like games), but BMW is an action rpg, not a soulslike. For someone who doesn't know about Journey to the West, I am now invested in this story after playing through this game. The developers have done an excellent job telling the story and my only feedback is that they should focus more on deciding where to put their invisible walls so it doesnt trick the players that we can explore more what we can see but it turns out its been blocked. Their level design also needs some improvement which I feel they can take some inspiration from FROMSOFTWARE games or Cyberpunk 2077 if they want to achieve verticality in their designs. Visually, Unreal Engine 5 is gorgeous and paired with the fantastic combat system, I didn't encounter any crashes, only some frame drops despite playing on ultra settings with raytracing, dlss and frame generation turned on. I'm eagerly waiting for the DLC which they can take the time to improve on their level design. Overall, 9/10 for me."
Positive,"As a Taoist/Buddhist Chinese, Journey to the West (2011) was my jam when I was a kid. I remember that there was one channel airing this show, and every time I tuned in to watch it, I was amazed by all the cool stuff in the show. The choreography of Sun Wukong fighting yaoguais and gods in aerial combat, the crazy CGI effects, the world-building and beautiful scenery, the soothing opening of the Heart Sutra, and the legendary ending song, ""Where is the Road?"" All of these wowed me as a kid, and then this game decided to bring that same experience to the rest of the world.Game Science went all out with the trailers for this game. Every time they showed the game, whether it was gameplay videos or story trailers, they just kept getting better. They've shown so much, yet so little. This inflated the game's original scope to gargantuan proportions, along with the expectations. Even now, I still get chills every time I watch these trailers, and I've watched them a lot before the game's release. I was initially afraid that the game would be overpromising, mainly because it looked too good, almost unreal. And spoiler alert: this game did not disappoint and even exceeded my expectations. I completed the game in 60+ hours, which is pretty short, but it didn't feel short at all. It felt like a fulfilling journey from start to finish.First off, this is visually the best-looking game I've ever played. The lighting, the shaders, the atmosphere, the environment, the world-building, the unnecessarily detailed sculptures and elements of both Taoism and Buddhism, the snow, the sand, and the clouds are all as realistic and cinematic as you can get. The levels in the game are actually much bigger than you'd expect, given its linear nature. The game has a lot of very missable secrets too. Some of these secrets include hidden bosses, hidden dialogues and encounters, and even whole new areas. Without Googling them, I am sure that I would've missed a large chunk of what the game has to offer. There are many branching paths, and the game feels deceptively open. Because of this, you will inevitably encounter the dreaded invisible walls, which can break immersion.The combat is rather simple but has some depth. You have three stances to choose from on the fly, with spells that can paralyze enemies, buff yourself, turn rock solid to parry incoming attacks, or dash away and become invisible to get out of harm's way. You can also transform into the enemies you've slain for an immediate attack, and the transformation lasts for a short while. These transformation spells even have their own unique movesets. However, the core combat loop feels mostly the same throughout the game. You use light attacks to fill up your focus and unleash heavy attacks based on how many focus points you want to use. Which brings me to the next point, and why the combat, despite being simple and a bit repetitive, wasn't an issue for me.The biggest highlight of this game is the variety of bosses you will encounter. This game has so much enemy and boss variety, it's actually mind-boggling. There are literally more than 100 bosses, which is insane considering how they managed to pull it off. And these bosses are all unique, with very minimal reskins or copy-pasted enemies. Even when some bosses are reskins, they have very unique and different movesets, which makes fighting a familiar-looking foe feel like a fresh new experience. Because of this staggering amount of unique bosses, I never got tired of the combat, as every boss has different threats and attack patterns, with different openings and weaknesses to exploit.I enjoyed the game's story. I can see why people say the story is pretty confusing and so on. However, if you have a modicum of knowledge of Journey to the West (JTTW), you will be fine with the story. The game's story and characters are strongly related to the original telling of JTTW. Those very familiar with JTTW will find the story meaningful and can even point out small secrets in the cutscenes. Every time you finish a chapter, a beautifully animated musical video will play. It felt so rewarding to watch these musical videos after finishing the chapter. They're all really good and are absolute cinema. The developers didn't have to go this hard. The music is fantastic, from banger mantras to atmospheric music, boss themes, cutscene soundtracks, and the legendary leitmotifs of ""Where is the Road?"" are all top-tier.All this praise aside, there are a few cons I have to point out. The biggest issue is the performance. During the first week of the game's release, I spent 30% of my playtime adjusting the settings. This is more of Unreal Engine 5's fault. Every time a new asset appears on the screen, you will notice frame drops and microstutters. This is inherently Unreal Engine 5's flaw, and it will eventually get better. Because of these inconsistent frames and stuttering early on, it led to unfair deaths against some bosses. But after the patch, and with some registry editing mods from Nexus, I was able to get 60 FPS consistently on very high with hacked DLSS support on my RTX 2060.I also noticed that the later chapters of the game, Chapters 5 and 6, felt short and rushed. In Chapter 5, the frequency of boss fights felt too high. In Chapter 6, you're thrown into a massive open yet empty area. The first four chapters are much more fleshed out and don't have this issue.This game is special. It gave me the same sense of awe I felt as a kid watching Journey to the West on TV, and it surprised me countless times as I played. Not a lot of games have done that for me. This game also sparked a newfound appreciation for my culture. Seeing gods and deities I've actually seen and prayed to in temples come to life in the story, and even fighting them, feels so cool. Recently, I've been reading and researching stories of the gods and deities that I pray to, which also appeared in the game, as well as the lore of Journey to the West. I can't believe I'm saying this, but this game made me feel proud as a Taoist/Buddhist. This is my personal Game of the Year, 10/10."

Positive,just plain amazing
Positive,"An absolute masterclass of an ARPG. Everything was painstakingly crafted from rich background material and moulded into something new and darker. The story of Journey to the West is known to most but this is a sequel. Animations, cutscenes, combat, visuals, story and character development... This game has it all. If you love a big, meaty action RPGs with rich lore and a great story then this game is for you, 100%.Small cons:1. Exploration is not exactly there because there are a lot of invisible walls in this game - far from open world. Still, it does not need to be open world if the world is that gorgeous.2. Some items are RNG based drops from enemies and harvesting plants. In a diablo style loot-driven ARPG this can work but not in a Soulslike or third person ARPG and might rub achievement hunters the wrong way.Overall a beautiful experience. 10/10 would recommend."

Positive,Game quality speaks for itself.
Positive,Amazing game nothing to say bad about that
Positive,"Thank god sweet baby inc, and DEI didn't get their hands on this."
Positive,A nice middle ground between a souls like and an action adventure rpg. Arcade vibes with difficulties that keep you coming back. enemies between bosses a little lacking in diversity but good overall
Positive,China number one
Positive,Literally one boss ruined this game for me. Im still playing it and overall enjoy the game but white clad noble is the stupidest boss in entire game. Why give one boss a random spike in difficulty the most uncanny strike patterns AND give him a whole second health bar??? And to top it all off hes a boss in the beginning of the game. That was by far one of the stupidest decisions ive ever scene
Positive,"Game of the Year It's been awhile since I played a game that had me hooked to the point I couldn't stop playing. The combat is fluid, the environment is beautiful, the levelling up system is fun to explore, and unlocking new gear not only makes you look badass but also helps you along your journey. Why is combat so fun? Well, you get to capture the souls of monsters that you have defeated and use their skills; you can also transform into bosses you have defeated, and you get to pick which fighting stance to suit your playstyle. All stances can be changed on the fly during combat too. And you get a magic spell on top. Anyone telling you the combat is boring doesn't know what they are talking about.Is this a Soul's-like game? No, but it does have soul-like elements, such as Flask/Gourd, Bonfire/Shrines, and enemies respawn with huge boss battles. If you ever feel put off if this game is too difficult, worry not; I'd say this game is challenging at best and do-able once you practice perfect dodge.  Why is this my game of the year? For a start, the music in this game is amazing, from the combat to the story telling and how it hits on the right keynotes for that crescendo moment. Watching the end of the Chapter 5 cutscene and listening to the song, it really fits perfectly when the cord and vocals play out in each scene. Not only was the music amazing, but the art direction, too. Having different styles of art for every cutscene was a fantastic choice. It draws so much attention. I do like how the end of chapter 2 cutscene foreshadows a side mission in the game... Well done, Game Science. That was my favourite side mission. You would think fighting bosses after bosses would get tiresome, but Black Myth manages to make a game where each boss fight feels fascinating and fun. So many times when I play a game, it's just a reskin boss battle with the same attack from a previous level, but not the Black Myth. Each boss fight has their own unique attacks, and it just feels so fresh to see in a video game. Not only is the boss battle exciting, but all the monster designs look interesting too. I had fun reading up about them in your monster encyclopaedia book. This better win an award for music and art direction.  The ControversyFollowing Black Myth Wukong from the beginning, it has been so frustrating to see how unfairly treated this game has gotten from journalists, gaming journalists, and even a few content creators, for that matter. For those who are smart enough to know the whole controversy and how obvious it has become once you piece the dots together. DEI asks for money; said company makes DEI friends slander Game Science *Cough IGN*, every news outlet spread it like wildfire, gaming media reviewers purposely give games a low score, and on top of that, it clearly shows they never played beyond chapter 2.  To have DEI in Black Myth Wukong would truly break the art in this game. Not only art but the Asian culture and the essence that is rich in its history. It’s ""wrong"" to include DEI principles in a game based on Journey to the West (a classic Chinese novel); there is cultural authenticity that has historical context that is deeply rooted in Chinese culture and mythology.You also have to respect the artistic vision. Game Science wanted their game to be told. It's their story, their culture, and no outside influence has the right to tell them what to do. It's a game that started from passion.  It's also been frustrating to see some content creators turning a blind eye to Black Myth, to either no mention, no coverage, downplaying the game, or no mention how it has broken records and sold X amount of copies and made X amount of millions. Shamefully, even Easy Allies didn't even cover this game, and they were more hyped for Concord, lol.  This game is more than just Game of the Year. It has been through a lot, and yet, despite it all, I'm sad to say, it will get snubbed at the Gaming Awards, and if it does, then you and I know, it was rigged.  I can't wait for the DLC; it will smash more records to come. Hail To The Monkeyking"
Positive,Great game a mix of god of war and dark souls.
Positive,"After completing Chapter 2, defeating all the bosses, and uncovering every secret, I can confidently place this game alongside Elden Ring. Every aspect is flawlessly executed, from the design and artistic direction to the narrative and gameplay mechanics, including character progression. This game has completely blown me away. It's pure enjoyment and non-stop adrenaline. I sincerely thank the developer for this incredible work, and from the bottom of my heart, I hope it wins Game of the Year. Would I recommend it? Absolutely, brothers!"
Positive,"As a gamer in his mid-50's I sometimes worry about a game being too twitch-reflex focused or too weighted towards younger folks who have more free time to get good than I do. Wukong is this amazing blend of challenge, strategy and an iterative build system where you can continue to work around a level gaining experience and spirit points and improve some aspect of your character that will be just enough to get past a pesky boss.The combination of really interesting skills, spells and abilities, along with the effects of spirits and inventory items allows for a seemingly endless set of possibilities for your character's development. Story scenes are really well done and don't go on and on, but give just enough to incite interest in the storyline.The soundtrack is really excellent too and my wife who grew up in Vietnam came into my game room and said how it reminded her of when she was very young and watching ""Journey to the West"" with her family. All in all, I would have to say the game developers captured something which seems rare these days--a beautiful game with fun as the #1 priority. I love it and am finding it very addictive, even when I'm having a hard time against a boss. Highly recommend this one!"
Positive,"Game has fun and engaging combat, good story and character development. Environments are very well designed (outside of invisible walls which mark ends of the map / OB areas).Definitely not a souls like, game was much easier than any souls like I've played but was still challenging. Certain bosses definitely make you struggle if you don't use the correct strategies against them, but once employed they are quite do-able.If you like searching for all the loot in the map, you will likely find all the items to make you strong enough to beat bosses on the 1st try.Most bosses died on the 1st try, a few took 2 tries. Only 1 boss killed me 4 times (Yellow Loong). Like i said, not a souls like. Maybe a bit harder than GOW 2018.9/10 was fun."
Positive,"Игра определенно хороша.  Если кортоко: Бодрый соулслайк без наказания за смерти и огромным бестиарием боссов.Дадее поподробнее:Из позитивного: Красивые локации со множеством различных биомов. Интересные и разнообразные боссы. Игра не дает заскучать и буквально каждые 15-20 минут вас ждет схватка с уникальным врагом.Боевка интересная и завязана на комбинировании атак и магии, которая открывается при прогрессии.Дерево прокачки очень обширное и представляет множество возможностей для выбора собственного стиля прохождения. Судя по всему прокачать все способности при первом прохождении не получится, так что готовтесь проходить NG+ для сборки мега-бибизяна.Но хотелось бы сказать и о минусах:При прохождении часто будут встречаться летающие противники и поскольку основным нашим оружием является посох, то возникают некоторые неудобства при нанесении урона. Часто можно просто не попадать в хитбокс врага.Самый большой минус на мой взгляд - это странное решение геймдизайнеров относительно локаций. Они красивые, но зачастую возникают сложности из за невидимых стен: Кажется что тут можно пропрыгать или спуститься вниз, но персонаж упирается в невидимую стену. Меня данная проблема раздражала на протяжении всей игры. Причем в более поздних главах существуют таки места где можно реально свалиться и помереть, хотя по началу разработчики уберегают нас от прыжков в пропасти. С точки зрения сюжета: мне как человеку незнакомому с оригиналом (Путешевствие на Запад) было сложно разобраться во взаимоотношениях персонажей, которых мы встречаем по пути. Но зато появилось желание ознакомиться с оригиналом. Вердикт: Несмотря на вышеупомянутые минусы игра определенно заслуживает внимания, если любишь данный жанр, то смело рекомендую попробовать. Ну а я пойду попробую пройти NG+"

The game is full of detail exploring the mythos of Journey to the West, with subtle references to Buddhism and Taosim, although this maybe hard of you haven't studied these topics.

Difficulty wise easy to learn hard to master. One of the most worth games i have bought in recent years."
Positive,"Review of ""Black Myth: Wukong""By a Soul Gamer and ARPG EnthusiastPros:""Black Myth: Wukong"" stands out as an incredibly immersive experience with a captivating story that draws players in from the start. The game’s art direction is top-tier, both visually and musically. The graphical fidelity is stunning, with a level of detail that makes each scene feel like a meticulously crafted piece of art. The musical score complements the action perfectly, enhancing the overall emotional tone of the game. Watching the cutscenes often feels more like watching a high-quality animated film than a typical in-game cinematic, a testament to the developers' artistic vision.The variety of playstyles is another standout feature. The combat system offers a rewarding depth once you master it, with beautiful and satisfying combos. For an ARPG, this fluidity in combat, especially when chaining moves together, feels incredibly rewarding. The dodging mechanism deserves a special mention—it’s finely tuned to encourage player interaction with the game’s bosses. Unlike many other ""Souls-like"" games, where stamina management can feel like a punishment, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" offers a more forgiving approach for newcomers. Stamina drains less severely, and while there are consequences for running out, they’re not as punishing as in more traditional games of this genre. This design choice invites new players to experiment and engage more dynamically with combat without the constant fear of harsh penalties.Cons:However, as much as the game excels in several areas, it does have some noticeable drawbacks. The map design, for example, leaves much to be desired. It’s clear that Game Science initially envisioned an open-world structure, but likely due to pressure from investors, they had to scale back those ambitions. Unfortunately, this has led to a more restricted environment with the presence of invisible air walls, which can break immersion for a game that otherwise encourages exploration and discovery. The lack of distinctive landmarks further adds to the confusion. Many players will find themselves getting lost or disoriented, unsure of where they’ve been or where they’re supposed to go next, which can detract from the overall experience.The gear progression system is another area where the game feels a bit underwhelming. It’s fairly predictable and linear, with little variety or innovation to keep players engaged in that aspect. It’s not necessarily bad, but compared to the other layers of depth the game offers, it feels somewhat bland.There’s also a noticeable lack of continuity between chapters, which can make the story feel disjointed at times. While each section of the game is strong on its own, the transitions between them are not as seamless as they could be, making the narrative feel slightly fragmented.Final Thoughts:Despite its shortcomings, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is an impressive first outing from Game Science, especially for a debut project of this scale. With a bit more refinement in the map design, a more interesting gear progression system, and smoother transitions between chapters, the game has the potential to be a genre-defining experience.I caught some of the canned content on YouTube, and it’s clear that there was even more planned for the game that didn’t make it into the final cut. I genuinely hope that Game Science revisits this content in future DLCs and takes the time to polish these aspects further. It would be a fantastic way to fully realize the game’s original vision.Score: 8.5/10 (with potential to reach 9/10)All in all, a remarkable achievement for a first-time release. I’m excited to see what the future holds for this game and for Game Science as a studio."

Every strike, block, and dodge feels responsive and fluid. The combat is varied, with each boss introducing unique techniques and tactics, ensuring the gameplay never becomes repetitive. Each fight demands a different strategy, keeping you constantly engaged and on your toes, especially against the imposing bosses who boast creative and deadly abilities. These encounters feel epic and challenging, yet rewarding when mastered.Exploration is another highlight, with hidden treasures and powerful artifacts tucked away in every corner of the world. These secret finds aren’t just filler, but meaningful upgrades or lore-rich items that make exploration genuinely rewarding.Visually, the game is nothing short of a masterpiece. The stunning graphics bring every mythical creature and environment to life, which makes every frame feel like a work of art."
Positive,"This is the most fun game I've ever played, bar none. The varied battle system and rich storyline made me simply unable to stop. I think there is no better design than the fact that after failing, the things I gained before are still there. This will allow me to still get up after a boss failure and keep challenging, knowing that I trigger a new storyline.I've also played GTA5 before and that was a different feeling, all in all, I think WuKong is really good game!这是我玩过的最好玩的游戏，没有之一。多样的战斗系统和丰富的剧情，让我根本停不下来。我觉得最优秀的设计莫过于失败之后，我之前获得的东西依旧还在。这样会让我在BOSS失败后依旧可以站起来，不断的挑战，知道我触发新的剧情。我之前也玩过GTA5，那是另外一种感受，总之，我觉得悟空是真的不错的游戏！"
Positive,"I have been following Black Myth Wukong since its first footage reveal during development... I watched summaries and adaptations of Journey to The West and this game by far is the most artistic, and beautiful tributes to the Mythology. Story: A little confusing unless you have knowledge on Wukong's lore, but the animations inbetween chapter clears were wonderful, the True Ending was really neat but it requires alot of things to be done such as beating all secret bosses and doing certain quests.Gameplay: It's not bad, there's alot of cool moves you can do but the boss quality is variable, sometimes there are annoying bosses, sometimes there are fun and challenging ones. Looking up guides is helpful to understand where to go or what to build. Versatile upgrade systems.Graphics: I need not say anything else, Unreal Engine 5 displayed wonderfully, vibrant and realistic graphics I couldn't be happier with the performance on my 3080.Music: Top notch, very heartfelt in certain moments.Overall 8.5/10I would give it a better score if the boss quality was consistent."
Positive,Worth every second working my ass off top pay for this game. 10/10 for me
Positive,Best game of the year!
Positive,"First time playing a game like this, plot is unreal. Awesome characters and amazing ending. Difficult and aggravating but I enjoyed it through and through."
Positive,"So far, so good"
Positive,"be monke, stay monke, forever monke"
Positive,awesome game. can be grueling at times.
Positive,monke beat boss mans
Positive,What a fantastic game! Highly recommend to any type of gamer to play this. Would be awesome if they made a Hercules game just like this.
Positive,"Game of the year. The constant challenging but not extremly hard boss fights core gameplay just makes the game so exiciting and makes progress so rewarding and fun as hell. GOTY.  Only problem is like Elden Ring, it's not exaclty telling you where to go at times and it can get confusing. Just explore as much as you can and you'll be fine. For secret items and bosses explore around the map or look online."
Positive,"Excellent RPG with enough content to marvel anyone with power hype and the desire to defeat anything. My only complaint is that the game does revolve around EVERYTHING being accessed from bosses. After a while, bosses get tiring."
Positive,"The game looks very good, I'd give it a 10/10, but the game looks a bit too sharp for my liking. I'm not sure if it is because of DLSS or if it is how the game is supposed to look.Nothing bad to say about the music, it was pretty good.Can't say much about the story, since I lack context for it I'll skip that part of the review.Took me around 60 hours to get all achievements, with the main game taking me not much less than that. I think this is quite good for a linear game, though the time it takes to fully complete the game might vary because of RNG involved.Replayability is basically only NG+. It is nice that there is one but besides getting all achievements and/or stomping on enemies for the fun of it, I don't think there are many reasons to start NG+. The enemies do get stronger but not stronger to the point that the difficulty remains the same or harder compared to NG. With the amount of tools you have at your disposal, it's very easy to destroy almost any boss in the entire game.Certainly the best part of the game. You start with few options to deal damage, but as you progress you unlock more and more spells, tools, etc. that you can use to make the game more staisfying and fun, and all of those are quite varied. Whether you prefer an approach based on using your transformation to try and swiftly deal damage while remaining safe, relying purely on your melee attacks, or using your favorite mix of spells, you are free to use your arsenal as you please. You can also upgrade your gear, which is always a good feature to give a feeling of progression.Now, when it comes to bosses, I personally feel like it's a mixed bag: some were really fun, some were really frustrating. There are many bosses that are quite easy (at least, if you use everything at your disposal), and it's always a bit hard to evaluate a boss when it is an easy one because they die very easily. There are other that feel significantly harder than others and took me quite a few attempts, sometimes because they take time to learn, sometimes because it is hard to see what move they are about to do before they actually perform it, etc.. One thing that is (too) common for a lot of bosses is grabs and waves of attacks you can't punish. I think there's and abundance of them and it gets really annoying after some time (especially the grabs, to this day there are some that I don't know how to evade or if you can even evade them). There are also bosses that have what I'd call artificial difficulty, which is to say something that will nerf you and you can't do anything about it, be it nullifying part of your build, nerfing your stats directly, having (seemingly) undodgeable grabs, and so on. That and the grabs/waves of unpunishable attacks led to quite a few bosses feeling cheap. Some bosses also have very weird lock-on and leads to the player missing hits because of the auto-targetting, which get frustrating quickly. Despite that, I think most bosses were still enjoyable.Not looking at NG+ here, only NG. I used every tool that was available, and I think that makes almost every boss range between easy and medium (and somewhat difficult for a few) range. I might not have used the ""best"" weapon/spells/etc. as I don't know for sure what they are, but I think that almost everything (there are outliers) is balanced well enough to make it so that you can play however you want and not feel like you are using a significantly worse build or item than another one.I feel like the rewards you get for exploring the maps (which are quite linear anyway, so you aren't really going off the beaten track) are decent enough, many of the very interesting rewards are tied to side content which is a good thing in my opinion. No spoilers, but I will say that there are sometimes items that may or may not be important and feel like they are in very random locations that you won't encounter just by running around the map, so you either get them because you looked them up or you were lucky.The playable parts of the maps are mostly fine, it's quite easy to just run through the enemies from shrine to shrine if you feel like it and there isn't a lot of running around before encountering bosses. There is only one map that I really dislike, which is Pagoda, this place gets confusing really quickly because everything looks similar, it's easy to fall to your death, and there is the special effect that drains your max health to make sure that if you're careless while trying to run through/fight enemies, you will die very quickly There is also a slightly annoying effect on screen, only saved by the ability to see enemies more easily.However, there is a glaring issue with the map design, and it isn't about the playable part of the map. No matter the map, I always found myself running into what I thought was a path but was actually an invisible wall. I feel like many parts of basically every map in the game that are closed off by invisible walls were intended to be part of the playable map, but due to some constraints Game Science chose to close these parts of the maps without actually blocking the path visually, which led to me running into invisible walls pretty often. Definitely the weakest aspect of the game."
Positive,You like soul-lite games? Action packed? Good graphics? Fantastic Animations? So many boss fight? Not so difficult game? This is for you.
Positive,easy game invis walls bs hidden bosses bs
Positive,"Challenging with lots of secrets, worth playing."
Positive,Best game in 2024
Positive,"Good experience for the first Chinese culture heavy AAA game.+ Combat feels good most of the time other than some weird technical omission like enemy's projectiles ignoring obstacle to still land on me, or the questionable design choice that make us still goes into skill cooldown when the skill was interrupted (mainly freeze, which they obviously encourage timing it but still penalise us for missing it), or the minor transforming skill getting interrupted so easily and still uses our mana.+ Great Art/music design and character modeling, with no traces of the questionable character uglification that are oddly common in the modern Western gaming developers' creation.- Exploration is not the worst but is definitely painful. Having no map is really a questionable design, like they took inspiration from Elden Ring to encourage exploration without hand-holding, while at the same time decided to put quintilion amount of invisible wall that discourages exploration since the beginning, that conflict each other.- Story is kinda disappointing for me personally,  I went into the game expecting to be the cheeky/fun/arrogant Sun Wukong, only to be hit by a silent protagonist, rid of all charms that most Asians like to see from their childhood memory , which is again, a weird implementation of souls-like element that does not harmonise well with the game. However, some chapters do have amazing story telling.Overall, I am still glad for its success which may possibly brings some more fresh cultural theme AAA games, that has yet to be mature in the game industry worldwide (Asian/Chinese myth/literature theme). A huge step towards game diversity."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is arguably one of the best games I have played this year. The games is gorgeous; its combat is addictive and fluid; presents a decent challenge, especially to those that are new to souls-like games and other games of similar nature. However, the game sometimes feels like its leaving you in the dark.As Black Myth: Wukong is based of the classic Chinese novel A Journey to the West, i expected a bit more of a comprehensive story. There are many story beats that are often left unexplained and leave the player in the dark wanting to know more. While this is not always a bad thing, I personally felt that some of the more important story beats felt underwhelming due to just being unexplained. Despite all of this, it is fairly simple to put the pieces together (quite literally) and understand what your purpose is as The Destined One. Each chapter culminates in an animation that is not only amazing but the key you in on some of the characters ambitions and trials of tribulation. Most certainly a bright spot when it comes to storytelling. But again, the story left me wanting to know more about the characters and who they are. But, I suppose I should just invest on the original novel to know more.As mentioned, the combat in Black Myth: Wukong is incredible, It is engaging and easy to understand. This is in part thanks to the handy array of transformations and spells you can earn throughout the game. It truly is amazing that most of the bosses are unique and manage to find a way to separate themselves from others. While I did not find myself stuck on most of the bosses, they should present themselves as a decent challenge to those new to the journey. I personally wish that some of the more story related bosses where more difficult. The game also has some of the best fight sequences I have ever seen, especially a certain sequence related to the true ending. The biggest part of the combat is to understand what your weapons and skills do and its correlation with the armor you are wearing, especially late game.  The better you understand them, the easier your fights will be. Its also important to mention that your character and skills can be leveled up throughout the game. With that being said, its important to acknowledge what skills you need and what skills you don't. This is something you can only really figure out through playing with the variety of different skills though.Overall, I truly enjoyed Black Myth: Wukong and I hope that the rumors that the devs are planning a trilogy are true. I most certainly plan on going back for a NG+ run to collect the handful of achievements I had missed. People coming to play this game in wake of Elden Rings DLC will most certainly find themselves having a good time. New players should also find themselves enjoying the game. My biggest recommendation is for people to take their time and take in the world. There are handful of bosses and quests that are missable if you are not careful enough. The game should take most people, if you are thorough, anywhere between 30-40hrs to complete. It is also important to mention that is game is a bit more like a boss rush than it is a traditional souls-like.Score: 8/10 (Great)"
Positive,"There's reason this game is rated overwhelmingly positive. Go and play it NOW!Definitely one of the best games of 2024 with breathtaking visuals and addictive game-play. I reviewed the game after the 100% (which took around 50 hours) and was very pleased with what I got. I've tried all sorts of builds since re-spec-ing is free and easy to do. Not much flaws in the game with the exception of invisible walls and RNG drops for certain items for when you're trying to 100% complete it.Game is best played in chinese dub, good to hear the actual voice of sun wukong after so long in the prologue :)."
Positive,"WOWI was really hesitant to try this game, but I am so f**king glad I did. It can be fun using skills but it does get a little too button mashy. I didn't use any cores for stamina. I didn't really ever have an issue with stamina. The combat is probably the weakest part of the game. With that aside– the storytelling, the landscapes and world design, armor and weapon designs, the different types of animations between chapters OH MY GOD THE CHAPTER ANIMATIONS WERE BREATHTAKING AND SOMETIMES TEAR JERKING, The OST, there is so much greatness here that can wash aside the mediocre combat. I focused mainly on completing ALL journal entries so I didn't miss a single enemy, basic, elite, or boss.  It's a great blend of a God of War meets Dark Souls. 2 bosses were very difficult, like really really hard and required double digit attempts and a couple ALT F4s. There are multiple paths all throughout the game and some are surprisingly well hidden, they will hold a boss or two and/or a unique (Mythical) item. No map or compass, just follow your nose navigation which is the best style. I don't want an arrow or quest log telling me to go somewhere, I want to smell it out and discover it myself. Certain enemy types will have rare drops too that can encourage farming for specific gear. Can be considered tedious, but worth it if you're looking for certain items. I'm confident this will be GOTY. It's as close to a masterpiece that we’ve seen since Elden Ring. No MTX, no AAAA pricing, no half baked multiplayer in tow, just a fantastic single player adventure with great storytelling in jaw dropping scenery. ---{ Graphics }---☐ You forget what reality is☑ Beautiful☐ Good☐ Decent☐ Bad☐ Don‘t look too long at it☐ MS-DOS---{ Gameplay }---☐ Very good☑ Good☐ It's just gameplay☐ Mehh☐ Watch paint dry instead☐ Just don't---{ Audio }---☐ Eargasm☑ Very good☐ Good☐ Not too bad☐ Bad☐ I'm now deaf---{ Audience }---☐ Kids☑ Teens☑ Adults☐ Grandma---{ PC Requirements }---☐ Check if you can run paint☐ Potato☐ Decent☑ Fast☐ Rich boi☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer---{ Game Size }---☐ Floppy Disk☐ Old Fashioned☐ Workable☑ Big☐ Will eat 10% of your 1TB hard drive☐ You will want an entire hard drive to hold it☐ You will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data---{ Difficulty }---☐ Just press 'W'☐ Easy☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master☐ Significant brain usage☐ Difficult☐ Dark Souls---{ Grind }---☐ Nothing to grind☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks☐ Isn't necessary to progress☑ Average grind level☐ Too much grind☐ You'll need a second life for grinding---{ Story }---☐ No Story☐ Some lore☐ Average☐ Good☑ Lovely☐ It'll replace your life---{ Game Time }---☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee☐ Short☐ Average☑ Long☐ To infinity and beyond---{ Price }---☐ It's free!☑ Worth the price☐ If it's on sale☐ If u have some spare money left☐ Not recommended☐ You could also just burn your money---{ Bugs }---☑ Never heard of☐ Minor bugs☐ Can get annoying☐ ARK: Survival Evolved☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs---{ ? / 10 }---☐ 1☐ 2☐ 3☐ 4☐ 5☐ 6☐ 7☐ 8☑ 9☐ 10"
Positive,The faithful adaptation of Journey to the West that adds its own interpretation of the story and creates a game of masterpiece.+stunning and beautiful storytelling that can evokes your emotion+fun and fluid combat system with a variety of magical spells+massive amount of enemies and bosses in the game with some of it having unique gimmick+tons of secret and easter eggs that hides in the game that make exploration rewarding-Poor map navigation design and invisible walls that ruin the exploration experience-repetitive combat style that didn't change much until the end of the game
Positive,8.5/10 - Playing normally7/10 - Playing for 100%. Too many missables and also require a guide for some hidden items/quests
Positive,I loved the game THATS ALL!!
Positive,"It's sooo good, just like everyone says... at least all those who like video games, must buy"
Positive,"Good for one playthrough. The combat system is pretty shallow considering you're stuck with one moveset through the whole game, once you hit the halfway mark it kinda falls off. The spells canonical or not left me wanting. Pluck kinda ruins the flow and feels like a cheese, same with immobilize. Transformations were also uninteresting to me. There are build variants out there but I just want to hit boss with stick and dodge good so all of that stuff just felt cheesy. Damage is heavily dependent on the combo system. There's a couple issues with this, as the system uses resources (focus) to stack damage which is a critical point of boss fights, the target tracking is exceptionally weak - sometimes you'll have a 4pt focus loaded up and completely miss the attack despite being pressed right up against the boss collider. This becomes super frustrating and immediately destroys the sense of pace. You also don't get hyperarmor for anything so any mob can interrupt. With that said I think this is probably due to what I believe are extremely accurate hurtboxes and hitboxes, which is kinda cool. And then the light attack spam - there's not a lot of variation and it doesn't feel great, they definitely needed a longer chain or staffs with longer chains or something. Maybe contextuals (sprint/dodge) Even the moveset variation staff is the same with attack altered from a small spinning multi-hit AOE to single-target multi-hit. Combat can flow, but it's seldom sustainable.Considering this is a combat oriented game this is a pretty considerable error.There are invisible walls everywhere. It makes sense, it allowed them to avoid scope creep and turn this into a generic empty open world. When they couldn't silo off players with shear cliffsides or castle walls they inserted invisible walls. This leaves us with natural looking forest areas and without the Ubisoft dreck. Mostly, in theory that is: there are a lot of them that are just nonsensical and apparently placed to cordon off anywhere that isn't the highly on-rails area. This becomes extremely obnoxious in some areas and there's nothing to signal to the player that these boundaries exist which worsens the experience of exploration of these environments, though this improves as one moves into later levels.The developer has elected to follow the fromsoft modal of NG+, limiting the materials for any given run and thus limiting the player's ability to experience everything the game has to offer behind NG+[++++]. As with the Souls series, upgrading things may require several playthroughs. Unlike Souls, there really isn't much variation here. Also unlike souls there are set items and stat packages unlocked in the highest upgrade package that are otherwise invisible, as well as massively different designs on the armors. I'm really disappointed I won't be able to experience this because farming for some of these materials would require boss rushing multiple NG+'s and, in my opinion, this game should be experienced in a single playthrough due to its shallows.Ostensibly you could rebuild but I'm of the opinion that the fundamental system - combat - is so compromised that fun, interesting, enjoyable experiences in NG+ will be few and far between. The interesting part is that there are several movesets and variations that are integrated but go unused. I hope in future they'll integrate these into the core game, it doesn't really make sense not to have them as variations on spell and movesets - think intro fight and the end.I think it's pretty plain to see that the graphics are good. But so are the animations. They managed to nail boss design more or less - given the damage output of the player character and the poor tracking the bosses are a little too tanky c'est la vie I guess. There's a huge number of bosses and a reasonable amount of variation between them with a minimal amount of asset recycling. The first playthrough of the game feels fresh, challenging, interesting and engaging, but with the weak combat system interest is propped up by the environments, storytelling, novel finds (curios, soaks, flasks, armor, drinks, etc...), and cinematic aspects and less by the game itself. Had I not been forced into NG+ to complete the achievement list I think a lot of these design failures would've been less evident, but they become extraordinarily plain-to-see once you've ran it enough. And I think I can recommend it based on that, but I also think it's overrated given the pretty considerable failures. It's a solid debut."
Positive,This game is a 9.5 easyyyyyy. Great game all round.
Positive,Game of the year.

Positive,不知道如何表达黑神话给我的这种感觉，好像又回到了小学周五期待回家登录4399的时光，一切都那么有激情，那么有希望。8.20黑猴刚上线的时候我还在备考IELTS，为了推剧情我甚至每晚挤出时间来赶游戏进度——虽然最后首考7.5（捂嘴笑诚然，黑神话不是完美的，无处不在的空气墙，略显奇葩的地图设计，以及最开始的各种bug，但瑕不掩瑜——细致入微的美工，精致的文化背景，宏大的中式建筑——我最喜欢看每章结束后的绣像和动画，喜欢研究影神图里一个个立体的人物形象。看到最后大圣撩起衣袍转身走出水帘洞的结局，我知道我也得转身回归现实生活，经历自己的81难了，但100个小时的游戏时间，81个成就全满，让我重走了一段西游后传，重新找回来丢失已久的电子勃起，再一次为了那只脍炙人口的猴子热泪盈眶。无论如何， 踏平坎坷成大道，斗罢艰险再出发 ，祝我，祝你，祝每一个人，祝国产3A，都能永葆大圣那份顽强不屈的意志和一往无前的勇气吧！
Positive,"It is a breathtaking triumph of storytelling and gameplay. Its stunning visuals, fluid combat, and rich world-building create an immersive experience that’s hard to put down. This game is a must-play for anyone who loves epic adventures and dynamic action."
Positive,"TL:DR rating -> Epic/10I rarely get the urge to platinum a game, but after what the devs gave us for the secret boss fight, it became a game worthy for the 100%.Detailed Review:-So Wukong chapter 1 starts off with a fairly linear map and straight forward fun bosses and you get the impression that its 7.5/10 or 8/10 game.Then chapter 2 starts and it opens up. And then chapter 3 is just massive and the ante just keeps picking up from there till the end.As someone who has played the souls games a lot, I didn't face any issues with any of the bosses in terms of difficulty(Only 2 secret/optional bosses are a good challenge). Wukong's focus is mainly on level design, storybuilding/lore, enemy design and variety. And it exceeds expectations in all these departments.Pros:-1.)Every chapter ends with an animated short clip. These clips are astonishingly well made and deserves special plaudits.2.)Enemy variety and Design - There's so many enemies and bosses in this game and none of them are really copy paste bosses(except the frogs but even they have different elemental effects).3.)Storytelling based on existing lore. This is spectacularly done. The quest design is also quite fun. If you are exploring well, its very hard to miss questlines.4.)Level Design - Chapter 1 and 5 are fairly straightforward and linear. Chapter 2,3 and 4 have massive sprawling interconnected multi-layered levels. Very fun to explore. Chapter 6 is basically a big circle with bosses spread around the map.5.)There are 2 secret optional bosses who are a good level of challenge. One of these fights is extremely special and is easily the most fun I have had in years. Jawdropping spectacle.Cons:-1.) To get platinum, NG+ run is a must as some weapons only unlock in NG+ and the components to craft 2 pieces of an armor are also only available in NG+.     But that is still fine since you can speedrun NG+ which takes a few hours. The most annoying thing is to obtain certain items you need to either get lucky, or farm a single enemy for hours.I had to waste nearly 3 hours killing the same enemies to get -> thunderflame seal curio and tiger tendon belt curio. I don't know what the drop rate is for these items but its terrible.This is a shame and a practice game companies should lean away from. It sucks the fun out of things having to mindlessly run a loop killing enemies hoping to get an item drop.2.) Some areas of the map look like they can be easily dropped down to and explored but there are some invisible walls. That is kind of immersion breaking.'3.) Technical issues for a lot of people with texture popins, lighting imbalance etc. I got lucky to not get any major technical issues. I did face some lighting glitches in 1 or 2 areas.4.) English voice acting is ass. Especially for sun wukong. Thankfully, your character ddoesn't speak at all during the game. The only part where wukong speaks is during the intro and the end of chapter    cutscenes. The chinese voice acting on the other hand, sounds exceptionally good but then again, that is to be expected.That's about all the major issues I had with the game tbh. Very fun game overall. And especially coming from a studio with their first major release, Game Science have done a spectacular job. Hopefully more to come from them with this same level of quality."
Positive,"A very, VERY amazing and beautiful game. There is a lot that you can miss out on if you don't take the time to search around every area in the chapters, side quests lead you to WHOLE other secret areas with bosses that are almost cooler then the actual chapter bosses. In terms of gameplay, you can play how you want with your own playstyle using the skill tree your given, and the amount of spirit summons you collect can lead to some very interesting combinations! I give the game a 9/10 respectively, reason being is there's one chapter in the game with so many BIG bosses and i'm fighting the camera/lock-on to the point where you just straight up whiff attacks at an invulnerable/invisible hitbox..Definitely recommend!"
Positive,"Very interesting story and I like the challenge from different bosses, it is difficult to win but still you would find the way to fight."
Positive,It was worth it.

Positive,"Some people are angry that this game has no gay characters, but in fact there is one: You, the player.No but seriously, just enjoy the game for what it is. Who cares if there is no ""whamen"" in the first few chapters? This game is awesome! It looks great, plays fantastic and most importantly it's fun thanks to the great combat system and interesting story.This is a game, that is supposed to entertain and it does it's job very well! It doesn't need inclusion, diversity or equality. It's just not that type of game.If You care about politics, look elsewhere."
Positive,"So far it's good. But I wish after we grind the game for 3 times. Defeat unfair boss, they should have reward the Wukong Stance in Permanent, not only for 1 minute. We payed and played hard to acquire it after all. Hoping for update soon."
Positive,"I got introduced to the Journey to the West story through a game called Enslaved, and then later in college when I read the book. I'm a huge fan of the Monkey King story, and I feel like this game is very good about sticking to the mythology. I really enjoy the game, and find it challenging, as well as entertaining. I think it's a great addition to the collection of anyone who enjoys challenging games!"
Positive,"Sincerely, Black Myth: Wukong is one of the best games I’ve ever completely played. The combat system is seamless, allowing for smooth transitions between dodging and engaging in battle. This creates a dynamic and engaging tempo, especially during boss fights, where dodging becomes a crucial and rewarding strategy. The game’s system of transformations, spells, and gear sets a high bar for future DLC releases. Additionally, the lore is exceptional and truly sets this game apart from others. Overall, it’s a fantastic achievement, and it’s the first game I’ve ever 100%ed on Steam."
Positive,its amazing the only thing that can make it better is adding the ability to rechallenge bosses

Positive,"I had such a good time with this. Some locations and boss hit boxes can be improved but that's my only gripe with it. Chinese mythological figures are so interesting and they translate into bosses and side characters very well (Bajie <3). Build diversity is good enough if you keep experimenting throughout the game. On the whole, this was a memorable journey."
Positive,"I enjoy furry Dark souls very much, Very fun, lots of replayability, plenty of playstyles to try. Want to just gang up and wreck bosses with shadow clones like naruto? you can do that. Want to sweat perfect dodge and parry whatever you want? there is a build for that? dont want to even play as the protag instead play as a boss you fought? there is a build for that."
Positive,"Spectacular!Con: Crashing/Freezing is a regular thing if the graphics are using to much memory. I'm not sure why, but I know some games show how much VRAM will be used based on your current settings (i.e. TLOU P1). This game just makes you guess. Even after using Nvidia Geforce's optimized settings, it's still unstable. My setup:AMD Ryzen 7 5800x 3.8 GHz Geforce RTX 3080 (MSI Trio) 10 GB VRAM G.

Positive,"Respectful criticism, yet still an absolute magnificent game that is worth your time.The overall presentation of the game is superb but the gameplay does have a few flaws that are worth mentioning. First and foremost, the level designs: They leave a lot to be desired. To me, it's as if the devs did not know whether they wanted a linear game or an open world game... and with that being said, that made some of the areas in certain chapters confusing on how to navigate and/or explore. Coupled with that, it made some boss fights appear out of nowhere with no preparation. While I never NEEDED it, a mini-map would be nice. Finally... invisible walls XDIf that's all I have to ""complain"" about, then I think that says something :D Boss fights were fantastic (some more ridiculous than others lol) but overall, if you truly learned the moves and used patience, it was rewarding when they fell.For those on the fence, do it. It is not a ""souls-like"" game and it will have you wanting to keep coming back for more. Nearly 80 hours in and I went through the game three times. It's just that good overall.9.5/10"
Positive,literally the first and the best 3a game in China
Positive,"Great game, 10/10 recommend playing. i hardly leave reviews on games but I like this one."
Positive,"I'm play this as a part of family share, good game btw. Don't look at my time play, I have playthrough for more than 80 hours. Every secrect I have found, 2 ending reached and almost own every items. The game just made me remember the old day, I always want to comeback home and watch Journey to the West (1986), the film great and so nostalgic. I recommended you should buy and play this game, if you can't afford it. Try to ask your friend or using family share to play the game together. Enjoy your journey, dear."

Positive,easily best game of the year
Positive,"I played the entire game on the Steam Deck. It ran 30 FPS consistently in almost all areas in the map. The game graphical settings were all set to low and FSR Frame generation OFF (this setting crashed the game after the intro battle but it was fixed in a recent patch, still I wouldn't recommend playing with this enabled). Every chapter ran good except chapter 3. The more you play the game the more the game lags (it's weird to explain but you'll know once you play it yourself). This ""accumulation"" of lag was the worst in chapter 3. My deck froze 2 times in chapter 3 alone (but not consequently, I returned to chapter 3 area a lot for other side missions). To fix the ""accumulative"" lag just restart the game. Overall the game is playable on deck and runs good."
Positive,Very good Game
Positive,"Honestly a great game, it has some absolute dog shit designed bosses but most of em are great."
Positive,10/10Changed my life.

Positive,"best ""Made in China"" product period!"
Positive,"TLDR; It is pure action packed fun through and through. If you like hitting things and seeing the ""you defeated so and so"" then this is it. I went into this with no expectations at all. To be honest I had no idea what the game was till I heard about the records it was breaking.Well, to say the least I was extremely impressed. Glued to the game INSTANTLY. A blast of a game to play through. Every second was just beating the mess out of bosses, and oh man it is satisfying. Now there are some parts of the game that can be difficult. But overall it is a fun time to just sit down and just kill things. That Erlang fight is just. WOW. Just wow. Best fight in the entire game hands down. Worth doing it if you have not. The second stage of the fight were you play as the stone monkey it is just an amazing cinematography of fighting, special moves, etc. It is just awesome.Update: I ended up getting 100% in trophies. It was a fun time for the most part. Having to farm for some of the items felt like they just added it to add a moderate amount of extra playtime for no reason. I don't have a problem with farming but after 4.5 hours to get one item is a joke imo. Other than that it was a fun time fighting all the extra bosses and side quests I missed."
Positive,"Pretty fun! The invisible walls bug me a bit, though."
Positive,ape together strong
Positive,"Review After 100% *Black Myth: Wukong* is nothing short of a masterpiece in the action RPG genre. From the moment you step into its world, you're captivated by the stunning visuals that bring ancient Chinese mythology to life in ways rarely seen in gaming. The combat is incredibly fluid and satisfying, demanding both strategy and skill, making every battle feel like an epic encounter.What truly sets this game apart is its deep narrative, inspired by the classic *Journey to the West*. The story is rich, immersive, and filled with layers of cultural significance that draw you in, making you feel like you're part of a grand, mythological tale. The world is vast and beautifully designed, from lush forests to towering mountains and mystical temples, each environment bursting with detail and atmosphere.While there may be some minor technical hiccups, they do little to detract from the overall experience. *Black Myth: Wukong* is a bold and innovative game that not only lives up to its hype but surpasses it. It’s a must-play for anyone who loves action RPGs or simply wants to experience a story-driven game with heart, soul, and a breathtaking sense of adventure"
Positive,"This game is just what we needed to follow up Elden Ring. It's a pleasantly surprising take on the souls-like genre with its own unique feel. It derives some aspects from God of War in its loot system, some areas of the map design, and partial hack-and-slash nature. With removing back-stabs and critical attacks, the game notably plays less like a souls-like, but not in a tragic or unappealing way. It offers its own taste of refreshing combat with jump attacks, transformations and spells. The game starts off with a strong, amazingly animated cutscene. However, the beginning of the first chapter is slow-building with easy bosses although this is deceitful. The difficulty is infinitely ramping entering the next chapter with the infamous Yellow Wing Sage. If you are not aware of his cruelty, then you soon will. 24 hours in, I'm not able to attest to the overall difficulty of the game but I've spent every single one of my hours exploring the game to the fullest and finding every isolated chest and every optional boss. This game is not Elden Ring, Dark Souls 3 or Bloodborne but that's okay because it doesn't try to be. If you're willing to enjoy this game for the unique offering that it is, then it can easily take its rightful place as the Souls game of the year that you have long been awaiting."
Positive,"Got to say this is one of the most visually stunning games iv played in a very long time, the souls like fights with the bosses makes my hair stand on end in excitement and the story is top tier, defiantly in my top 10 favourite game list of this year, i am looking forward to more games like this hopefully in the future!"
Positive,"WORTHY FOR THE TITLE OF ""GAME OF THE YEAR""BECAUSE YOU ARE PLAYING AS A MONKE"
Positive,i love monkey oo oo ah ah
Positive,"Best Game of the Year! #2024Great competitive game play, superb graphics, interesting story line, and exceptional gear system."
Positive,"Really well constructed game, nice osts, AMAZING GRAPHICS, IT DOESNT HAVE THE HELLISH POISON SWAMP MAP, a lot of bosses, the combat is a little limited (light attack is the same, with diff heavy attacks, but that doesnt mean its bad, it still pretty enjoyable, the See through skill is pretty hard to use, making u think, instead of just smashing buttons to attack, and its        very satisfying to hit, and the stone skin is perfect.) interesting plot, the only bad thing is the level design is some chapters  (ERLANG I HATE YOU STOP ABSORBING MY SPELLS AND PROCS)   overall 10/10 game!"
Positive,game of the year 1000000000000/10
Positive,I like being powerful monkey.
Positive,Game is good
Positive,boss rush combat game
Positive,Apes together strong!
Positive,"It's a good game.To all souls like fans, no ... it's not really a souls game. It has many familiar mechanics, but it's more like new God of War games. So don't get mad if it doesn't feel like souls games. Anyway worth buying!"
Positive,"Incredible game! It strikes an amazing balance of exploration, small enemy fights, and grand-scale boss showdowns. The combat is crisp, smooth, and rewarding. The game constantly rewards you with new abilities, moves, upgrades, and items; all of which feel satisfying, and serve distinct purposes within the levels. The storytelling and visual prowess of this masterpiece is top of top! Even the developers know that they made a beautiful game as there are spots for ""meditation"" to enjoy key points of interest within the levels.Overall, this game is stunning and so rewarding to play! The only downside in my opinion is there are many points within the level that have ""invisible walls"" blocking the player from moving past the boundary. This itself is not much of an issue, as the linear level design does open up a bit later, and allows players to stay on track and not get too caught up spending their time exploring under every rock and behind every bush (something I am very guilty of while gaming). However, there are also points in the levels where I thought, ""Oh! I probably can't go past this point."" or ""Hmm...I don't think I can jump up this.""; yet, I was able to explore beyond those points and discover 'secret' areas of interest within the level for fun new items.TLDR; This is an incredible, must-play game for RPG enjoyers, engaging boss-fight fanatics, or anyone just looking for a beautifully-polished masterpiece from this generation of games. The only downside, is the unclear boundaries of exploration within the levels that lead to me missing multiple new items, unlocks, and mini-bosses."
Positive,"this is a 10/10 masterpiece, i was truly blown away, again and again. i thought it would be a good game and was not expecting it to be THIS AMAZING. im still going through chapter 4 and im already looking forward to playing it again in NG+. holy crap what a work of art"

Positive,"i dont know what to say, but this is masterprice!!!"
Positive,"I bought this game straight out of curiosity expecting absolutely nothing from it, and in just a few hours in I got overwhelmed by it's beauty and cinematic gameplay. Black Myth Wukong is a mix between Sekiro and God of War, and like Sekiro, the game is not for everyone, it is a very difficult game, each boss has his unique moveset and challenges you to be better in a different approach to the fight. I personally have struggled with a few of them, and it made each win feel rewarding and deserved the effort. The art style and graphics left me completely stunned, the game is gorgeous, and each chapter has it's own environment, making the game look different every step of the way. The only problem with this game is the performance, it is not very good optimized, has a few minor bugs and  sometimes it crashes. But it is still worth playing it. If you're a fan of Sekiro, God of War and a good challenge you're gonna love this one. 9/10"
Positive,"apes together strong. it was a wonderful day when i started playing black mythtotally recommended for people who wants to join the souls like-ish world. easy and fun to play. variety of mechanics to be used through the game. pros : 1- playing as an ape 2- sometime you will forget what time it is.3- great graphics that shows the environment excellently 4- different combat style cons:1- at some places throughout the game, you will notice a frame drop. 2- the skill tree is not fully applicated to support the game style 3- excessive amount of bosses 4- lack of game map, and easily get lost in conclude, the game is totally worth, specially that the game comes from a first time developer in AAA gaming industry. worth the time and sweat. a strong GAME OF THE YEAR candidate"
Positive,Sekiro + God of war 4 = Monke
Positive,"Amazing graphics, Decent storyline and best gameplay. Still Unoptimised you;ll face performance issue, Glitches, Stuttres, and framedrops everytime.  Some times it gives best performance without any issues. I think devs should release a patch to fix it becuase i have 16GB ram and 6GB Vram rtx3060 so it it still causing issues."

Positive,"This game is action-packed, full of details, and aesthetically pleasing. Some bosses are fairly challenging, but the combat is very fun! I highly recommend this to those who are into boss fights and Journey to the West/Chinese mythology!Combat feels rewarding, perfect dodges are so satisfying to pull offEach boss fight is refreshing, some are tough but fairGreat sense of progression, no penalty for death other than travelling back from spawnAdvanced graphics, atmosphere, and physicsStunning art direction, cinematography, as well as animation! I love the traditional visuals, cool character designs and action choreographyA memorable and appealing soundtrack, I really appreciate the music videos after each chapterAn impressive amount of secrets to discover, exploration is encouragedThis game stays authentic to the lore, the devs are passionate and have obviously put a ton of effort into researchAs many people have pointed out, invisible walls in this game can get annoyingVery graphically demanding, a high-end PC is recommended to experience things such as animated leaves and branches on trees, higher global illumination to reduce flickering, etc.Several textures are low fidelity even when the texture quality is set to maxSome English translation is a bit questionable"
Positive,"Pros: forgiving yet challenging game and fun gameplay with a story that is based on a buddist pilgrim 1400 years agocons: invisible walls, a filesize fit for a king, game mechanics that was not explained very well due to language translation."
Positive,"Its like Sekiro but Chinese, so damn good."
Positive,Headless Banjo Player is the GOAT
Positive,Best Chinese game of all time
Positive,"I never write reviews, but I have just completed this and this game is my personal GOTY 2024.As someone who knew nothing of Chinese mythology, and this being an introduction, I can't believe media companies have not made more effort into bringing these stories to a wider audience.This incredible action RPG has some of the best visuals, fluid combat and deep, immersive story. The story being, a reinterpretation of the classic ""Journey to the West"".The challenging gameplay, the breathtaking attention to detail in environments, the humorous yet intriguing characters, alongside intense boss battles creates a game that is both Epic and Personal. For 2024 its a game that stands out for its creativity, technical achievement and respect to the source material - definitely deserving of Game of the Year"
Positive,A real game. I have spoken.
Positive,"SO FUN!! I was hesitant at first because a lot of the reviews were saying it's just boss-rush (It is for the MOST part) but each of them are almost completely unique from the other which does make for a fun challenge. The combat is amazing, the story is also very good as well. A little hard to follow but look up a simple youtube video and bam! Very easy to understand. Would 100% recommend to anyone who thinks they are interested in it."
Positive,Amazing scenery and Great combat also from time to time i got the feeling that some bosses (mostly erling shen and great sages broken shell) adapted to an extent to my style of playing and thats really great in my opinion
Positive,monke with stick
Positive,"Awesome game, really addictive"
Positive,"JUST PLAY IT, MONKEYS!!!"
Positive,this game drove me insane and was considering suicide. 10/10 experience would play it again
Positive,"This game is just truly amazing! The graphics are beautiful, and the game looks great from the start. Each chapter feels unique and different from the others. The combat is fast, fluid and fun. Side characters are really good, interesting and memorable. The story pulls you in right away and keeps you engaged. Overall its one of the best games I have played. It has its flaws, but nothing that would ruin your experience. Overall I give it 9/10, and I totally recommend it."
Positive,"GOTY 2024. Amazing game in all aspects: gameplay doesn't get boring, visuals are stunning, sound design and OST are marverlous. The only downside is the performance, sound sometimes lags behind the gameplay/video. Also the translation isn't available fully depending on the language you use. Other than that the game is easily 9/10."
Positive,"""- Started the game- See monke with armour looking at the horizon- Monke jumps- Rides a freaking cloud just like Goku- Stops in front of an army- Me afraid, monke not afraid- God gay dude says monke is an idiot- Monke laughs- Monke starts to beat the shit out of the gay god- Gay god flees from the fight- Monke mountain getting destroyed- Me sad, monke angry- We bring them to the forest- We now bird, bird flies- Gay god now bird too- Something happens and monke loses his power of bird- Oh no- Monke defeated- Many years later, we gather with other apes and listen to the history of master monke- We learn that the true monke is the friends we make along the way- I drop the controllerAbsolute Cinema"""
Positive,Legendary game!!! Must play!!
Positive,"Best story ive ever played, so far"
Positive,"100% COMPLETE. for the monkey king!!!!Just WOW!Please bring some DLC, I'll be back for more if you bring it game was so fucking good, but those animations after chapters was just too crispy"
Positive,Game very good. Bonking things with a stick is a lot of fun.
Positive,"Wu Kong is an incredible game with stunning visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5. The atmospheric design is immersive, and the gameplay is both captivating and well-executed. Wu Kong has beautiful and captivating environments, but the open-world access feels somewhat restricted but In my opinion, it’s definitely worth playing!"
Positive,"Review after secret boss + True Ending A Lasting Impression The opening for this game is pure cinema. An action game showing you why it is called as such. We see right from the beginning an incredible set piece leading into the preamble for the story to follow along with the perfect title drop at its end.  Core Gameplay Its a boss rush. Those expectation are set right from the very start. You go to an area, fight some mobs, loot some treasure maybe find some secrets but ultimately you end up fighting a boss, health bar  + name and all. There are LOTs of these. So many in fact that it could very easily have been a repetitive and boring experience. But not with this game as almost every single boss in the game is unique, feels fresh and something you have not fought before. I saw attack patterns and strings of all sorts and scales throughout the 6 chapters this game has and never once was i bored, a testament to the well paced nature of progression. Exploration felt rewarding rather than taxing. Player Agency and Difficulty The ability to freely respec your talent points, Celestial Medicines and Relic choices with no downside is such a huge QoL feature which i'm very glad for. It enabled true freedom with your playstyle and i never felt the need to min max my choices or risk being inefficient. Something i'm sure a lot of people are tired of having to worry about.The game is not that difficult if you are even slightly familiar with action games and upgrade your gear from time to time. Secret areas inside of a chapter contain specific key items to counter that chapter's end boss. You can simply choose to not use said item if you want a harder time. That being said there are a few fights which will knock you off your high horse every now and then, namely Yin Tiger and Yellow Loong. Those fights while being challenging, never felt unfair. Huge W in my book.  Presentation and Detail I feel like this part is where it truly went beyond everyone's expectations. The quality of animations and motion captures is up there with the very best of the industry. I am not Chinese. I do not understand a significant portion of the references and story beats shown off in the game. But you don't need to be intimately familiar with the source material to appreciate the sheer amount of love they put into presenting forth a part of their literary culture to the world. They did this  while keeping the game fun for all.  The varied styles of animated cutscenes at the end of each chapter and detailed drawn depictions of the monsters and characters we come across in the game, done in an historical art style show the passion they had for this project. Performance and Polish Other than Unreal's #StutterStruggle, actually quite decent? Lmao? In 2024? Getting a functional PC port these past few years is not something people can take for granted anymore. This game at least delivers on that front. I would like to see a more graceful transition when going to the Low settings because when they said Low settings. THEY MEANT IT. Game looks ass at anything below Medium. This game did promise the high end graphics experience and i think they achieved their target, Lumen GI + the lushness of the environments with the very high level of vegetation density makes the game really visually impressive. I heard that the dev team went out to real life shrines and monasteries in China to scan them into the game as the Unreal asset store did not have Chinese temples suitable for the game. Something which really pays off in Chapter 3 and the final boss fight of that story.  Return to Monke Turns out faithfully and respectfully adapting a very well known and established story while making it a fun experience without interjecting your own socio-political commentary into it is a recipe for success. What a shocker! Some say IGN and other western games journalists are still reeling in disbelief at this discovery.    Verdict Deserves a full price purchase, no brainer if you are looking for an action game with no BS micro transactions, season passes and multiple announced DLCs before the game is even out. Its some of the best in the genre. I don't need to say much more, the game will do that for you. What an incredible debut title from Game Science in the major PC/Console space. Its so very rare for a game to live up to the promises and expectations from its promotional trailers but this game went one step further and delivered something even better. 10/10"
Positive,"runs flawless on my RTX 3080 in recommended settings with RTX off. The game is a serious GOTY contender. The graphics are breathtaking, combat is pitch perfect. Some polishing is indeed required related to texture glitches (minor), but overall, it is an experience I will never forget!!10/10 Highly Recommended"
Positive,People rag on it for not being testicle twistingly difficult but like not every game has to be like that. My only complaint is enemies aren't really that aggressive so you get lots of free hits that don't really feel earned.
Positive,I just never knew i liked Boss fights so much. In this game you get alot of them. And also you play as this hyper overpowered monkey that just destroys basically everyone in its path.
Positive,"i'm a fan now, you better make more games!"
Positive,i would gladly fight for monke mountain again
Positive,"Holy Skandha Balls! Game Science really delivered, 7 years in the making, a masterpiece. Very happy and proud to see a story that every Chinese person knows, influenced Dragon Ball and Naruto, brought to life with such great care and passion, and despite all the nonsense game journalism, so widely loved by players. Graphics 9.5/10 - The cinematic is STUNNING, the details are breathtaking, every strand of hair, every blade of grass, so vivid.  Sometimes instead of sprinting through the game, I find myself slowing down just to take in the view. They scanned some of the actual historical sites in China to put in the game. Some minor glitches and camera angles issues but very negligible.Combat 9.5/10 - love the fluidity, how agile the character feels, fitting for a monkey. A decent amount of skills and items to upgrade but not requiring you to spend hours thinking how you want to spec out your build. Love that you can reallocate skill points at any time. The magics and transformations feel useful but not OP. It's basically a boss rush so this part of the game is the bread and butter. I see some folks giving up on the game, because they get stuck on a certain boss. Usually that means you missed some side quests and key items/upgrades. I don't have godlike reflexes but I find that with the right gears and tactics, plus some patience, most bosses are not too bad, at the time of the review I am in Ch 5. Soundtrack 10/10 - Oh man just fantastic, Celestial Symphony is actually the soundtrack of the Journey to the West show from the 80s so love how they pay homage to that. Some really cool showcase of folks style music and instruments like that headless guy in Ch 2.Story 10/10 - Knowing Chinese and having some basic understanding of the Journey to the West background story definitely improves the enjoyment of this game, as some of the lores in the journal entries of each character/boss can be cryptic and assumes some prior knowledge of the JTTW, the power structure in that world between the gods, and monsters. Also the English translation is not doing the source material justice. Character Designs 9/10 - It's truly amazing the direction they took with some of the characters. Bajie is quite different from the original description, but I like it. The bosses design are a mixture of traditional and cool, with some modern aesthetics. Erlang has a pretty but very punchable face lol. All the female casts, both human based and AI generated are gorgeous, I know 4th sister is the most popular, but Kang Jin Star just does something special for me. Room for improvement: 1. Definitely need a map lol, especially ch 2 and 3, for the directionally challenged. But I understand that with a map, it takes the player's attention away from the details in the environment, which is gorgeous to look at.2. Some kind of visual representation of the wall of air would be good. Later part of the game some areas actually let you fall to the death, but you can't really tell the difference until you fall off haha.3. While the magic that lets you turn to stone effectively is the parry for this game, but I would like to be able to use that cloud step and parry, and not either or. Overall 9.6/10. Definitely getting the DLC if they are making them."
Positive,"So proud of this game, its a work out of love, showing why video game is counted the 9th art of the mortal world.10/10 no brainer."

Positive,Monkey GoTY 2024 !
Positive,Monkey whack people with staff very good
Positive,"The combat in this game is immensely satisfying, intuitive, and responsive. The enemies are well-designed, and the bosses are spectacular. The world is visually stunning, though the game could benefit from better performance/optimization. I wish the developers hadn’t restricted spells to a specific button, as this limits the potential for more diverse combos—a rather unnecessary constraint, in my opinion. Additionally, the game suffers from the same skill tree issue seen in games like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, with too many incremental upgrades such as “increase attack/magic/speed by 2.5%” or something of the sort.CURRENT RATING: 9.5/10This game has the potential to be a perfect 10/10 if performance issues are addressed, as lag can occasionally disrupt the experience, particularly during boss encounters. Additionally, removing the restriction on magic spell button mapping would greatly enhance gameplay flexibility."
Positive,great game infuriatingly fun fights
Positive,"The graphics and atmosphere are pure masterclass, the story is endearing (ps: the pig), the fights are diverse, and there are no bosses like each other. The game design is absolutely perfect. It deserves the title of GOTY."

Positive,"The game is amazing, and considering this is my first game in that type of style that I really enjoyed, and I do recommend this game to everyone, it's worth the time and the money and 100% exceeds a lot of games out there.

Positive,"10/10 easily my favorite game this year. Had a lot of fun with it. Genuinely just pure VIDYA enjoyment. You can tell the devs really put love and care into the whole Journey to the west mythos and its just a blast to play. I ofc had some issues with it which I've noticed I care more about the more I enjoy a game because seemingly they detract from an otherwise near perfect experience. For starters, the invisible walls in this game are insane. Sometimes you expect an invisible wall and it isn't, and vice verse. Because of this shit, I checked EVERY corner of the map, tried falling from every ledge lmfao. It was crazy and took away from what is otherwise a very fun world to explore.Secondly, and this is something I generally ignore. DD2 was bad at this too but I didn't mind, low framerate has never bothered me much. But this went way beyond that. This shit was high on drugs 90% of the time, and would FREEZE randomly whenever it wanted which as you can expect can be very annoying in fights because while the screen freezes for 1-2 seconds, the game keeps playing so you essentially have to mash the buttons and pray to god its working. And this didn't even happen once or twice, it happened every single time I played this game. Hell every 5-10 minutes, at least some spam of freezes randomly. I've never seen optimization this dogshit in so long, and speaking of, my PC was nearing 100 C temps cuz of this shitAnyway those are just my biggest gripes with it, the rest is just praises after praises. When the game wasnt released, I remember thinking how this game had 80+ bosses and that most of them won't feel unique. I was gladly wrong. This shit has an insane roster of fun bosses (and some repeats but who cares), all of which are brimming with a unique personality and are fun to fight. Admittedly, this game wasn't hard (ive yet to fight Erlang) and the most I died to was that one fishing Loong on the turtle I believe. About 4-5 deaths. Oh ig 12 fucking deaths on the first Wandering Wight also count. But yea, overall not much challenging which is fine, I never viewed it as a soulslike, went in expecting a fun action adventure game and that's what it was. Speaking of, I couldn't help compare it to ff16 as a result. The combat is very basic in hindsight and ik varied combos exist but then you have to swirl2win which just sucks ass, compared to the other 2. Nonetheless, I didn't mind it, hell I didn't even switch from the OG spirit till the end of the game lmfao. But yea, from the beautiful environments, to the great bosses, very fun combat, some of my favorite videos at the end of a chapter, this game was a baja blast from start to end."
Positive,"Great action game based on Chinese mythology which brings an excellent and engaging story, amazing visuals and a fun combat system with rewarding progression. Recommended and definitely a demonstration that really good games can be developed in this era and not necessarily depend on trends and forced ideologies to make it work."
Positive,Monkey go brrr 10/10
Positive,Lot of monke
Positive,monkey game good
Positive,"Great game love from China . This game ,gift for the world, is exactly Chinese 3A game in the world . I hope 　black myth wukong shows our supreme spirit that is not afraid of power and dare to fight from justice and fairness . black myth wukong did it ."
Positive,"Back then when the first bits and pieces of information about Black Myth: Wukong dropped, I honestly thought this couldn't be real. Like a pipe dream more or less( looking at you ==> The Day Before) But man was i wrong. This is real and better than i would have ever imagined. Excellent Singleplayer experience for a fair price and no micro transactions. Highly recommended!"
Positive,"This game, being single player and ""fairly"" linear, has some good qualities. Its Story Rich, has alot to do with Mythology and has a really good combat style. Does it have some traits from the Souls games? Yes! Is it hard like Souls games? Yes, but quite a few bosses are learned and you can eventually beat them. Comes with alot of secrets (that are easily missed) and has replay value.Cinematics? Are friggin amazing. I definitely recommend this game, I havent quite finished it yet, but from what I have seen and done? It is well worth it :)"
Positive,"Don't think about it, just pull the trigger!  This is an exceptional game, graphically, cinematically, and most of all its *fun* & *challenging* without any gotcha micro-transactions!MONKE STRONK!"
Positive,Good game! I will pass it to my spring
Positive,"Just got the normal ending, this game is a cinematic masterpiece GOTY for suremonke"
Positive,25hrs in not even close to being done with my 1st playthrough but having a blast! Can only recommend to try it out for yourself
Positive,Wukong the GOAT

Positive,good good game
Positive,"Mandarin review below :) (in relevance order)+Enemy design:Whoever designed the bosses made me, (a westerner who's never been acquainted with Chinese mythology), get interested in its deities.+Environmental design:As someone who spends half his time in 3D software trying to composite environments and model things, I really notice how Game Science’s creed in representing the vastness of Asian landscapes and Taoism/Buddhism scenery is something Western game developers don’t really put much attention to when representing our own culture.+Combat:Combat is fun from the get-go. I’ve never played God Of War (Remake) but I’ve seen gameplay of it and it looks like the most adjacent game made by The West. Anyways, I really like the fact that you can get to have different builds but you don’t have that much freedom over it (less than a Souls game but more than Sekiro), and I really appreciate streamlining the gameplay in a way that doesn’t overwhelm some people.Transformations and spells are a nice way to evolve gameplay that’s been repeated over and over again. It never got old for me, and it was challenging from the start.Art:I really appreciate that this game had its own ‘wiki’ inside the game explaining the folklore around an enemy. Illustrations are on top of their game, and it really shows how Game Science honored and put love into representing Chinese mythology.--- (in relevance order)-Narrative: I’m sure Game Science didn’t think this game was only to be sold in China but on a worldwide scale. It can be hard for someone who hasn’t read Journey to the West or is not acquainted at all with Chinese mythology or folklore to catch up with the message the game is trying to convey. I took my time to read the wiki inside the game and enemies’ descriptions, but it can get confusing at times. I plan to watch a video over the novel that the game is about, but that shouldn’t be a must.-Level design:As much as I liked the environmental design (which is totally different than level design), I really have to say that some areas in the game are very confusing to travel through. Thinking you can go somewhere but you hit an invisible wall, not having an idea where to go because there are so many paths ahead, and the color palette in some areas is very monochromatic, leading to not seeing anything highlighted, are some problems I encountered when playing Black Myth: Wukong.-Hitboxes and enemies' HP:Large enemies' hitboxes and some bosses HP pool can be bullsh!t sometimes. Hitboxes are not really consistent with large bosses and some bosses' HP pool can be so big that the fight ends up being more of a resource battle rather than skill based. ---This is a nice game to play. I waited nearly 4 years since I watched the first teaser, and I’m grateful that it exceeded my expectations. Playing this game made me think that China has a big opportunity to overtake the game industry or at least gain its place in The West.Hopefully, we see more from Game Science and more Chinese developers rise from this game’s success.--------------------------------------------------------- （按重要性排序）+敌人设计：设计这些Boss的人让我这个（从未接触过中国神话的西方人）对其神灵产生了兴趣。+环境设计：作为一个花费一半时间在3D软件中尝试合成环境和建模的人，我真的注意到，Game Science在表现亚洲广袤的景观和道教/佛教场景方面的信念是西方游戏开发者在表现我们自己文化时并未给予足够关注的。+战斗：战斗从一开始就很有趣。我从未玩过《战神》（重制版），但我看过它的游戏演示，它看起来是西方最接近的游戏。不管怎样，我真的很喜欢你可以进行不同的构建，但你并没有太多的自由（比魂类游戏少但比《只狼》多），而且我非常欣赏这种在不压倒某些人的情况下简化游戏的方式。变身和法术是进化重复玩法的好方法。对我来说，它从未变得无聊，从一开始就具有挑战性。艺术：我非常欣赏这个游戏在游戏内有自己的“百科”，解释了围绕敌人的民间传说。插画也做得非常出色，真正展示了Game Science如何用心和热爱去表现中国神话。 （按重要性排序）-叙事： 我相信Game Science不只是想把这款游戏卖给中国，而是面向全球市场。对于那些没有读过《西游记》或者对中国神话或民间传说一无所知的人来说，要理解游戏试图传达的信息可能会很困难。我花了时间阅读了游戏内的百科和敌人的描述，但有时还是会感到困惑。我打算看一个关于这部小说的视频，但这不应该是必须的。-关卡设计：尽管我喜欢环境设计（这与关卡设计完全不同），但我真的不得不说游戏中的某些区域在探索时非常令人困惑。你以为可以去某个地方，但你撞到了一个看不见的墙壁，不知道该去哪里，因为前面有太多的道路，而且某些区域的色彩搭配非常单一，导致什么都看不见突出。这是我在玩《黑神话：悟空》时遇到的一些问题。-判定框和敌人的生命值：大型敌人的判定框和一些boss的生命值有时真的很糟糕。大型boss的判定框不太稳定，有些boss的生命值可能大得离谱，导致战斗更多地变成了资源消耗战，而不是技能对决。这是一款值得玩的游戏。自从看了第一个预告片以来，我等了将近4年，我很感激它超出了我的预期。玩这个游戏让我觉得中国有很大的机会超越游戏行业，或者至少在西方获得一席之地。希望我们能看到Game Science的更多作品，也希望更多的中国开发者从这款游戏的成功中崛起。"
Positive,A GOTY Material fr 🔥
Positive,i like this game like i didn't know you can play as seru like damn
Positive,"This isnt a story about journey to the west.Its a myth about a monkey ascending to become wukong and wukong fans should play it.Pros: 1. Smooth combat (responsive soulslike, you get rewarded for being aggressive, you punish enemy openings at the right timings)2. Large Variety of Enemies (all enemies are different. only 3-4 repeats which are rarely overlapped)3. Good graphics/immersive environment/art4. Actual good stuff rewarding exploration (sometimes its an entire area and numerous bosses)Cons.1. No Map despite having too many big areas to explore2. Invisible walls (mildly annoying to constantly test jumping to check for hidden areas -> use google to make your life easier)3. Attacks from bosses can be too instant, you are dodging in anticipation and not in response (makes the boss fights feel bullshit/unsatisfying at times)4. Interrupted spells going on CD when hit while casting, can be annoying esp when its a long animation and has long cd8/10"
Positive,great game :D
Positive,NEXT LEVEL .
Positive,nhu  loz
Positive,this game is amazing
Positive,"monkey see, monkey do."
Positive,It lives up to it.
Positive,Super fun and grindy
Positive,"Excellent fighting gameplay, beautiful visuals and so many bosses. Like, just so many. And they're good, too!One big downside is the level design, which is a straight line filled with invisible walls, so you don't feel like you are in the (beautiful) environments around you. Instead, it feels like a Disneyland ride where you go in a straight line and the decor is there to give the impression of a world around you, but none of it is interactive. But it's overall a small downside in an otherwise amazing action adventure masterpiece."
Positive,"I love the game really but there is one thing that is driving me crazy and is the drop rate, I mean Im spending a lot of time just trying to farm one simple Item, and also the part when you rest and think that the plant is going to be there but know what? It didn't! bc you need to wait 30 minutes for the respawn and TRY to get the item.PDT: It's a pretty good game but fix that part pls"
Positive,"Stunning visuals, smooth and great combat, and breathtaking animations between chapters. The last boss fight felt like pure cinema, and some of the other bosses were just as good. Overall, it was epic. Easily a 10/10 experience."
Positive,I spent three hours fighting a 20ft tall jacked sword wielding tiger in a literal pool of blood. Best thing I've played all year.
Positive,"Good game, 10/10 MONKE"
Positive,"It's a great game.  I am a huge fan of Journey to the West as a caveat, although, you don't really need to be familiar with the story to enjoy this game.Pros:- Lots of boss fights, with a good variety of boss mechanics- Streamlined game play, you don't lose xp on death, so you are encourage to keep trying without very little penalty (I have 900hrs in DarkSouls 3 so I know how frustrating that can be) and you can respec at any time no cost.- Not much space between boss fights, while some might enjoy the exploring aspects, I really liked how you do a small section of exploring at a time and right back into the boss fight- Lots of reasons to do NG+, I think I enjoy the game more on my 2nd and 3rd playthrough vs the first.- Good mix of play styles and builds that all have their pros and cons and are definitely stronger or weaker in different boss fights and exploration sections- Absolute banger of songs in Chapter 2Cons:-the Jank, there are a few issues with invisible walls, proximity issues with certain bosses/fights (can't get close enough to hit boss' in some instances), and hit detection on by your character and enemies.      - Feels like you never know what is a dead end or if this ledge will let you jump off it.  while at times it is helpful, it is so inconsistent it creates a bit of confusion over where you can go and what you can/can't do.      - the weapon reach on your character needs a bit more help on certain boss, at times you will be as close as possible to a boss, but will miss 1/2 your swings (invisible wall around them blocks you from getting closer)      - the verticality of enemy attacks is a bit off, I can't tell you how often I would be miles over head of an enemy and they'd swing underneath me and still hit me.  Make it hard to know what is a safe timing and what isn't, sometimes i'd jump over it, other times no, with no real indication of what is going to cause it.  Vice versa, you will often miss an attack/hit even though your weapon clearly goes through an enemy-  Boss'/enemies have some pretty bad indicators of attack timings (or if a move is really an attack).  Many have 50/50 moves where you don't know which or how quick an attack will come at you.  Part of this, is that enemies tend to ""zoom"" towards you to instantly get in range of you, no matter how much spacing you create.  On the flip side, your character doesn't really get this attribute (out side of a few skills that ""help"" do this, but it isn't 100%) that being said, the game is forgiving enough in combat to make this less and issue and something you just have to adjust to.  Similarly, you don't really have a good indication of what will or will not stun/knock back an opponent, but again, you get a feel for this as the game gives you a lot of opportunities. - Some of the quest lines and mechanics are kind of obscure and the game doesn't really explain a whole lot so you kinda have to guess at a lot of things or look up a guide.  Having some obscure miss-able content is a drawback as it just doesn't seem to be needed in a game like this as NG+ already has a lot going for it you don't really have to lockout boss fights, items, and achievements through some pretty arbitrary actions. - the beginning of Chapter 3 is a low point in the game, so don't give up there, it gets significantly better 1/2 way through chapter 3 (you can unlock something pretty critical to the game play here). kinda feels like that thing should happen earlier in the chapter, but it is satisfying finally unlocking it.People are comparing this to God of War and Dark souls games, but feels like those are not really great parallels.  The Ninja Gaiden games (xbox era) seem a closer fit, but you can tell the game takes in influences from a lot of different action/adventure/rpg games, so you an look at specifics and draw different conclusions.  Overall, I enjoyed this game way more than I expected to, even with the hype.  Few games have grabbed me like this one, and after 70+ hours I unlocked all the achievements."
Positive,You have to experience this piece of gold for yourself.Very smooth game play. Well polished and finished game on launch.
Positive,EVERYTHING IS AMAZING WITH THIS GAME
Positive,Just buy it and pretend to be ill and don't go to work!! Thank me later !
Positive,"Honestly I'm not proud being Chinese for many reasons but when I heard the leitmotif of Journey to the west wukong theme my insides cried a little bit, for once I'm proud of something that's made in China.This is single-handedly best piece of media representing the chinese culture right now, even more it's also single-handedly everything the current gaming industry should be producing in every conceivable way. 0% bullshit 100% master piece.This is a piece of art while the average AAA game these games are consumable products, this is a once in a generation game that maybe won't happen again."
Positive,What a game!
Positive,Black Myth: Guang Zhi - He's not Wolf - He's GOAT
Positive,"""Summon Ten Monkeys""""Give Game 10 Thumbs up""Fantastic game, Visually amazing, Gameplay fun as fuck.Big recommend!"
Positive,"Easier than any Miyazaki gameAwesome animations and effectsCutscenes even betterNone of west-rainbow-shit in the game where you are on a journey to the WestBosses and their interactions with character on another lvl, especially the last main boss and secret boss"
Positive,"great gametook me 36 hours to beat it but I have lots of things left undoneit's quite unique I'd say, has some soul like elemnts combined with rpg stuff, definetly different from your typical soul like gamehas some problems like the hitboxes for enemies are sometimes garbage and your attacks don't hit them and beacuse is made in UE5 it takes a NASA PC to run it at max settings but otherwise game is really good"
Positive,"In my opinion this games rating here does not reflect its quality properly apart from graphics, music and mythology. The actual gameplay gets tiring after two to four hours.Positive: Stunning Graphics, fluid gameplay, nice style and myth if you are into it, lots of boss and miniboss fights, shorter areas than a typical souls game, unique boss fighting styles, bosses are either easy (0 - 2 deaths) or medium (3 - 10 deaths) which makes for continous progressNegative: Boring ass combo system, fighting small enemies in areas between bosses is lame and repetitive and should have been left out entirely, different timings of very similar moves in combos and unnecessarily delayed moves only to make first tries harder (you can still kill quite a couple of bosses first try if your intuition guides you accordingly and its not as fked up as for example ds3 last boss)Graphics: 11/10Myth stuff: 11/10Boss variation: 10/10Music: 10/10Boss mechanics: 7/10Level design: 5/10 (graphics excluded)Wukong combat: 5/10"
Positive,"Whelp I've completed the game once and thoroughly explored the content it has to offer.I'll be reviewing this as a long time soulslike player. In general I highly recommend the game, even though I'll thoroughly explain some of the issues I had I still rate this on par with Nioh. And I consider Nioh and Nioh 2 to be my 3rd favorite souls game, right behind Elden Ring and Bloodborne.Pros:- Amazing storytelling- Graphic fidelity is some of the best out there- Optimization, one of my favorite parts of this game is how it looks so good yet still runs so smoothly- Most bosses are visually amazing- Easy to use and understand systems outside of combat (upgrading, gear etc.)Cons:- Difficulty, now I don't have too many issues with it in general but there are some weird difficulty spikes and dips that felt kind of awkward. For the most part besides the wandering wight I didn't feel very challenged until about halfway chapter 3 after which it goes down again until the end of chapter 4. As I said quite awkward when it comes to challenge.- Chapter 6.... Oh man I have so many mixed feelings here. I believe it has 2 of the best bosses not only in the game but as a soulslike boss. However outside of those 2 chapter 6 is filled with gimmick bosses and bosses that have very awkward fights. Can't say much without spoiling but what I mean with awkward is that they throw stuff at you that isn't necessarily challenging just very unfun to counter and just ends up being a frustrating experience.- Game bricked, The biggest con, which I'm not sure is on the game or my current pc. I wanted to start my New Game + run after finishing the game however after playing for 10 minutes it crashed my pc. Now every time I load the save file it crashes my pc. So I wasn't able to get my 100%. I don't know if this is my pc since it is old and has been having issues however this full on crash only happens when loading that save therefore I still would recommend it even after this issue."
Positive,"Best game, this has to be game of the year 2024"
Positive,Honestly just insane
Positive,i love monke
Positive,"Aside from air wall and sometimes camera angle, everything is perfect from graphics, music, combat and culture, story line need to do research as it does not only limits based on single Journey to the West it also refers to different versions and other Chinese Mythology."
Positive,"I know that CAPCOM doesn't represent the entirety of Eastern game studios, but as a Westerner, it is the studio that has the most name recognition. CAPCOM games can be charming but also host levels of jank across their titles that after all this time seemed intentional. That level of jank isn't my cup of tea, and in my ignorance, I thought that CAPCOM's development mantra was indicative of all game studios operating in Asia.Then Game Science came along with its Samadhi Wind and blew my stupid opinions away. Black Myth is not perfect, and perhaps it's not for everyone, but it's a solid AARPG equal to the sum of its parts. I had no interest in this game until a reviewer that I trust gave it a shot, and as a filthy gweilo it's one of my favorite games of '24. Key points:-Souls LITE. Some of my early frustration came from expecting combat to be as finely tuned as Elden Ring or a pure souls game. It ain't. Some of the bosses cheese to win. There's an ability in your rotation that you become so reliant on that optional bosses will dispel it and make fun of you for its use. I found the difficulty just slightly below the Valkyries from GoW. I'm also old, so YMMV. -It's a boss rush. Some of the launch reviews understated how boss-centric the game is. The reality is that progression is directly tied to your ability to beat down on homies with a health bar.  -Story. I read Journey to the West in college and have a cursory knowledge of what is going on as I play through the game, but the reality is that Chinese mythology is esoteric as shit and Westerners don't have the same connection to the source material. You're going to get some contextual clues through dialogue about story beats but it isn't done as deftly as Elden Ring. You're going to be confused. That's what Google is for. Better still, there are members of the Chinese community who are taking the time to write guides that better explain what's happening. Having to do a book report may be a deal breaker for some, but for me, it was about the same amount of ""huh?"" as the lore in Elden Ring. -Linear. This isn't an open-world game. It opens up after the First Chapter, but it never approaches the level of freedom that you'd expect from modern AARPGs. I didn't mind this so much, but the lack of a mini-map did make the completionist in me angry because it made it much harder to look for secrets. I'm fairly sure that this was an intentional choice to encourage multiple playthroughs. The art team deserves a special shout-out. The game beautiful in terms of graphical fidelity, but the character designs, environments, even the way that the characters move is stunning. They borrowed from GoW in how chiaroscuro was used to frame cinematics and the result is just...*chefs kiss*. The transitional scenes between each chapter are hand drawn, and in one case so far, stop-motion animated and are gorgeous. You can tell that a lot of thought and pride went into the design, and the entire piece screams mystical, old, and slightly alien. If there's an argument for games of art, this game enriches that argument. I know it's the Internet in 2024 and everything is terrible. Even some of the comments in the review section are racist, or critical of China. The former is unacceptable, the latter is more nuanced. Say what you want to about the controversy, but also consider the source. And maybe opt out of data sharing. All of that being said, I do think that it's neat that there is now a solid media representation of a piece of literature that means so much to so many people, and that we as gamers get to curse at the TV while we meander through it. reject illumination become monke"
Positive,"For Game Science's first AAA game this is hella impressive, i knew nothing about Wukong except that he is a monkey king and that he's in warframe lol.i immediately got interested in the mythology and i wont lie that i may find a quick explanation about the story (the journey to the west) on you tube to learn more. absolutely mind blowing and great visuals and action 9/10 mostly due to some crashes ive been experiencing but it will get fixed overtime"
Positive,"Game changed my life. Fighting is smooth.Some bosses tend to get difficult so don't break your controller. Grab a beer, smoke a bowl and go at it again. If you know nothing about the Journey to the West, then the story will be a fresh of breath air. Graphics are amazing. GOTY unless some woke bs says otherwise"
Positive,Your childhood is awesome
Positive,Yet another review . firstly I want to thank my fellow ching pong peeps to develop this mythical game. I enjoyed playing with the wukong's stick . fully satisfied and hit my peek.
Positive,This is the best game I've ever played. Just buy it. (W glaze)
Positive,"Reject humanity, return to monke."
Positive,Banjo man 10/10
Positive,"Visuals and Story :The game has amazing graphics, great art, and an engaging story. It runs smoothly, with only minor frame drops that don’t affect gameplay much.Combat :Combat is a highlight, with exciting fight moves, cool camera angles, and great effects.Gameplay :The game offers different play styles, letting you make it easier or harder based on how you want to play.Fair Monetization ;There are no pay-to-win features or paywalls for changing builds, so you can experiment freely without extra costs."
Positive,"35 hours in, and I’m still at the beginning of Chapter 5. I thought this game was pretty linear at first, but oh gosh, there is so much to do in each chapter, so many secrets to uncover, and not to mention, the graphics are so BEAUTIFUL!The story is interesting; after each chapter, I always go to YouTube to find explanations about the lore. The combat system is the highlight here; it’s so fluid and amazing! I don’t like Souls games because they are too hard for me, but in Wu Kong, I can defeat every boss in just a few attempts. I really love the cutscenes and music videos! Highly recommended and absolutely a contender for Game of the Year in 2024!P.S. Fck those ""lack of diversity"" reviews!"
Positive,众所周知的优缺点，无非关卡设计、美术表现、预输入。就不赘述，一笔带过了。我就是说说众所不怎么知的一些点吧。先说缺点：1. 渲染方面，纯粹光栅渲染表现尚可，但和最高的全光线追踪仍有差距，可以说光线追踪和帧生成等技术给了厂商一个偷懒的理由，不愿做本身光栅渲染即可实现的效果，也有倒逼玩家更新硬件设备的嫌疑，当然这方面主要是引擎和硬件厂的问题。2. 音乐集，我购买豪华版的原因除了支持游科外，主要还是为了音乐原声集，但这个原声集不能下载也就算了，连单独一个音乐播放器都不做，难不成我在办公的时候还要开游戏听歌吗。3. CG bug，我二郎神初见CG中，存在哮天犬动画或模型缺失问题。4. 相机调教，对战体型较大的怪物时，机位被遮挡、运镜都存在问题。再说优点：1. 战斗难度曲线相对丝滑，大多数boss交互感都很不错，总体难度也不会很夸张。2. 天赋和装备系统极度高自由，免费洗点，装备自由升级，任何一副甲都可以升到红品，策略非常灵活，致使即便很多boss神经刀、快慢刀，或者高韧性、血牛，主角仍有更高的角色性能去应对。3. 纹理精细程度，非常细致，任何一件物品、甲胄、武器，细节刻画到位，精致感十足。4. UI交互，尤其是天赋系统的UI，可以选择洗单独一个系列的点或者全部的点，很方便，如果能自由加减一个点就更好了，也更符合本游戏“极度自由的天赋系统”这一目的。事实上，我说的这些优缺点都无关痛痒，没这四条优点，它依旧是国内游戏界的里程碑之作，没这四条缺点，也不会多卖出几份。即便抛开它对民族文化的影响来说，这个价格和内容质量，已经没什么好说的了，预定一波TGA年度最佳吧。
Positive,just buy it
Positive,"11/10 monke game, hope dlc comes soon to play more monke"
Positive,"Fun game so far, had some performance issues but they were resolved after updating my drivers. excited to play more!"
Positive,"This game is fantastic. It's amazing, and I love it very much.It's got extremely good combat with hard-hitting sounds, lots of enemy variety and boss variety, cool spells, beautiful areas with lots of secrets and stuff to fuel my corner-hugging brain, sick cinematics and awesome art. I get the benefit of looking up where Journey to the West is referenced in characters, areas, arts, and things and it's astounding how much effort and thought went into the little details and being faithful whilst being just a fun god-damn videogame.It's just a super-fun, lengthy action game with tough challenges and great enjoyment. I enjoyed my entire time through it all. I really hope there's a DLC one day.It's worth it for the price. Expect a tough time, if you're not trained by souls-likes already. (There's no punishment for dying in this one though, notably!)"
Positive,"When I saw the first teaser trailer for Black Myth Wukong years ago, I was instantly hyped for this game, and with every month passing and every new piece of gameplay footage, my anticipation and my expectations grew, and I was a bit worried that the game might end up disappointing me... But it did not! Black Myth Wukong is easily one of the best games of the decade!The game has many ""soulslike"" mechanics, yet it's something quite unique. Not losing all your progress if you die makes it much more friendly for casual players and newcomers to the genre, while the boss fights are challenging enough to keep even souls veterans well entertained. There are tons of secrets to discover, amazing places to explore and around 90(!) completely unique bosses to fight.Visually the game also delivers an amazing experience, but you'll need top notch hardware to enjoy it in all of its raytraced glory! If you're not playing in 4K and are happy with around 60 FPS, you should be fine with any decent hardware from the last couple of years, but it's definitely not a game for potato PCs. In the 50+ hours I played so far I experienced no bugs and no crashes. So on the technical side, it's close to perfection. Sadly it has no HDR support - blacks will always look crushed and faded, but it looks to me like this was an artistic choice, yet still I would have appreciated proper HDR support in such a visually stunning Unreal Engine 5 game.Final verdict and TLDR: Game of the Year!"
Positive,This is a masterpiece!!
Positive,surprisingly good for a riot spin-off... not sure when tristana is going to ocme into play but alright alright alright
Positive,1000000000/10 Straight flawless masterpiece.
Positive,i like monke game
Positive,"This game was really fun and challenging. It felt like a mixture of God of War 2018 with souls-like elements. I have some complaints with this game tho, one that's really notable was the input lag when using a controller. There are times when I would press L1 for heal during an intense fight and my character wouldn't heal, sometimes I would catch him just holding the gourd in his hand not taking a sip. It's really annoying when you have to press for heal multiple times and the enemy lands their attack that gets you killed, feels like the game is also another enemy in the fight. Another complaint I have are the hit boxes for some bosses (Ex: the dragon in ch 3 and Erlang after he has transformed in ch 6), it's annoying when you're attacking but it's not connecting cause their hit boxes are smaller than their models. Other than these particular things annoying me while playing, this game delivers a solid and engaging experience that rewards exploring. If you're a fan of action RPGs and enjoy challenging combat then Black Myth Wukong is worth picking up. I've enjoyed my time with the game and I hope that it wins Game of the Year (it better not be omitted as a GOTY contender just because of controversies like Hogwarts Legacy)."
Positive,One of the best games in recent years. Great design and visuals. Good difficulty balance.
Positive,"Great game, just enough challenge definitly not a souls game. More like the God of War 2018"
Positive,"I experienced a lot of technical issues and crashes. I still easily give it a 9/10. If you like Wukong, or just Chinese mythology in general, you will love this game. If you have no idea about either you will probably still enjoy it. Amazing game, you really feel like Wukong."
Positive,"In Wukong, you play as a humanimal-mankey, but are referred to as the Destined One, on a mission that has you travelling 'west'. This was the limit of my comprehension of the story. Along the way, you'll traverse through beautiful landscapes and face challenging bosses. The boss fights are a real highlight with some solid animation work and mesmerizing move sets to learn. Fortunately, you are well equipped to face the challenges. I do have some gripes, though; namely, the hit boxes can be whack at times. Your character, the humanimal-mankey referred to as the Destined One, may be pressed as close as possible to the boss and still miss attacks. This is especially frustrating due to the inherit difficulty of the boss encounters. And on difficulty, while most bosses are an acceptable challenge, there are a few towards the end of the game that border on absurd. The gaming masochist in me decided to endure the grind until credits rolled, but your mileage may vary. I do not agree with difficulty for difficulties sake. Wukong's level design is fairly simple with a path-like structure that generally gives you two or three routes to explore that often circle back on each other. There are some areas that feel larger than necessary and are spread especially thin by somewhat lackluster enemy (non-boss) design. The game never approaches on tedious, but it could have benefited from tighter levels or more varied enemy encounters. Again, the real highlight in gameplay are the bosses, and fortunately, there are a lot of them. This is a game that is worth your time if you enjoy a very high combat challenge."
Positive,Just about a perfect video game. The map design is a little weird and the invisible barriers are a bit immersion breaking but almost everything else about the game is excellent.
Positive,"I never played a soul-like game before and this was my first, I found it to be very fun and enjoyable."
Positive,"this is the pov of our great ancestor, show respect and buy it"
Positive,Enough to make me wanna jump off a bridge fuck yellow brow
Positive,"Unbelievable how good this game was, with it's original teaser we got the first teaser back in 2020 I was hopeful but was 50/50 on if it would end up being good or even real. The devs have blown me away, original Chinese audio and subtitles is a great experience. On every front your team did a fantastic job and I can see the dedication you had in bringing this story to us the players. Your audio team not even just the voice actors but the general sound effects, ambiance, music have all hit the nail here, was not expecting this immersion. I've only got 3 hours played but the cycle of progression is great, I can see where I need to work on my skills based on these early bosses and your team is great at guiding us into a play style that fits the character of Sun Wukong, I see where I make mistakes because they are heavily punished and sometimes more-so than a Souls game or Elden Ring. Combat flow is superb, I cannot wait to play more, legitimately I am impressed and this should be Game of the Year. 9.8/10 at time of review, but I doubt that will change at this rate."
Positive,good game from my chinese brothers
Positive,Game of the year.
Positive,one of the best souls-like games in existence
Positive,"Review done after 100% Completion - more detailed review per category in the blacked out section.---{ Graphics }---☑ You forget what reality is☐ Beautiful☐ Good☐ Decent☐ Bad☐ Don‘t look too long at it☐ MS-DOS The Game is beautiful, the textures are all detailed, the environments are breathtaking, but also the transitions and the camera work elevate these even more. You can feel and see that the developers tried to get the most out of unreal engine 5.  ---{ Gameplay }---☑ Very good☐ Good☐ It's just gameplay☐ Mehh☐ Watch paint dry instead☐ Just don't The combat is following the ""template"" used when it comes to action rpgs. Like other games of the same genre (i.e. God of War, Shadows of Mordor etc) the player continues to add new combos, skills and some deviations to the original combo when progressing. Also, similar to some other games there are 3 different combat stances which also changes a bit the default combat, and the player can switch seamlessly between stances and make the fighting more complex or even (like I did) max out one stance and go ham with it.However, even if there isn`t a lot of complexity to this type of gameplay, the combat is very clean and there are a lot of different skills/spells that deviate how one can approach a battle which makes the gameplay interesting and fun. As for the gameplay itself, the games does not hold your hand, it doesn`t at all, there is no map, no quest indicators, you need to navigate the world yourself. Not having a map to be totally honest was a bit tedious, as for my first play through I was going back and forth and getting lost all the time and also missed some Points of Interest. As a person who likes to collect anything and everything, this made my progress a little slower. Finally for the majority of the game, the players will be fighting bosses and for this point I think the ingenuity of these bosses is very similar to Elden Ring and other souls-borne games. There were some hard bosses, there were some times were I died more times that I can count but at the same time I always enjoyed facing against a boss, learning its patterns and then defeat it. And this feeling of enjoyment is very similar to what you get when playing a souls borne game.  ---{ Audio }---☐ Eargasm☑ Very good☐ Good☐ Not too bad☐ Bad☐ I'm now deaf The soundtrack is beautiful, it has a lot of traditional Chinese melodies which obviously fits perfectly with the game. The voice acting is good but several times the audio does not match the talking character`s mouth movements which I think its because the movement was not based on the English version of the Audio and this makes sense since the game was developed in an eastern country.  ---{ Audience }---☐ Kids☑ Teens☑ Adults☑ Grandma I think everyone who like games that are a little challenging can play the game.  ---{ PC Requirements }---☐ Check if you can run paint☐ Potato☐ Decent☑ Fast☐ Rich boi☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer I have an above average PC and I played this on a 4K Monitor, the game was running on an average of 60 FPS with the graphical settings set to very high. So I think the game is optimized enough to run with a good frame rate (50/60+) on Decent gaming PC (GTX 1070 and up).  ---{ Game Size }---☐ Floppy Disk☐ Old Fashioned☐ Workable☐ Big☐ Will eat 10% of your 1TB hard drive☑ You will want an entire hard drive to hold it☐ You will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data Yeah quite a lot.... it is over 100gb and also please do not download it on an HDD, disk rotations do not keep up and the game will continuously stutter.  ---{ Difficulty }---☐ Just press 'W'☐ Easy☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master☐ Significant brain usage☑ Difficult☑ Dark Souls As stated in the above sections, the game is quite challenging, there are several bosses, one after each other. As other souls-like games, when it comes to bosses, patience is needed to first learn the pattern and the player must also be ready to die several times. It is not punishing as the Souls-borne games but its relatively close.  ---{ Grind }---☐ Nothing to grind☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks☑ Isn't necessary to progress☐ Average grind level☐ Too much grind☐ You'll need a second life for grinding Not much Grind, there might be some if you find some difficulties against a boss and you need to level up but apart from that there isn`t much grind. The only time I needed to grind a little is when I was trying to complete some achievements which required some items to drop from mobs. ---{ Story }---☐ No Story☐ Some lore☐ Average☐ Good☑ Lovely☐ It'll replace your life I liked the story, especially the cinematics. Its not the best story out there but it`s very interesting and same goes to the few quest lines available. ---{ Game Time }---☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee☐ Short☐ Average☑ Long☐ To infinity and beyond The game time is on the long side, there is alot to explore, in my case it took about 80 hours to complete the game and all the achievements. Obviously if someone just wants to complete the main story line the game time is way less, since alot of my time was spent either battling bosses (several optional) or exploring. ---{ Price }---☐ It's free!☑ Worth the price☐ If it's on sale☐ If u have some spare money left☐ Not recommended☐ You could also just burn your money This is the first high end game that the developers made since previously they were in the mobile games market and it really shows that they put time and effort into creating this masterpiece. So yes, its totally worth the price. ---{ Bugs }---☐ Never heard of☑ Minor bugs☐ Can get annoying☐ ARK: Survival Evolved☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs I only encountered a few bugs, which were not game breaking, however one npc did disappear before I could finish the quest. But this could have been intended since it disappeared after I killed the area boss so most probably is not even a bug but still quite tedious. ---{ ? / 10 }---☐ 1☐ 2☐ 3☐ 4☐ 5☐ 6☐ 7☐ 8☐ 9☑ 10 Overall this game is a masterpiece, it takes a lot from games like God of War while changing the setting and makes us explore a culture that is not quite much exposed in western games, which I really enjoyed. The combat, story, graphics and game play are very good and not repetitive which makes the game very enjoyable especially once you get the hang of the mechanicsIf you have the funds to purchase this game, I would definitely recommended it."
Positive,"Loved the gameplay and the cinematic experience, its peak. dont overthink it and just monkE."
Positive,Great game if you like god of war or any fromsoft game
Positive,The Monkey... is BackFrom the two wolves who respawned 47 times together with me.10/10
Positive,GOTY For Sure!9/10
Positive,What a game. Great year to be a monke. 10/10.
Positive,I would nominate it as the game of the year.
Positive,"Well I would definitely recommend. I’ve never played souls game or fighting game with long story. You have to kill many bosses ( you can say you’re killing bosses the whole time ) and face strong minions. I sucked at killing bosses till chapter 3 and now I’m in chapter 5 final battle with Yaksha King. Don’t feel disappointed if you sucked in game, you just have to learn from mistakes. You have to learn to dodge and know when to attack. I died at least 100 times till chapter 2 and improved my progress a lot in chapter 3. Be patient cuz most of the boss battles are long. After killing one hard boss, you will feel so much better. There is also no map so you will feel lost most of the time and don’t know where to go but you can watch YouTube for some routes and secret bosses."
Positive,"Having never played souls before I find this game incredibly hard, not so hard I want to destroy my controller - but damn hard. Of course I'm not a gamer and I don't usually review games, but the biased nonsense from the... ahem... 'game journalists...' has made me give this an honest review. Amazing. Wukong is worth every penny. The graphics are great, you fee like an anime protag when you jump or complete certain moves. You can reset your skill points at anytime at a shrine for free and it allows you to play different styles to try them out. Also if a boss is too hard you can go back beat up some mobs, get more points and get stronger. It's a linear game but the paths make it feel like a small open world at times. all in all a great game and you should play. The only bad part is I have a 14th gen intell POS chip and I had to reduce the overclocking to play without it crashing. I also had to set global lighting lower to be able to see the dark areas as sometimes it was just black on my screen. If its crashing for you download the intel xtreme utility and reduce the overclock modifier (?) I had to reduce mine to x53 before it stopped crashing. now it only happens once every few days which to me is acceptable."
Positive,Game of the Year
Positive,Great game for the first AAA Chinese game.
Positive,Honestly one of the best games I have ever played. There are a few flaws like the camera lock near walls but it doesn't take away the fun from this game. I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a new single player game.
Positive,"Finally beat the game and I must say I am still in awe at the love and attention to detail that was put in this game. The combat is superb, the lore superb, the story superb, the environments superb, the boss fights superb, and lastly the grind oh lord the grind is bitter sweet. You will work for everything worth having in this game. The secret ending is a must and at no point should you get comfortable on your firs play through, because it will be an enemy to test you resolve a some point.  Do all the side quest the rewards are always worth it. Do craft the Loong Staff ASAP, this will make your journey through chapeter 4  and 5 much easier. You will die, but easier. lol RIG RTX 40905800X 3D32 Gb Ram @ 3600ROG Cosshair VIII Hero (Motherboard)1000 Watt PSU"

Positive,"Amazing, very fun and innovative art"
Positive,"Excellent game, as someone who wasn't good at souls like (although id say this is more GoW style) the game balance was great. Really only had problems with chapter 2 end boss and chapter 6. Can't wait to play again to get the 100%."
Positive,"A great game that took me back to my childhood watching Journey to the West with my late father. Although this game is set after the story mentioned, I still feel like I am living WuKong's life growing to become a sage and making my own legendary adventure. The characters in this game are really close to the legends and I really hope there will be more to come! Hopefully there will be more from this developer introducing more Chinese legends!"
Positive,"Unexpectedly amazing. Amazing storytelling, probably GOTY"
Positive,Lived up to all my expectations from 3 years ago and then some. 10/10 would recommend even at full price. Also had by far the most bad-ass intro to a game I have ever seen.
Positive,"WOW!a game hasn't kept my attention and interest like this, in a very long time.This is my game of the year!"
Positive,So Far I have zero complaints! this game is overwhelming with graphics and story telling and the combat is chefs kiss... there are so many boss fights that you fill you cant breathe but they build your skin quickly to learn from prior mistakes. ive only just started chapter 3 so i know i have plenty to go
Positive,"Starting with the early game, I will say it is not entirely easy to get into. Especially if you have followed the game's development through trailers, you will likely be disappointed with the lack of variety in abilities or approaches you can take to combat. Additionally, for those of you who are aware of the personality and abilities of Sun Wukong: you are not Wukong. Tricks, playfulness, pranks, and quips are uncommon throughout the game, and they do not come from you. As a silent protagonist, you serve as a vessel for other characters' stories to unfold up until about 2/3 through the game.On the topic of story, it is unconventional. With chapter-based progression, Black Myth very much cordons off each set of characters into their own neatly-bundled packages. There are, of course, a few who persist from one chapter to the next, but you will find that the events of one chapter rarely connect to those of the next.Regarding those stories, they're certainly not bad. Often suffering from a lack of setup, these self-contained tales tend to pay off with big, dramatic moments one might expect from a historical drama. In later chapters, the setup and executions of these stories improves dramatically.Now for what I'm sure many of you are most curious about: combat!You have one moveset: the staff. You will get very used-to this, and will soon realize that, similar to Sekiro, Black Myth is a rhythm game. The greatest difference here is, while Sekiro is a reactive game with its rhythm set by enemies, Black Myth sees you set the rhythm. As you learn the responses, vulnerabilities, and patterns of foes, the game very much revolves around adapting your approach and attack rhythm to meet your opponents.Oh, did I mention adapting? From any of the many rest spots placed throughout the game, you can refund and reallocate everything! Though you will likely find yourself gravitating towards a particular set of abilities and transformations, the game very openly encourages experimentation.My greatest gripe is how, as the monkey king, our options for mobility and terrain traversal are woefully underdeveloped.After spending 40 hours with the game, getting to know its ins-and-outs, and meeting many of the game's secrets, I feel comfortable recommending it. As an experience that improves as you progress (in story, level design, and combat), I found it a worthwhile and enjoyable way to spend a few days. I definitely look forward to further playthroughs and hope to see more games focused on Asian myth."
Positive,"*no spoilers* I'm at the end of the third act now, but I can already say with confidence it is one of the best games released in recent years. Great graphics and detailed environment, interesting combat system with different combat stances, skills tree, crafting, fascinating setting, story and awesome cutscenes. I found the game quite challenging, but once you start to understand the combat system, it becomes much easier.   In the beginning the game seems very linear with nothing to do, but closer to the 2nd act things change a lot. Locations are getting a lot bigger and more interesting. The game highly encourages exploration of locations and there is a lot of hidden content, different side quests, optional bosses and such, even sometimes very useful game mechanics are hidden behind side quests (the hub with the blacksmith). It's not dark souls or elden ring, but something closer to sekiro + god of war, it feels like the whole game is made up of fights with bosses, but they don't feel like just an asset flip, most of them have unique visuals and move sets.    Game is worth its money, the developers have done a very good job, and such games should be supported. Definitely recommend it, 10/10."
Positive,I WANTED TO FINISH THE GAME BEFORE WRITING THE REVIEW. BUT LET'S BE HONEST THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMING EXPERIENCES I'VE HAD IN A WHILE. DEFINITELY GAME OF THE YEAR IMO. WHAT AN AMAZING ENDING. HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TRY THIS AMAZING JOURNEY TO THE WEST. LOVED EVERY BIT OF IT!!!!!

Positive,BEST GAME 2024
Positive,Happy international primate day!
Positive,love it :)
Positive,"a fabulous game, it adds a lot of interesting elements for its combat, unique upgrades for the main weapon, massive skill trees which you can reclaim the skill points for at any time to choose whichever form of combat stance you like, the bosses are exceptionally well done, you can either brute force your way through or win by patience, the game offers both ways to approach the fights and is very rewarding for being aggressive. the levels are beautifully designed, interesting elements throughout the areas you explore, and in some moments will also unlock some of the best abilities which one might not expect, like in chapter 3 you can unlock something really cool after exploring the area after a certain boss fight (not gonna mention it because it'd be a spoiler for anyone who hasn't played the game). the transformation element adds a lot to the game and also help you clutch victory with narrow margins if you're about to run out of health. the spells also add a lot to the way you approach combat. all in all an easy GOTY for the year 2024 a 9.5/10 for me personally."
Positive,"The game isn't perfect by any stretch of imagination. It's beautiful, tasteful, artful yes, but it has problems. No combos!!!Sometimes stupid, design(or is it malicious) like that dude in act 2 after you defeat the tiger. The prick guards the bridge and knocks your as off the said bridge every single time without fail... until you get red on your face and you skadoosh him whilst throwing profanities. It's not challenging, it's dumb. Another one is the following boss, the rock thing. Why there is no respawn shrine close by and you have to do a half marathon to get back to him?!? Having said that...I love the game and it's true love. I love it not because of   the good things, but even though all the bad things I still do. Technically it's like an old classic car."
Positive,Absolutely amazing game with stunning visuals. I am curious about Chinese culture and history and this is a perfect way to introduce people to China-.
Positive,Game Science keep up the amazing work!
Positive,"Suffering is the Key, but the game is so much fun. U get knocked and get u r ass whooped often, which will lead you to keep trying. Every boss fight s made personal to me XD."
Positive,"Beautiful game, combat is hard enough to be satisfying but not too hard to make it discouraging"
Positive,Really good game
Positive,this game is very easy but i almost went crazy when fighting erlang and great sage final boss
Positive,"This game introduced a fresh vibe to the gaming world with a unique system that blends the style of God of War and Souls games. The gameplay is incredibly engaging and fits the story perfectly.The world is absolutely beautiful, and the graphics need no further praise—we’ve all seen the incredible details the game delivered using the new Unreal Engine 5. Even though the development team is relatively new to AAA third-person games, they crafted a visual masterpiece. However, the game is quite demanding and could use more optimization on various platforms. Even with my RTX 4090, I had to lower some settings to maintain high frame rates.One issue I had with the world design is that when I wanted to revisit older areas, I often forgot the locations and had to retrace my steps, which was tiring. The absence of a map in the game made this process even more challenging. This alone can cause players to miss out on important content or side bosses and rewards.Additionally, some of the secret areas were a bit misleading. I wouldn’t have discovered any of them without YouTube. You know the type—where you have to perform a million steps, many of which seem random, just to unlock a specific secret location.As for the bosses, I was absolutely thrilled with the fights. There’s a great variety, and each boss has a unique combat style. Every encounter felt different, requiring you to think of specific strategies to beat them. I really enjoyed the diversity and the number of bosses.The leveling system fits the gameplay style perfectly and was engaging, pushing me to explore secret areas and hidden bosses to strengthen my character and acquire new skills. The skill tree was diverse and extensive; even after completing the game, there were still many skills I hadn’t discovered or tried. This is a good sign that I’ll continue with New Game+.The story, while not the best in gaming, was enjoyable and gave me insight into Chinese cultures and characters.The game offers multiple endings.My final rating for the game is a solid 9 out of 10."
Positive,Game is good. Monke happy.
Positive,"This game is legitimately GOTY material, and is definitely the best Soulslike (alongside Lies of P) that's not made by From Software. Indeed, I would argue that this game is superior to a couple weaker titles from From Software even.It offers plenty of tight combat, but also offers a large number of playstyles and solutions towards difficult fights, ranging from variety of spells, abilities, transformations, etc. In that regard it is somewhat similar to Nioh 2. Combined with extremely easy respecs, you are encouraged to play around with different fighting styles and spells and explore what works for you.However, this is ultimately a Soulslike. It doesn't have a difficulty slider, and if you are unaccustomed to Souls games you may run into plenty of challenges. However, similar to Elden Ring certain strategies can be utilised to cheese the difficulty as needed.The lore is based on one of the most well-known literature in Asia, and it is honestly a pretty good opportunity to explore cultures and superstitions that are otherwise rarely seen in video games, especially not at a AAA level."

Positive,"This game is basically another copy of Nioh 2. Nioh 2 is great, so that's a good thing."
Positive,"Just finished Platinum the game Right Now,And it's Time to leave my review, Astonishing Game, Great Story , Great Feels DBZ :D Great Ambience Graphics and Music, Gameplay Wise it's also really good and innovative, Price Of Course is a little too high for my taste, so if you want this game i reccomend to take it in discount, but it's worth the money tho, i thought it was a souls like, but it was not, the boss were easy almost first try all of them, except the last ones, anyways i reccomend you to buy it, since it's their first project and took a lot of years and resourcers so that in future they will make other great games like this, if i had to vote this i would give him 8/10 , game of the year ? I Don't know, maybe ?? There isn't many cool games around this year so i don't know."
Positive,"Beautiful world with great performance (4080 at 4K with RT at max, solid 60fps), engaging storyline, fluid combat, useful skill tree you can respec for free to change your build.  More of a linear type world but still plenty to explore and secrets to find, really opens up from Chapter 2 and beyond (3 and 4 are huge).Boss heavy game but some really great designs and fights that let this stand out against the likes of Elden Ring/Sekiro - it is souls-like but more forgiving with no death penalty.Really great game and gets a solid 9/10 from me :)"

Bringing light to the chinese/indian religion.has got amazing fighting mechanics and my fav part i where you get the ability to turn into any boss you have defeated before. With ray-tracing and high graphics at 66 FSR, this game looks crazy detailed. I'm gonna say a solid 9.5/10, can easily see this game as a contender for GOTY 2024."
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong is one of the best games I've played this year. The combat, storytelling, exploration, and not the mention the secrets kept me wanting more the whole way through. If you love the souls series, then chances are you will enjoy this game. Get this game if you are remotely interested or wait for a sale if you need to, but don't miss out. Can't wait to start my NG+ save :)"
Positive,"Dude, this game is so much fun! It's got this awesome combat system where you can totally switch up your playstyle and keep tweaking your skills. You can just keep resetting your build to take on all these different bosses—it's like a boss rush on steroids!The graphics and the scenery are just mind-blowing, seriously, you won't believe how detailed everything is. It's like stepping into this whole other world where you get to fight like Sun Wukong. It's just so cool!The game's difficulty is kind of a mix between those hardcore Souls games and your typical action game. You know, it's challenging but not impossible. I reckon it'll take you about 40 hours to get through it the first time around.And the combat, oh man, it feels so good! Every hit is satisfying. Plus, the music and the art are just on another level. It's like a symphony of awesomeness."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong - A Mythical Masterpiece""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a game that truly lives up to the hype, delivering an extraordinary blend of stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and a rich narrative inspired by the classic Chinese novel ""Journey to the West."" From the moment you pick up the controller, you're thrust into a beautifully realized world filled with mythological creatures, breathtaking landscapes, and an atmosphere that feels both mysterious and inviting.Gameplay: Combat in ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is fluid, dynamic, and satisfying. The game’s combat system requires skill and strategy, rewarding players who take the time to learn enemy patterns and use the abilities effectively. The variety of enemies and bosses keep each encounter fresh and challenging, ensuring there's never a dull moment.Story and Immersion: The narrative is both engaging and thought-provoking, delving deep into the lore of Chinese mythology. It’s a fresh take on a well-loved story, with twists and turns that keep players invested from start to finish. The voice acting is superb, adding to the overall immersion and emotional depth of the story."
Positive,As close to perfection that you can get. Spell binder is definitely a bit too strong though.
Positive,"This is what we as Gamers needed for a long time now. Not only it is one of the best game that came out in decades, it has been was one the most entertaining. Give us more."
Positive,"So far, so good!Very Chinese.Very Monkey."
Positive,"Update 9/30: Since the last update I have not experienced any crash. Chapter 6 is a terrible chapter though. You fly around on a cloud and need to explore an open area and find tiny bosses. It's otherwise empty except for a few bosses. There is one beetle you need to hold on to, but he throws you off and he's difficult to find again. There needs to be a map system or some way to locate the bosses. I don't like to aimlessly wander around.Frequent crashing in all aspects of the game, even though I've updated my graphics card drivers, 6950XTcpu 760032 GB RamOtherwise cool game."
Positive,It was one of the best games I have played in the last few years
Positive,MONKEY WITH STICK!
Positive,"This game is great, the battle system is very fluid. the scenery is beautiful, the story is very sad and dark but i love it."
Positive,"Make sure you beat all the bosses to get the full ending.""You can walk from the time of your youth till the time you grow old, and after that, till you become youthful again; and even after going through such a cycle a thousand times, you may still find it difficult to reach the place you want to go. But when you perceive, by the resoluteness of will, the Buddha-nature of all things, and when every one of your thoughts goes back to its very source in your memory, that will be the time you arrive at the Spirit Mountain."""
Positive,monke with big stick.
Positive,"Wukong é um jogo perfeito para quem curte desafios: difícil para novatos, mas mediano para quem já joga Souls-like. É uma mistura espetacular entre Hack and Slash e Souls-like, com cenários lindos, uma trilha sonora envolvente, belíssimas lutas e gráficos incríveis que tornam tudo muito especial.A história é muito bem contada, e o game te mantém imerso com várias batalhas e cenas em formato de vídeo. Se você, assim como eu, é um apreciador de jogos Triple-A, com certeza não vai se arrepender de jogar essa obra-prima. Se você está embarcando no mundo dos jogos mais difíceis, este é o jogo perfeito para isso. Na minha opinião, será o jogo do ano. Agora pare de procurar defeitos e vai jogar, rapaz!"""
Positive,"The game is very good, so I can't say a bad word about it. It's definitely a good title. The combat system is dynamic and works well, we have skills to use, so every fight can and should be approached very strategically. The plot and characters are well written in my opinion. The whole thing is well done. The game doesn't have any major problems or bugs, but sometimes it can turn itself off or freeze, but such things are not common, I had it maybe 4 times and that's it. As for political scandals and so on, I won't refer to them because they were artificially created to generate hatred, and as we all know, people love hatred and know how to use it as a tool to manipulate others, but this is nothing new, it's normal these days, although I admit honestly that it's very sad that people act like this."
Positive,Worthy of the hype it had!! Definitely game of the year!!
Positive,"Had a ton of fun with this game. It's very refreshing due to the setting and feels authentic due to it being made by Chinese devs. The graphics are great thanks to Unreal Engine 5. Not the best looking game Ive ever seen, but it's in top 3 for sure. The story is pretty good, though a bit confusing sometimes.The bosses are 10/10 peak cinema sometimes.Overall, a lot of fun and doesn't stress you out as much as Elden Ring due to its more lighthearted tone and stronger protagonist"
Positive,"Very nice game, visually aswell gameplay wise.Wish I had a better pc to play it on max settings to get the maximum experience visual wise :P"
Positive,Refunded because my pc is potatoand buy again on ps5this game is GOTY !
Positive,"After finishing my 100% of the game, I can confidently say that Black Myth Wukong is...good.A lot of people have already made several comparisons to other franchises like God of War, Nioh, even some souls-likes (even though this game is NOT a souls-like), so I won't get into that.Some of the highlights include:- The fidelity and visual quality of the game (both in graphics and art style, but the game is very demanding so I hope you have a good PC)- The bosses, both in quantity and variety- The end-of-chapter animations and paintings- The killer soundtrack (special shout-out to that headless guy in Chapter 2)I do have some points of criticism for the game, however, hence why I say the game is 'good' and not 'great' or 'perfect'. The game is still fun, and I really enjoyed my 50+ hours playing, but it would've been a lot better if some/all of the following were addressed.The story to me felt like it was there to get me from Point A to Point B and nothing more. It relies on the player having read the 'Journey to the West' novel to understand and resonate with a lot of what goes on. As someone who hasn't actually read it, the story didn't really connect with me. There is obviously a lot of lore involved (and you can base this solely on the sheer amount of journal entries for each character/yaoguai), but if you've never read the novel or if you're not too familiar with the players involved then the weight of the story is lost on you. If you have read the novel, this may not be an issue for you.The amount of times I ran into an invisible wall is astounding. Exploration is something I value in a game like this, and it just exacerbates the problems I have with the level design of each area. The combat is fine in the beginning, but by the end of the game it just felt very repetitive. I don't find it egregious or anything, but I would've liked a little bit more variety or intricacy to the combat mechanics.And for people who are completionists (like me), it can be a bit of a hassle to go for all achievements. Some of them require RNG drops (three of the items I needed in particular took me an hour each of farming, and yes I changed my system clock), and will almost always need some backtracking, which for games like these is never fun.Overall though, the game is good and I would recommend it. If this is Game Science's debut, then I am pretty excited for what they can bring in the future."
Positive,"Awesome graphic, emotional story. 10/10"
Positive,"its been a while since i have played a game with such a great story!! if this doesnt get game of the year, then its all rigged !!!! Gameplay - 9/10 (was not really repetitive, everyone said it is..but in my opinion its fun IG)Graphics - 10/10 (will make you forget reality)Story - 9/10 (if you read Journey to the west. Else you wont get whats going on )Characters - 10/10 (if you know, you know xD) (jokes aside, in dept lore of characters are really good)character Designs - 10/10 (Never knew anyone can think this far) !!!Soundtracks - 7/10 (good soundtracks but I ve heard better)combat - 8/10 (Not like any of the souls game but yea I would've appreciated Parry)overall it is 9/10!!! definitely GOTY worthy!!"
Positive,"The amount of heart that went into developing this game most definitely shows...This is one of those games that you complete and you left with a void that just wants more.The story, combat, graphics and depth of Chinese mythology are all phenomenal.Black Myth: Wukong could be compared to a mixture of God of War and Dark Souls,but that would be doing it a major disservice.This game was absolutely amazing and I can't wait to get into 'new game+' and complete all achievements."
Positive,"visual is so good, combat and skills are amazing. 100% my type of game."
Positive,Holy shit yes! What a game.
Positive,This game really makes you feel like a monkey with a stick
Positive,"monkey have stick, monkey kill demons with stick very fun"
Positive,Fun and great story line.
Positive,What a GAME i dont think that i played a game with this crazy graphics and quality Amazing
Positive,very sigma indeed
Positive,"After finished the whole game, I have to say the game experience was like a dream to me. I've never imagined that I can play character that I'm so familiar with, and see those relics and historic artifact presented so vividly in a game. The game makers dig so deep about the story of journey to the west and created their own story upon it, their passions were incredible.I have seen comments about the invisible border of the maps in this game, but in my opinion, this is a sacrifice to achieve a better aesthetic performance. They make scenery that look like real and some gaps and some seemingly passable routes are inevitable. I believe this is a very reasonable sacrifice because the scenery of this game is absolutely amazing."
Positive,Overwhelmingly satisfying in many ways
Positive,"Very nice game. Stunning visaulas and graphics. The game is not easy at all, need skills to beat some of the bosses so casual gamers will be in trouble and will sweat a lot."
Positive,this game has 90+ boss fights and each one is unique. A 10/10 game for sure.
Positive,"ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE! This is GOTY without a doubt. It's in my top 3 for the last 10 years. It's difficult, but not drive you mad difficult. You earn your progress but it is so nice when you finally beat the boss you had to fight 5 times. And the graphics are seriously crazy. There were times when I would just put the controller down and look at the screen. It truly is a great game and well worth it. 10/10."
Positive,"Awesome graphics, performance, and smooth animation overall make for a good experience. I like hack-and-slash games, and lately, I’ve fallen into the Dark Souls rabbit hole. This game is not a fully Souls-like game, but it definitely takes some inspiration from it. Personally, I like that it is not an open world. Those games have grown old and boring for me. I prefer linear, story-driven games lately, as I don’t have much time to spend in a sandbox."
Positive,"3 Bosses could be arguably SOULS-LIKE, rest of the game, think of NIOH + a little bit of God of War + a little bit of Hack n Slash.Stop whatever you are doing with your gaming life, play this masterpiece, embrace it, enjoy it.Then keep playing whatever you were playing.Thx China."

Positive,"Visually stunning with Lore that will draw you in intensely! Incredible experience with enemies that keep you on your toes. If you enjoyed Sekiro shadows die twice you will also enjoy this, while quite familiar it also brings something new to the genre. Pretty straightforward 100% for those achievement hunters out there. I hope you grab this game and enjoy it as much as i have"
Positive,Probably some of the best visuals and aesthetic I've seen in any game for a very long time.
Positive,Great game. Very hard
Positive,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" is definitely the most talked-about game in China in recent years. You know, in the Chinese gaming market, which is flooded with online games and pay-to-win mobile games, making an indie game was once considered a surefire way to lose money and fail. But the release of Black Myth has completely shattered that notion, showing investors the massive potential of this market. I bet in the future, China will be able to produce more high-quality AAA games that you can just buy outright!Here is the main text of the review.:Pros:1. The game features highly detailed sculpture models created from high-precision real-world scans, along with finely crafted scene modeling.2. The voice acting and soundtrack are incredibly immersive.3. It has an excellent and well-developed combat and progression system.4. There are several well-produced cutscenes, each with a distinct style.5. The game is based on the classic Chinese mythological novel Journey to the West. Many Chinese people have dreamed of becoming the Monkey King, Sun Wukong, and in a way, this game helps us fulfill that childhood dream!Cons:1. The invisible walls aren't well-defined, which is frustrating when areas that look accessible actually aren't.2. The lighting contrast is too high, and the diffuse reflection is too low, making the shadows overly dark.3. The color palette in some chapters is too monotonous, lacking visual guidance, which makes it easy to get lost.4. Some boss designs are really annoying, like General Miaoyin and the Hundred-Eyed Demon Lord."
Positive,Monke together strong
Positive,"When a game respects players, the players will do the same for the game"
Positive,"game of the year. i've not been impressed by a game quite like this in a very long time, everything about it is a fulfilling and satisfying experience. the combat isn't complicated, but its deep enough to offer variety to different play styles, and rewarding when you successfully master your monkey. before i had any small amount of comprehension i was immersed in the wildly creative approach to the story telling, this entire game is oozing with passion. the sound design is absolutely phenomenal, from the soundscapes to the ambience, the well timed music enhances the frequent and intense encounters. there wasn't a single opponent that felt recycled, so much originality i had to shed previous poor habits developed from other games that mimic barely a fraction of this games potential. overall the presentation, from the moment you hit start Wukong was on point. i'll admit by the end of it there were several bosses that gave me a solid run and frustrated me, however i welcomed the challenge with open arms and wasn't ever left feeling like it was insurmountable. a consistent complaint i have with the open world platform is a lot of unnecessary ground to cover just for the sake of expanding the world, this is a perfect example of linearity with the freedom and purpose to inspire exploration, whilst maintaining a balance. the visuals aren't particularly a selling point for me personally, though thats not to say they're beyond impressive: this exceeded any previous expectations i'd reserved about next gen gaming. no microtransactions besides the deluxe edition; which is entirely optional mind you, i genuinely hope this sets a new standard for the industry because this is going to be a game i rave about for a long time. front to back, to both casual and hardcore gamers, i can strongly recommend this purchase even at full price without a shadow of doubt"
Positive,"When I first started the game, I got bored in about 2 hours getting destroyed by a 'mini-boss' - the Wandering Wight.Took a few days off to play other games til I got bored and decided to give this game a try again.Then I pulled off a series of perfect dodges and managed to get him down to 1/5 of his health and got hooked.I learned about stamina, and focus points/build up, and how to execute timed combos/counters, and how to drink.Game got more and more complex, opening up options and playstyles, but the original starter build was so strong that I stuck to it most of the game, and just got better and better at it, I like mastery over just a few skills rather than variation of various things.Eventually I could perfect dodge, strike into counter strike, stamina and focus juggle, and fully evade boss big moves with cooldowns. Very rewarding gameplay when getting it just right.Gameplay is 1 thing. The main thing though was the story, the mystery, and the depth of motivation that reflects the human condition, and the tyrany of beuraucracy - which exists everywhere, even internationally, when people make assumptions about others through their own fears.We play as a yao guai (monster), on a mission to find ourselves, in a world of other yao guais, who recognise us, and fear us, whilst they try to emulate the righteous and holy of the heavens and seem like the 'good guys', whilst looking somewhat grotesque and scary. And we beat the shit out of them, whilst others we become friends with (who are often oppressed and hiding themselves). We also meet others who are considered bad by the heavens and are targeted for destruction whom we have to fight - and we gradually understand the similarity of our situations.This game has the basics of run right, and the depth and intrigue to go along with it. It's a breath of fresh air from all the wokeism grandstanding, talking about what really matters - it reaches into the core of the motivation of the self and others - this of course includes wokeness (but in a good way, why we shouldn't judge books by their covers, how the nature of things and how they look play into the perceptions of others, and why being good or bad isn't clear and isn't a choice of the self but would be attacked by others).Feels like I played a game and learned something for it. 10/10."
Positive,"monkey. he hab the stick, he is very quik, he hit da guy, den he fly."
Positive,"""Black Myth: Wukong,"" as the new blood of the ninth art form, incorporates Chinese cultural elements into the game's VDB as a relic backup. #no spoilers#First, its epic sense is embodied not only in the game's graphics depicting places of interest but also in the background music that imbues the game's soundtrack with an epic quality, played on traditional Chinese instruments such as the suona, sanxian, and xun. Then, the storyline, while diverging from the original Journey to the West, still resonates deeply with me.Of course, the game also has several design deficiencies, such as the so-called 'Schrodinger's invisible walls', and some character attributes and upgrade effects that are not visually apparent, which all negatively impact the player's exploration and immersion.Furthermore, the game has many easter eggs, such as hidden NPC dialogue, hidden maps, and hidden plots. Moreover, the inclusion of Chinese characters that evoke the brushstrokes of renowned calligraphers is a rare touch.Overall, the game's emergence made a lot of firsts, which is phenomenal. I sincerely hope that you like it."
Positive,so this is the dark souls of non-souls game...?!
Positive,very sigma monkey
Positive,"A lengthy game with lots of passion behind it. The characters are extremely interesting, but I think if you aren't familiar with the story and aren't Chinese it will be quite confusing. It was for me. But I pieced together bits and pieces and after a recap at the end I think I mostly understand what happened.This game has truly wonderful art direction. The world and characters are very interesting. Some moments will have you grin at them with how epic they are.There is some criticism to be had with some of the boss design, and the feel of combat. This isn't a large studio though and considering all else they accomplished its not a deal breaker but something to be aware of. Some things like input buffering feel off, the controls can feel unresponsive at times mainly in regards to heavy attacks, and consumables. I hope to see them refine their combat system if they make future titles. There is a lot to see and explore and collect, but its disappointing that in terms of weaponry there is really only two animation sets you use throughout the entire game (spear and staff) and they are very similar. The spirit system is very cool and there are many of them but In general I found such things less effective than good old fashioned melee and spellweaving . The spells are quite satisfying to use though so its got that going for it.The equipment and item descriptions are also needlessly vague. Telling things like ""increased moderately"" or ""considerably"" if you actually test some of these things you might find they do not do all that much. So in that regard it's kind of a shame that I do not think this game will have the kind of replayability some titles in the genre have with equipment changing up, different builds etc.All that being said, as their first AAA quality action RPG this game is done very well and you can feel the passion behind it. I hope they continue making games in this vein on other Chinese mythology and folklore or maybe even a sequel / dlc to this game.So far game of the year for me.  Does need a MAP though."
Positive,I would say this game beyond my expectations...for me this is GOTY
Positive,"Amazing game so far, the right amount of challenging, graphics, and story. Play with a controller and so far its been bug free on my 3080"
Positive,"I've never been so frustrated but also had so much fun than playing this game, I really enjoy playing this game but the bosses sometimes make me feel like a little baby playing video games. But like life, you figure out a way and persevere!"
Positive,"An exciting experience for anyone that enjoys a solid challenge without the hopelessness that can follow some souls-like games. While this title does have certain aspects of a souls-like that makes it familiar to anyone who has experience in that genre, to me Wukong play more like a fast paced action boss run."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a fun, but flawed action game with light RPG elements (that is definitely NOT a Soulslike). First, the presentation and visuals. Absolutely spectacular. Game Science made one of the best looking games I've ever seen. The graphics are stunning. The visual detail and fidelity are something to behold. Not to mention the phenomenal design of enemies, bosses, NPCs, characters, etc. Everything about this game is eye candy. Each chapter also concludes with a unique animated short in different styles that blew me away. Truly, incredible what the developers did here. I don't have much negative to say outside of the performance being a bit all over the place especially during fights with lots of particle effects on the screen (Yellow Loong looking at you). Second, level design. It's...not great. Each chapter they try to do something unique and it's admirable, but it doesn't quite pan out. This is in fact Invisible Walls: The Game. In a game advertised as having secrets, it is baffling that they made so many areas look explorable only to gate them off with an an invisible wall. And, some of the secrets are where invisible walls usually are which leads to some frustrating moments wondering why there isn't some kind of mini-map or more obvious ""oh hey look over here"" signs. Speaking of needing a map, this game desperately needs one for certain chapters (especially Chapter 6). The game is linear for the most part, but delves into semi open world at times and it doesn't really do it very well. However, all the areas look gorgeous and while this all may not sound like a big deal, it does break immersion more often than you'd think.Third, combat. It's a mixed bag for me. Listen the combat system is quite fun...when it's working as intended. However, the combat feels a bit loose. Hit-boxes for enemies and bosses are all over the place leading to moments where it feels like it should have been a dodge or you cheated the game by getting a lucky dodge. This is especially frustrating for encounters that ramp up the difficulty like the late game and optional challenge bosses. The stagger is inconsistent with the light attack combo for the Destined One and you stagger out of any attack VERY easily which doesn't feel all that good especially if you made it to the end of a light attack combo or charged up a heavy or are trying to transform/cast a spell. Attacks with your staff lack a certain weight too which becomes more noticeable throughout the game. There's three different stances with the staff and they're all fun to mess around with, but lack a certain depth. Combat essentially boils down to attack or charge until you can pull off a heavy attack. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but a bit disappointing. Spells, transformations, and summons are fun and add to your kit instead of trivializing fights. Overall, the combat system has some issues and lacks depth, but it's fun and works well enough.Fourth, bosses. They're all visually impressive and spectacles to behold. Truly. However, their mechanics and actually fighting them is again a mixed bag. There's something like 80+ bosses so you can't expect them all to be winners. Unfortunately, I feel like there's too many bosses that aren't unique or challenging enough mechanically to be remembered. I didn't mind this, but I was hoping for more interesting bosses. There's also far too many bosses (especially after Chapter 3) are challenging in a way that isn't very fun. Yellow Loong and the second Erlang fight is a great example of this. Constantly spamming combos, unwarranted multi-phase multiple health bar fights, ridiculous tracking (can hit you from across the map so good positioning isn't rewarded) and contorting their bodies in unrealistic ways to hit you (Dark Souls 2 throwback), and unskippable scenes tied to attacks that are repeated upon multiple attempts. Some bosses also have phase transitions that damage the player and it's unavoidable which is frankly bad design. But, there are some really good fights in here and even the average bosses have their fun or cool moments.Fifth, the game's length. It's too long. Or, at least it feels too long which is the problem. Chapter 1 is a great starter chapter. Chapter 2 is great all around. Chapter 3 starts strong and lasts longer than it should, but it's good (outside of the final boss encounter being a bit too gimmicky). Chapter 4 and beyond, the overall quality takes a noticeable decline. Chapter 4 is a mixed bag that has some excellent encounters and questlines (Scorpionlord is my favorite) with some weird level design choices and a rough final boss. Chapter 5 is just boring. Chapter 6 feels experimental and VERY rough around the edges. Repeat and poorly designed bosses thrive there. Sixth, some minor quirks. This game has some abysmal drop rates that really should be patched. Missable quests, items, etc. in a game like this is never good design and I will always stand by that. The crafting system in this game is superfluous and adds nothing to the game outside of more items to collect. If you liked it in the newer God of War games, then you'll like it though. For me, it was just fluff. A lot of the skills were underwhelming. This game has an input dropping issue especially when trying to heal. This is an animation heavy game and there's no animation canceling (as far as I can tell) which can lead to frustration when trying execute specific moves due to how intricate the movements with the Destined One's staff can be at times. This game has no concept of poise (not getting staggered out of attacks) and it really should. Some of the late game bosses feel like they could use some better balancing as well.Overall, this game can be a lot of fun when the combat system is firing on all cylinders, but more often than not, it isn't. At times, it felt like watching this game would be more fun than actually playing it which is disappointing. I think this game is worth playing and experiencing as long as you go in with the right expectations."
Positive,"Updated: Finished the game  The game boasts one of the most impressive intros I've seen, stunning visuals and art. Although the combat may initially appear simple and uninspiring, it becomes dynamic and engaging once you start using the spirits, transformations, and three distinct stances together.The first chapter is relatively short and linear, but subsequent chapters open up. Each chapter is filled with optional bosses and hidden areas that are definitely worth exploring. The final optional boss offers a unique experience and unlocks a true ending. A helpful tip: upgrade your stats and gear as you progress and take the time to explore, it will make the game significantly easier.While the game is often compared to Dark Souls and Elden Ring, I'd say it blends elements of Souls-like gameplay with the combat style of God of War and Nioh 2.  It is also not a boss rush game, later chapters emphasize exploration. Unlike Souls games, this game does not penalize you for dying and you can respec for free at the shrine.  It encourages you to try out all the different spirits, transformations and stances.I don't mind the hidden walls as much, save you from wasting time exploring empty areas and accidental deaths from falling off cliffs while exploring (you could still get knocked off in certain areas). There’s no PvP zone, no worries about getting ganked by other players, no multiplayer, so all boss kills depend solely on yourself.   Most importantly, there's no micro transactions, this is a complete single player game, buy once and you get the full game."
Positive,this game is a masterpiece i enjoyed every fkn bit of it about to finish ng+ tomorrow i cant recommend this game enough i hope ppl enjoy it like i did
Positive,Game of the year!!!
Positive,"Atmospheric, full of action, beautiful, great soundtrack, polished"
Positive,Waited for 4 years and it didn't disappointed me. Thank you!
Positive,"Amazing game experience from start to end. Has a lot of bosses which I like, with only a couple of them that felt unfair. It's got inspiration from souls like games, but it's way more generous and not as punishing which is probably why some don't consider it to be one. Overall, solid 9 out of 10 game!"
Positive,"Looking at the recent developments in the gaming world, this is a gem I've been waiting for a very long time, and I believe many people would agree with me on this. Many of today's games should take lessons on what a game should look like. Visually, it's stunning, and I feel that some people will buy it just for the views and atmosphere alone. As for the gameplay, it's done in an enjoyable way, with mechanics that may seem overwhelming and difficult at first, but over time, you really feel like a god-killer. It's just a shame that studios like Ubisoft, with their resources, don't create something similar to this masterpiece.In summary, I consider it money well spent, and I hope I'm not the only one.I highly recommend this title, and to new players: don't give up, and good luck.(I'm quietly hoping this will be Game of the Year.)"

Positive,Black Myth: Invisible walls
Positive,"It's not quite a souls game, but it's very close. Some aspects are more like dark souls than elden ring like no map, the way travel works and those types of limitations, the style and gameplay and flow are very familiar to souls. However, the combat, leveling, etc. plays more like Jedi Survivor which is a souls game, but you're limited with weapon type and to a few different skill trees rather than like traditional classes.The reason this is much easier than souls is because you aren't punished on death (you don't lose anything), you level up very quickly, and you can restat all your skills for free whenever you want.So again, it's very fun, best visuals in a souls like game, just not as challenging as I might have hoped. Definitely worth getting though. For those who think its going to be like god of war, you may be struggling with the difficulty. For those who thinks it's a souls game, you may find it not punishing enough, but I feel they've struck a fairly good balance.I'm level 32 after 10 hours and most bosses can be beaten in 1 or 2 tries or after changing your skills up to match their weakness.I give it a 8.5/10."
Positive,"GOTY, nothing else to say."

Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is great. The combat is challenging, but not as difficult as Elden Ring or other soulslike games. If you're looking a fun ARPG with some cool action and story, this is the game for you."
Positive,Game of the Year.
Positive,so far so good
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong stands out with its captivating boss battles that truly elevate the experience. Each encounter is a unique spectacle, with bosses that boast striking designs and intricate mechanics. The variety is impressive—whether it’s facing off against towering, fire-wielding demons or elegant celestial beings wielding lightning, every fight feels distinct and challenging.The need to adapt strategies and master different tactics for each boss adds a rewarding layer to the gameplay. The rich lore connected to these enemies also enriches the narrative, making each victory feel meaningful.Visually and audibly, the boss battles are stunning. The dynamic effects and immersive sound design create a thrilling atmosphere that pulls players deep into the action. The sense of accomplishment from overcoming tough foes makes each boss fight a highlight of the game. For fans of action RPGs, Black Myth: Wukong delivers an unforgettable experience, with its bosses being a standout feature that ensures every battle is memorable and engaging."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong completely exceeded my expectations. Right from the start, the combat feels sharp and responsive, rewarding both timing and strategy. The variety of environments is staggering—each one is beautifully designed, with its own atmosphere and challenges, keeping the game feeling fresh as you move through different stages. And the boss fights? There are over 90 of them, and they aren’t just there to pad out the game. Each boss is unique and demands real attention, forcing you to adapt and perfect your approach.The skill tree is another standout feature. It’s not just there to unlock a few flashy moves—there's real depth to it. You can build your character in so many different ways, whether you want to focus on raw power, agility, or more technical skills. I loved being able to fine-tune my abilities to fit my playstyle, which made every fight feel different, even after hours of gameplay.Overall, the game kept me completely hooked. It balances challenge and reward perfectly, never feeling unfair but always pushing you to get better. If you're into action RPGs and love the feeling of mastering a complex system, Black Myth: Wukong is an experience you won't want to miss."
Positive,"Story:Nothing really that strong here when it comes to the story. You play as a monkey and look for the six parts of Sun Wukong’s spirit when it split. You don’t really know why you’re doing it, and characters don’t explain why. I’m not sure if the characters even know why. The story is as linear as it can get, but the lore is interesting. Characters pop in from time to time to give you an ability then they disappear. All linear and very straightforward. Not one of the strengths of this game.Graphics and environment:Some of the best graphics in this game. My set-up could run the game decently in High settings and it still looked great. As for the environments, this is where it gets frustrating. You can’t access places you think you can. There is no map, so you might get lost or forget what you were doing the last time before you died. Especially if you get far. I spent a lot of time just walking around in circles and trying to get in places you’re not allowed to.Gameplay:This is where the game shines the most. It excels with so many varied combos, skills and spells. If you master it, you become unstoppable and can sometimes beat bosses in the first try. The bosses are well-designed and unique. Some of them are really difficult. The customization is there, but it is limited to just after you beat some bosses. Some armor sets look great.Overall, this is a phenomenal game so far and I recommend it to anyone who likes GOW, Sekiro, Dark Souls, and any of their ilk.Ridiculously overpowered  main and optional bosses that are almost invincible with buffs in a list longer than my d*ck. F*ck this game10/10"
Positive,Will this be the game of the year 2024
Positive,game of the year 100%
Positive,the only time i like being called a monkey
Positive,black monkey elden ring
Positive,Love the fighting and challenging bosses
Positive,great game embrace monke make sure you look around
Positive,PRAISE THE CCP
Positive,game of the year SimpleFast pace
Positive,"This game is amazing, so worth it. It only gets better. GOTY contender.More like God of War than a ""soulslike"" with a variety of difficult bosses.I recommend the original Chinese VA with subtitles, it's very immersive and fits the lip sync."
Positive,"I have completed the game and seen both endings. Currently in chapter 2 of new game plus. This game is visually stunning with captivating music and animation (i have rewatch them more than 6 times now XD). The story is actually layered with meaning that requires reading the journal of each monster or listen to dialogues to understand what it really meant. If you are only rushing through the game, you will only understand the surface level interpretation and miss out on the multiple meanings each chapter is trying to convey, how it ties with the destined ones journey at the end and hints of some hidden quests. This game is truly made with love and care. For the story, it helps if you have prior knowledge of journey to the west but it is not a requirement as this is set after the journey. You just need to read each of the journal entry as you obtained them. It is arranged in a way that slowly unfolds the background story. This game requires you to pay attention to what is written and listen to dialogue for potential hints. You will be rewarded.There is no map in game and invisible walls in certain areas. After playing it, i understand the design choice. By having no map, you have to look around to get your bearing and try to explore every possible area that might be a path. The invisible wall actually help in that regard. The game is visually stunning, the last thing i want is getting lost in an open world (map gets bigger in later chapter) or artificial high walls or impossible to reach areas that would ruin the beautiful scenery. The game also rewards those who explore by discovering rare items or secret quests that makes bosses of each chapter easier to beat. Combat is also very satisfying especially after you understood the mechanics. You actually have one block spell, 2 parry methods (not including certain transformations). Rock solid is an instant block that cost mana, resolute counterflow (smash stance) that cost one focus point or offence in defense (thrust stance) that is free. Stance parry requires at least one light attack followed by heavy attack to activate, so time your parry properly. This is on top of your dodge/perfect dodge. There is also a skill whereby you can dodge once without cancelling your attack chain so you can technically attack, dodge, attack, dodge/parry and so on. I do notice some input lag for healing but not a big deal. The game allows free reset of all your skill points (at shrine) and respec your stats upgrade in chapter 2 (hidden npc) so experiment on what works best for a given boss. What you experience in the start of the chapter is but a glimpse of the full fighting potential of sun wukong. You will be working your way up as you progress. And since you don't lose your progress, you are only going to keep getting stronger.I highly recommend this game. The game does not hold your hand but gives you hints and teaches you what to expect as it prepares you for later chapters as more complex battle mechanics are introduced. It has been a satisfying experience and i can tell a lot of work has been put in this game to make it. Totally worth the full price. 9/10 for me."
Positive,baller as hell but def not a souls like
Positive,PLAY IT !
Positive,Very good yes
Positive,Kinda a banger
Positive,its the original goku but instead of him its about a monkey who takes his anger out on the gods
Positive,"Enjoyed playing. i'd rate it 8.69/10.What i liked:- Bosses were nice to fight, they all had unique style to them. - Combat was very satisfying and you felt every heavy attack.- Overall game play was a great experience.- The some of the secret areas/bosses were better than the main bosses of the chapter both visually and game play wise.- Visuals 10/10.What i disliked:- Hated invisible walls as it was annoying moving around the map.- Personally, story was bit hard to follow due to the Chinese names of the characters and the lack of character explaining/building for figures in Buddhism. You have to watch a video explaining the story to understand the lore. Can't really blame it though as it was made for a Chinese audience. - The most pain in the ass was if you wanted to 100% the game you had to grind seeds,soaks and armour which can be dropped by unique enemies or collecting plants. The item drops uses a RNG system meaning this could take several hours grinding to collect a single item.If you want a good game to play on your own this is worth it."
Positive,"monke see, monke play."
Positive,"Love the game. Its very hard but still alot of fun. I just wish i had the gourd that came with the preorder or any other gourd ive picked up along the way but hey are not there, some kind of glitch."
Positive,Absolute banger. Goku would've enjoyed.
Positive,"For many years, I used to be an assassin in France, Egypt, a warrior fighting in Greek mythology, Norse mythology, a cowboy exploring in western American. Today I finally return to my hometown to be my own hero."
Positive,"Super fun game so far and graphically stunning.  The game is paced pretty fast so you don't get bored, and the maps are pretty straightforward and mostly linear (reminds me of the maps in older games like darksiders and stuff where each part of the map is its own section that you can fully explore).  It depends on you if you like vast open worlds or something more straighforward like this.  I, for one, have had my fair share of open world so this was actually a welcome surprise (100% a game is in sight once more).  Fights are also fast paced and fun, with a similar style to dark souls albeit it arguably easier.  I'd definitely recommend getting the game so you can RETURN TO MONKE!"
Positive,"In realms where legends weave their tale, Where ancient myths and heroes sail, There stands a game, both bold and grand, A journey through a mystic land.Wukong, the Monkey King so wise, With staff in hand, he seeks the skies. In “Black Myth: Wukong,” his tale unfolds, A saga rich, with treasures untold.Through forests dense and deserts wide, With every step, a challenge tried. Bosses fierce, of daunting might, Each battle is a thrilling fight.The graphics, oh, a feast for eyes, With colors bright and vast blue skies. From lush green woods to mountains high, A visual treat, a gamer’s sigh.Combat swift, like flowing stream, With magic spells and moves supreme. A dance of blades, a clash of might, In every fight, pure delight.Yet, not without its flaws, we see, Some bugs and glitches, wild and free. But even so, the charm remains, A masterpiece, despite the strains.So here’s to Wukong, brave and true, A game that brings old myths anew. In every quest, in every fight, A legend born in pixel light"
Positive,very fun game
Positive,"Probably the best game of 2024 so far, hoping to see it in GOTY"
Positive,"This game is one of the best games I've played in at least 10 years.  In fact, it's made its way into my top 5 favorite games ever.  I love the attention to detail, the deep and rich lore steeped in Chinese mythology, and the amount of beautiful variety from start to finish.  The game itself is well-optimized and polished - very smooth experience!Excellent game.  Great introduction piece for me and this developer.  I'll be keeping my eye on their work."
Positive,"This game is amazing.It does so many things so well, it is incredibly polished in every way.The only other game with such polish I have played is Horizon Forbidden West.The combat feels great, it is all about the combat.You have very good variety of spells and skills, to approach fights differently. You can have several different 'builds' - while they are not many, the variety and difference in gameplay between them is great, so truly makes customizing and experimenting very rewarding.Even the story - I am not familiar with the novel it is based on, and I have no knowledge of Chinese mythology;I understood maybe 30% of the story/plot in this game - and even still, I found it so entertaining, so interesting.Even though I barely understood what was happening and why, I was hooked the whole time.I can only imagine how awesome this must be for people who are familiar with the novel and characters.I beat it on NG+, and still I want to play more, so I have started a second NG+ playthrough.The game is not perfect, but is damn near close to it."
Positive,very good game 10/10
Positive,Best game ever  please China more games like that <3 <3 <3
Positive,"Best game i have played soo far this year, this has to be GOTY for sure."
Positive,Monke stick goes BONK
Positive,"I love Journey to the West, and this game feels like it honors the source material while still telling their own story. This is a good game about a magical monkey sage, and if any of that sounds fun to you you'll probably enjoy this game."
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong is what is sorely missing from the games industry for the last many years.. This is a single player, not online, no store, no bs... It is basically God of War in the Chinese mythology. Fantastic! New stories and god's to enjoy, fabulous visuals and sound. Combat is very challenging, along the lines of a souls game, without such a harsh penalty for death. I am very much enjoying my journey as the monkey king, even though... I'm not actually a monkey. A game ass game! Enjoy"
Positive,monkey game good
Positive,"First levels are extremely linear, but it gets better as you advance. Boss fights are awesome, and the game is full of secrets quests. 8/10"
Positive,its very hard
Positive,reject humanity (the celestial realm) return to monke (sun wukong)
Positive,"Very interesting story with great fighting mechanics, although it takes influence from other titles obviously it makes a name for itself with unique mechanics I have never seen before. And although many people may not be readers, i recomend reading the descriptions for all the enemies as they provide interesting short stories that give exposition about the world."
Positive,1. monke2. monke get stick3. monke bonk people with stick4. gods mad at monke bonking with stick5. monke bonks gods with stick6. gods bonk monke but monke come back to life7. monke bonk gods with stick harder8. credits rollart
Positive,"This game has it all. Graphics and art-design are amazing, sound design is fantastic, very smooth combat that can be punishing at times but also rewards you as your skills develop. Skill tree has tons of variety that you can mix and match since resetting skills is free. You lose nothing upon dying so exploration is encouraged and rewarding. The story is good and the bosses are unique and intriguing. The gameplay is fluid and allows for a clean combat experience. Overall the game combines all the elements you need for an amazing single player experience and although it has some flaws I can’t recommend this game enough. For a first big release it is impressive what they were able to do and I could without a doubt see this being game of the year."
Positive,"Honestly, love this game.I have some slight performance issues when starting up the game and during some cut scenes, bt the overall game experience makes up for it. If your into some good and challenging boss fights without the fear of loosing your stuff and love fantasy games, this si a must have!"
Positive,Can you please for the love of god and the CCP fix the absolute travesty that are the hitboxes in this game. The awfulness that is the 100-Eye Daoist's hitbox is making me actively bald from stress.
Positive,first 5 minutes : monkey mad cuz the gods are racist monke dafeated cuz head hurts500 years later : new monke the new monke look cool the new monke learn fast.great monke
Positive,"Good game! Story and soundtrack pretty good, gameplay not to hard for whom never play soul-like before same like me."
Positive,I can't stress this enough.. This for ME is GOTY. 1. It's NOT a souls like 2. It's Far to fun for it's own good3. The Boss battles are memorable and the action is amazingly crunchy I small negative: The perfect dodge did not feel so 'perfect' at times where the input and the action on screen just did not match up. All n all I would pay for this game 2 times over and I honestly has an amazing time getting to learn about Chinese mythology.
Positive,Good game the combat was fun and I liked how it was more of a boss rush. I wouldn't consider it GOTY worthy but a solid game nonetheless. Since there is no action canceling it makes dodging and healing unresponsive and got really annoying. Lack of a map was also aids because I spent a lot of time back tracking or going down a path I've already been to. The game was also a bit too easy and I wish more boss fights were like Erlang in the secret ending.
Positive,"I played for 3 hours and only raged once, Very good game !!!"
Positive,awesome game 10/10
Positive,"I know this is not a souls-like game, but it felt like one to me. Black Myth: Wukong is actually my first experience with a game that has elements similar to the souls-like genre. The challenging combat, the need to learn enemy patterns, and the sense of accomplishment after each victory all made me feel like I was playing a true souls-like. I even struggled with dodging enemies, which added to the intensity and made every encounter feel like a hard-earned battle. Even though it might not be categorized as such, for someone like me who's new to this kind of difficulty, it certainly felt like a souls-like experience.Skill issue ? hehe"
Positive,"Fun, but pretty hard."
Positive,We go monke.
Positive,"Imo one of the best games i've played since a while, great RPG elements in a souls like game."
Positive,Good Job China For the First and one of the best AAA game
Positive,"Incredible game, It's got a Souls kind of feel to it when it comes down to the combat and the exploration, I will say it's not quite as open world as other games i've played but there are soooo many secrets to find in this game and it can easily have you hooked into it for 50+ - 100+ hours without any pay to win or extra content to be sold sepretely it makes this game a 10/10 for me!"
Positive,Graphics soo good that it can make your 4070 look like gt 710. Game design is well choreographed. Very Challenging!! and why the fuck it has soooo many bosses. but i love it. requires patience.
Positive,oo oo aa aa
Positive,monkey good 👍🏾
Positive,"Good game, epic boss fight and Monkey D Luffy"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is an absolute gem! The stunning visuals, fluid combat, and rich storytelling create an unforgettable experience. The game masterfully blends Chinese mythology with top-tier action, offering a thrilling journey from start to finish. Wukong's transformations and diverse abilities keep gameplay fresh, and every boss fight feels epic. The world is beautifully crafted, making every moment a visual treat. Whether you're into mythology or just love great action games, Black Myth: Wukong is a must-play. It's a true masterpiece that delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!⭐ 10/10"
Positive,i like it when monkey swings pole
Positive,"Loving it!Really liking the gameplay and the roguelike aspect when you die, it's an interesting way to approach this kind of game to keep your progress even when you die. Makes it different from others."
Positive,"I am not good at this game, but I really enjoy it. The feeling of beating a boss first time is just as good as beating a boss after a fair few attempts! Visually it is stunning as well and I haven't run into any bugs while playing. Overall great experience."
Positive,"Good game, I thought this game going to be easy, but it wasn't that easy to beat. the environment is so beautiful and bunch of unique bosses. Sometimes it confusing because of no map, but hey what kind of monkey that know how to read a map. Luckily we have travel shrine with checkpoint image to guide the player. Really enjoy the experience so far."
Positive,Love the game uhhuhh uhhh aaahhh ahhhhh
Positive,no monke no happy
Positive,"Really thought Elden Ring great, wow this game, what a masterpiece! 10/10. Music, visuals, story, and combat were sublime. I'll def come back in a month to do newgame plus."
Positive,This game is worth the hype. The pacing of the game is top notch with the right intensity of boss fights and trash mobs. Highly recommend.
Positive,"I just finished this game on PS5. The story is amazing. I also like those character designs. The main character is different from the traditional Sun Wukong story. It presents a brand new world.Of course, you can also understand that it perhaps expresses the irony in Wu Cheng'en's original story: not all gods are noble and pure, and Yaoguais (monsters) also have a human side.Remember the name - Sun Wukong. Never ""Son Goku""."
Positive,quite difficult not bad
Positive,What. A. Game. It's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen
Positive,i loved it more than elden ring with just 6 hours
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong took seven years to make, and the wait has definitely paid off. This game brings the legendary Monkey King to life with stunning graphics, smooth combat, and a story that pulls you in.The world is beautifully designed, with detailed environments and fluid animations. The combat is fun and challenging, offering a variety of abilities that keep things exciting.The story, inspired by Chinese mythology, is well-told and keeps you engaged. The voice acting adds depth to the characters, making them feel real.What makes this game stand out is the sense of adventure. Exploring the world, finding secrets, and facing off against epic bosses keeps you hooked.Overall, Black Myth: Wukong was worth the seven-year wait. It’s a must-play for action RPG fans and anyone looking for a great gaming experience."
Positive,"Great game, wish they could've made the full 13 chapters but oh well, hope they will make the other 7 chapters into a dlc."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is an action game with fundamental gameplay balancing problems but that pales in comparison to the amount, scale and sheer quality of content that it has to offer. You can so easily tell that they spent years developing this game tirelessly to deliver what is basically the biggest triple A action game ever made in history.𝗜𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗵 𝗯𝘂𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴?Now if you are only interested in the verdict, since this game has Denuvo: It is worth the money, This game boasts a grand total of 113 bosses spanning over 6 chapters of story and while of course I could trim down all the glorified elites/one-off weird gimmicks it would easily still boil down to at least 60 “real” bosses and that is absolutely incredible when you compare it with other games in the genre. I think both casual and hardcore players can find a ton of enjoyment because the game offers you a lot of ways to reduce/increase the difficulty. 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆The story is actually not a reimagined adaptation of Journey to the West but it’s an imagining of a follow-up/sequel to it, centering around the mission of resurrecting Wukong centuries after his defeat. If you are a fan of the original work, it is an absolute feast of references since throughout the campaign you’d be meeting friends and foes that Wukong encountered during his original journey. 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝘀I wouldn’t say the “dark” tone of the game doesn’t match the vibe of the original myth because as per usual with Asian myths they are very edgy anyway but I would have loved if the game was more vibrant in visuals. One of my first complaints in my first impressions was that the art direction is lacking and I still feel like this is somewhat true by the end of the game, for the environment at least. The world looks too realistic for its own good most of the time, creating really bland landscapes that only really captivate the eyes thanks to UE5’s graphical fidelity. This disappointment in art direction only extends to environmental design however, as the game’s incredibly diverse array of enemies absolutely do not disappoint. When I played Lies of P last year, it kind of pushed the boundary for enemy variety for this kind of games, but Wukong probably does it even better. There are monsters from every kind of abomination category imaginable, each with their own lore, and the designs on both the bosses and the enemies are absolutely top notch, showcasing both the core features from their original myth while also animated super well. The insect enemies in particular are absolute disgusting and this is to the game’s benefits, the effort they spend on animating the wiggling limbs to create the arachnid feeling makes them phenomenally terrifying. I genuinely think people who have actual arachnophobia will get panic attacks playing Chapter 4, a testament to how good the choreography and animation are.𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻Level design, however, is an aspect that can sour the experience sometimes. The game is too obsessed with trying to make complicated levels it just ends up being confusing, because once you have taken a branching path, it is incredibly difficult to find your bearings back to where you were without being constantly paranoid and check corners every 5 seconds. This is similar to Team Ninja games where there is a deliberate effort to make the levels not boring straight hallways but it ends up making the exploration annoying because there are too many paths to take at once. Good level design is when they do this and intentionally lead the players back to where they were but is it seldom seen in this game, where more often than not, dead ends await you. That being said, I think the only part of the game that’s severely affected by this is Chapter 3 with the prison and snow area, for the others it is way less egregious due to the breakneck pacing of constant boss fights.𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗯𝗮𝘁Now I have to talk about the game’s fundamental balancing issue that I mentioned at the beginning and also boss fights at the same time. I LOVE the bosses in this game (the “real” ones that is, not some random cart that breathes fire), there is an insurmountable amount of effort put into designing the movesets with a lot nuances/switch-ups to keep you on your toes. The variety of attacks is worth mentioning especially, on par with something like the recently released Elden Ring DLC. The boss quality keeps ramping up towards the later half of the game too, like don’t get me wrong there are still many stinkers here and there but there are so many memorable ones.Then what is the balancing issue? This game’s difficulty is all over the place. You are given a set of tools to assist with combat but most of them feel like cheat, which, don’t get me wrong, fit Wukong perfectly as the mischievous warrior but does it dumb down the game so much if you actually make use of them. There are just so many ways in this game you can make the bosses stagger and I’m for sure not a big fan of it, this is also one of the main reasons why a lot of people don’t consider this game a Souls-like because the difficulty certainly isn’t up to par. But then we also have bosses that are actually balanced around all these tools with their narrow windows of punishing and they feel extremely good to fight since you don’t have to hold back, which makes me wish that the rest of the game was balanced in the same manner. I have to intentionally hold back most of the time in order to make the bosses threatening and this is not something you want players to feel, I just want to be able to do all the cool shit without feel like I’m breaking the game in half. That being said, I am 100% doing a playthrough that excludes all magic and I think it would be both drastically different and also much more fun. ---------------------------------------------------Regardless of all that this game is just so. fucking. cool. Unfathomably badass, not in the silly wacky DMC way but it just makes you feel good. Attacking, parrying and dodging all feel super satisfying. There are so many satisfying secrets to find, with each chapter having its own Souls DLC-esque optional area. Bosses will have a variety of voice lines than react to what you do and numerous special interactions with certain items that reward lore-attentive players. The cinematic setpieces are unapologetically badass without being intrusive to gameplay. Even though the storytelling didn’t get me at first it gets a lot better after the first chapter and it’s like the perfect mix between the cryptic background lore-heavy element of Souls games and the usual cinematic kind of story. There’s an animated shorts at the end of every chapter with each of them having a different animation style and they all were awesome.As an all-round product this is easily the best contender for Game of the Year this year and I can’t imagine anything topping it. Absolutely amazing game. First impressions weren’t too kind but as the game got more expansive and I got used to the gameplay while learning how to restrict myself to have fun, I ended up having such a blast."
Positive,"They even created a separate animation and theme song for each chapter, while other game's art shit needs extra pay. May be parts of this game are immature, but it's apparently they really superlative everything they can.WUKONG lets me experience a higher level of content, a true ninth category of art. Sadly, in recent years most games are just commodities, they are no taste."
Positive,"Beautiful graphics, interesting combat mechanics, fantastic story/lore. Just a solid good game."
Positive,"From fights to animations, this game is perfect in its own way!!!"
Positive,Massive amazing world
Positive,Phenomenal game 9.6/10 only cause there isn't an in game map
Positive,"Some major monkeying takes place in this game. This shit will make you lose your bananas. It's an ape-solute blast. One of the most a-peeling game of the year. A chimply marvelous game. Boot it up, crack open a cold one, and be orangu-tained. It's simian to other action RPGs, but still manages to stand out on it's own. Play this game while it's still in it's prime-ate. It's more fun than a barrell full of monkeys. You've got to gibbon this game a chance."
Positive,"This game is 100% worth your time if you love Soulsborne games. It actually feels a bit like a more refined Bloodborne when it comes to many of the boss fights. I LOVE soulesborne games, but for whatever reason, Sekiro never clicked with me. This game clicks, and it clicks harder than a 14 year old closing out browser tabs when someone 'forgets' to knock."
Positive,"Excellent game, highly recommend.  Had a great time with it but definitely makes you dig deep at certain parts.  It's not easy."
Positive,God of war x souls the perfect balance. GOTY
Positive,"""Tell me, is my kind destined for extermination?"" mmm, im monkee *beats to death with staff*"
Positive,"In addition to being fun, it made all the right people upset! Reminder that DEI ""consulting"" companies and game journos basically have a racket wherein the journos get kickbacks from DEI ""consulting"" companies when they successfully milk a dev for money to censor a game, and the journos attack and instigate review bombing games/devs/studios who won't play ball. ""That's a nice game you have there, it'd be a shame if something happened to it..."" The oldest trick in the book. Reject them at every opportunity."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a visual spectacle, with stunning graphics and intricate details in both character design and environments. From the finely crafted clothing to the richly textured backgrounds, every frame looks like a piece of art. However, this visual fidelity does come with performance challenges; many players have reported struggling to run the game smoothly. I experienced a few minor frame stutters, but these cleared up after updating my graphics driver. Nonetheless, it's something prospective players should keep in mind. On a positive note, the option to skip every cutscene is a welcome feature, allowing the game’s pace to remain brisk and player-focused.However, the game’s attention to environmental detail has a downside. The world often feels overly busy, making navigation difficult. This is especially true in larger, open areas where it’s easy to get lost without clear landmarks. Invisible walls also impede exploration, frequently blocking areas that appear accessible, which can feel frustrating and disrupt immersion. The lack of verticality compounds these issues; ranged enemies perched above are tough to reach, requiring players to hunt for the specific path that allows access. Additionally, enemies sometimes fall through these invisible barriers, breaking immersion and forcing players to awkwardly pursue them. There’s also a lot of straightforward running between content, and backtracking to old areas for quests or items quickly becomes a repetitive chore.Combat in Black Myth: Wukong is both rewarding and frustrating. The core combat revolves around light attack combo strings with up to five hits, but long attack animations can leave players vulnerable, locking them into place. Dodging is the primary defensive option, but it must be timed after attack animations, making it challenging to avoid incoming damage. Heavy attacks, unlocked through a Focus meter, deal significant damage but can be difficult to land, especially against larger enemies. The targeting system often locks onto specific parts of a boss, making it easy to miss fully charged attacks, especially as enemies grow in size. A secondary resource, Qi, allows players to replicate powerful attacks from defeated bosses, adding variety and utility, particularly for applying status effects.Magic is another major component of combat, with spells offering powerful but limited-use abilities. Spells have long cooldowns and consume mana, which cannot be replenished during fights, making each cast a strategic decision. They range from freezing enemies to setting up attacks, to transforming into unique characters with their own movesets. The most interesting is a spell that creates clones of the player, adding layers of chaos and opportunity in battle. As the game progresses, these magical abilities expand significantly, offering players more creative ways to approach combat.The gear system in Black Myth: Wukong is one of the game’s strengths, providing engaging choices that affect playstyle. Resources for crafting are automatically collected from defeated enemies, allowing players to continuously upgrade to new gear sets that feature unique thematic bonuses. Armor sets aren’t just about increasing stats; each piece offers situational perks that encourage experimentation, such as increased power when near water or bonus damage after sprinting. These bonuses help keep the gameplay dynamic and allow players to tailor their approach to different encounters.Customization extends beyond gear, with an extensive skill system that lets players modify nearly every aspect of their abilities. Skill points can be invested to alter spells, attacks, and defensive moves, and can be reset at any rest point, encouraging players to experiment freely. Additionally, the game’s non-linear progression lets players explore different paths, offering an alternative if a specific boss proves too challenging. This flexibility helps mitigate frustration, especially with the sheer number of bosses—over 80—spread throughout the game.However, there are notable design missteps, particularly in later chapters. Many chapter bosses are exceedingly difficult unless players find secret quests that provide game-changing items. These secrets are often so well-hidden that guides are practically necessary, which can alienate those who miss them. From Chapter 5 onward, the game’s encounters start to feel repetitive, with several bosses sharing similar, limited movesets, creating a sense of padding. Paired boss fights lack the excitement of earlier one-on-one encounters, and Chapter 6’s vast, empty spaces feel more like a scavenger hunt than meaningful exploration. One particularly tedious boss in Chapter 6 requires the player to hold an activation button, with unclear prompts on where to stand, making the fight feel more like a chore than a challenge.The final boss is a particular low point, feeling disproportionately difficult compared to anything that precedes it. This encounter is plagued by excessive evasiveness, drawn-out combos, and unskippable mid-fight cutscenes that drag down the pacing. Invisible walls around the arena further complicate dodging, making it an infuriating test of patience rather than skill. The difficulty spike feels unfair, and I suspect many players may quit the game out of frustration rather than push through to the end.Overall, Black Myth: Wukong offers a visually stunning world and deep combat mechanics that reward exploration and experimentation. However, inconsistent design choices, performance issues, and frustrating moments—particularly in the later stages—hinder the overall experience. It's a game that shows immense promise but stumbles in its execution, especially for those unprepared for its sudden shifts in difficulty and pacing."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is by all appearances better than it has any right to be for the first foray of a studio into the AAA action genre.  It plays a bit like God of War, with a few Souls systems, but more the former than the later.  At least early on there is a heavy focus on fighting bosses in quick succession, with only a token amount of enemies in between.  This is the turn off for me personally, I find grinding on difficult bosses one after another quite tiresome - I prefer the parts in between.  Not sure I'll play much more of this one, but make no mistake - this is a well polished, beautiful, seemingly AAA-grade game set in a Chinese mythology.  That's not something you see every day."
Positive,"Great game. It exceeded my expectations; I didn't expect it to be bad, but we've been burned so many times by incredible tech demos which disappoint, that I was skeptical. This game has incredible combat, a good story and fantastic graphics. With that being said, I have 2 minor grievances about the game; the sometimes unreliable camera and various invisible walls, which could be hidden a bit better. All things considered, Black Myth Wukong is a must play. It's a solid 9/10."
Positive,"This game is pretty damn awesome. The boss fights are challenging but once you finally beat them you feel like you're on top of the world. The world is beautiful and vivid. The fighting mechanics feel great and are easy to learn. And the characters are charming and very expressive. Even though I am nowhere near the end just yet, I'm having a blast so far. I really want to see this game to the end and that's what I plan to do. The game is an amazing experience for people that like ARPGs. Trust me, you won't be disappointed with this title."
Positive,"I just Finish the Finall Boss, and i have to say the game was amazing in every single part. So if you like story mode games its tottaly worth playing it"
Positive,"Good game, just hate the invisible walls, it's frustrating."
Positive,"Game of the Year.  Visuals, Music, Story so far (not done yet), Character, everything is just Wow. Totally recommended"
Positive,100% achivements completed after 69h - everyone who started or is on the jorney - GL brothers and sisters Game is 10/10 - it just crushed my expectation and iam rly happy for time spend in this game
Positive,GOOD MONKEY HITTING HARD
Positive,The beauty of a destined one.
Positive,"Love it, Wukong is one of my favorite mythical stories and inspired Dragon Ball which is literally my childhood, so being able to play a story driven by those myths and creatures are awesome for me personally, my pc is a 4 years old OMEN but it handles it well with some tweaking to the settings, if your pc is struggling , NexusMods has a few improvements that could help you out :) just go to google and type black myth wukong nexus mods. Hope that helps."
Positive,"This game is incredible and is definitely WORTH A TRY!I rarely rate games, and I am usually not into these types of games due to the commitment needed in the story line, I am a P2P competitive CS2 enthusiast.I was instantly sucked into the story line and a week later, I find myself playing through the story line again and enjoying the game even more.If you see this game, please give it a try, you won't regret it"
Positive,"Recommended to anyone who's looking for an immersive experience, amazing story line, visually stunning graphics and challenging boss fights. You'll easily get lost in the landscapes while exploring and searching every nook and cranny trying to find the next hidden treasure or boss. I love the small meditation spots the game make you search for, I take these moments to actually stop in real life and actually focus on my breath and well being before jumping into the next intense boss fight. Not the mention the amazing soundtrack as the cherry on top.15/10 would get lost in this stunning masterpiece."
Positive,waiter waiter one peak please!
Positive,Easily the best game of the year

Positive,"I was looking forward to this game ever since I saw the trailer during last year's game awards. After finishing the game, its safe to say I loved this game as an overall experience. I have few gripes with games but I'll list them out later.The Good:- The visuals are stunning and artstyle is gorgeous- The boss designs are great. Frog boss is reused quite a few times but that's the only repeated/reskinned boss I can think of so it's not too much of an annoyance.- Exploration felt weak in chapter 1 but it quickly got so much better from chapter 2.- Frame stutters were not present for majority of MY playthrough which was good.- It is not as boss rush-ish as some reviews made it out to be. It has quite a lot of bosses but most of them are mini bosses with weak health pools (or maybe my weapn was overleveled for each boss). - Majority of the bosses (I'd estimate close to 90%) are easy, which is a good thing to attract more players that are not really into single difficulty games.  Most bosses were sub 5 tries. Only boss that took me the longest was Yellow Loong where I was stuck for hours. The next boss that took me the longest was yellow wind sage that took about 40 minute worth of attempts.- Build variety is decent. You can pair different skills, stances and weapons to get the most damage output or stunlock the enemies to death.- Spells and Transformations: the spells are great and few transformations are great too. The additional health bar some transformations provide is amazing in clutch situations. You can use it to defeat a boss or get back into your dodging rhythm without worrying about dying under panic.- Some boss fights have save points. So if you die, it starts at certain point in the fight without having to go through everything. Also such fights start the portion after the save point with full flask and full mana (mainly ch5 and 6 ending boss fights).- The end boss fight is spic and totally worth the whole journey.The Bad:- Boss combos: some bosses have some insane combo extenders when they reach about 30% hp. Mainly bosses like Yellow Loong, Supreme Inspector in final chapter, Emerald Armed Mantis have some long combos with 8 or more moves back to back with different dodge timings. Only saving grace to this is that they extend moves from phase 1 and prolong them with more moves.- Feints: some moves have similar start animation as other attacks in their arsenal but different attack hitboxes. They feint you into dodging by doing the same animation as some other move but has a follow up that acts as a hitbox instead. I think they overused this in long combos.- Hitboxes: the hitboxes on some enemies are iffy at times (totally not pointing to hundred eyed daoist master). Sometimes enemies hit you when they shouldn't, they miss you when they shouldn't, you miss the attack when you shouldn't etc.- Spells: sometimes the spells don't work (mainly the immobilize spell) if the enemy is doing a certain attack. Fortunately the mana doesn't get consumed at times which is good imo.- Charged attacks: you get staggered out of charged attack but you still lose your focus points. They should make it something like lies of p where if you are using 3 or 4 focus points, you can't be staggered out of charged attack execution (they can make you take damage however).- Map: although its a minor complaint, but it would be nice to have a map. I have missed few questlines/achievements coz I didn't explore all the branches I came across. Chapter 6 suffers from lack of map imo.Overall I had a blast with this game. Most of the the negatives can be fixed easily (like the hitboxes, getting staggered out of charged attack, map etc.). I hope they release more exciting games in the future."
Positive,WHY DO MUSHROOMS NEED TO TURN INTO PEOPLE
Positive,Game of the Year!!!
Positive,An exquisite master piece in modern media.... Wukong >>> Kratos
Positive,cant go super sayan
Positive,I had a friend named Vinny and he said all hard games are souls like. So I guess its souls like. I do recommend this game
Positive,MONKE  + no DEI/SBI
Positive,"First a warning: If you are uncomfortable with interfering with your CPU clock or other shenanigans you might run into some insurmountable issues on boot-up.So there is this claim that mainly intel-CPU's of the 13th & 14th generation are causing the game to crash on boot-up. More specifically: during shader compilation. My CPU is 11th generation but the game still crashed. Only after I installed the latest drivers from intel directly AND under-clocked my CPU for the first shader compilation, I could get the game running. It even runs on default CPU-usage now. Another warning: The Game is a graphical Powerhouse! It will force your System to it's limits. I do not have the hardware to make it look as gorgeous as it could be, but to me it has always been gameplay over graphics. It sure doesn't hurt if a game looks as insanly good as this one. Don't be fooled by the looks, the only souls-like-elements I could find are: The respawn / healing mechanics on shrines. Enemies respawn if you do. There is no Parry, only Dodge and basically every action consumes stamina. But that are all the comparisons you can make. The stakes are much lower, as you don't loose much progress on death. Therefore it's not as much of a punishment to just throw yourself against the many... many... many, many Bosses and Mini-Bosses. And don't be fooled twice: This Game is far from easy! Very linear with few alternate paths which usually end up in a bss-arena. Overall: Solid, challenging Gameplay with an absoloute breathtaking presentation.Game of the Year potential."
Positive,THERE ARE TOO MANY WAYS TO DIE IN THE EAST...........!!!!!
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is the kind of game that comes once in a generation revolutionizing the industry. The fidelity and effects powered by UE5 are breathtaking. The developers have clearly poured their hearts into creating this magnificent piece of art. The influence it created around Sun Wukong and Chinese mythology is insane. This isn’t just a boss rush game as some have claimed. Instead it plays like a sweet child of God of War (2018) and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (2019) in a unique way. I played for 70 hours straight for a week and there wasn’t a single dull moment. The animated cutscenes at the end of each chapter, the story, the combat, the exploration, the rewards, the atmosphere and the boss designs were all so good making this experience etched to my heart. It even inspired me to start reading Journey to the West while playing. 10/10 - Potential Game of the year 2024"
Positive,"THIS GAME RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!7 STARS!!!I'm calling it now... ""GAME OF THE YEAR"" ,""DECADE"", ""CENTURY"" even!"
Positive,I thought this was Donkey Kong 64needs more bananas
Positive,"Amazing game! It has an amazing main story and side quests. The mechanic of the game/fighting/moving is great and it a nice character build tree. However, it requires a lot of resources and great graffic. So, if you don't have a good gaming PC/Laptop be ready to suffer with performance issues. Highly recommended"
Positive,"Reject Humanity, embrace monkey"
Positive,"Great game, been waiting for a long time and it surpassed my expectations."
Positive,"Finally a proper wukong game, i member playing monkeyyyyyy magic on ps 1 and that game is so good. But now growing up watching tv series of journey of the west and this game came out. Holy moly this game looks fucking good. Combat is decent i guess as you dont have light atk combination from different stances. And the boss is easy so if anyone looking for challenge is gonna be disappointed but it is still a fun game regardless. Music is really good but sometimes while exploring it stop not even ambient sound, i guess they try to emulate real exploration but for me it makes it feel lonely. Oh and finding new areas (secret) is pain in the ass, and npc quest is following a soulslike formula which is not a good thing for a game like this. Lastly the story telling a god like in this especially end of chapter animation. I really hope they make full animation style like that for full journey to the west someday. LAST one i swear i wish you can keep the wukong stance in NG+ but no, but i REALLY hope if they make sequel or prequel for wukong story they make it possible as its the fucking best moveset in the entire game that WUKONG boss is really cool looking WHY not make it playable MANNNNNNNNNN"
Positive,Reject W.O.K.E. Embrace M.O.NK.E
Positive,"After having finished 3 playthroughs, I wanted to share some of my thoughts with You :)Black Myth: Wukong is certainly not a soulslike, if thats what you are looking for. It's more like a story oriented ARPG. It might have some challenging fights, but that isn't the majority. I'd like to start with the ones, that I can't really decide on whether it's a pro or a con.(even though it isn't a soulslike, I might use soulsgames as a comparison every now and then, because the combat feels similar)Unique fightsThere is a decent variety of enemies in the game. You rarely encounter the same enemy type in different chapters of the game. The fight designs were quite appealing to me, but I can understand how some could be infuriating for a few, because they will dodge your attacks or they will prove difficult to hit.Camera & lock onI will say, that the lock on is DEFINITELY better than most of the enormous enemy encounters in FromSoft games where the camera goes really spastic. The game tries to keep the focus on at least the enemy's body, so you'd be able to tell whats up next. On some occasions unfortunately due to the nature of the enemies / their size or shape even if you are locked on you can miss your big hitting heavy attacks or even just the light ones and it can cause some frustration.Cinematography ~ The whole game is beautiful and it's designed to have cool looking fights. The end chapter cinematics are REALLY good.Combat system ~ I personally really liked the variety of combos / abilities you can pull off and succeed withProgression ~ Improving your character (gear, stats, etc.) feels great. You can definitely tell the difference.Lots of boss fights ~ This is mainly personal preference, I can see it as a hindrance for some, but I really enjoyed it.Build variety ~ There are tons of possibilities to choose from.NPC quests ~ Unlike many soulsgames, you can do all of these in a single playthrough.Length of the game ~ This isn't usually a point people make, but I feel like nowadays it's important to mention the length of a game, since we've seen many games recently, that barely even have any replayability and they might even be priced higher than a Triple A.No map ~ After having all chapters thoroughly explored I didn't have much of an issue with this, but for many, that just pick the game up some of the chapters can surely feel overwhelming to explore every cranny of.Secrets ~ There are many secrets throughout the chapters of which I feel like some are so crucial for the story they should be telegraphed better.Drop based items ~ This is always going to be a negative for me. Took me ages to 100% the game, cuz I got unlucky with RNG.Hitboxes ~ Some of the bigger bosses have you lock on to their head or chest and it can easily result in some of your hits missing, that can be quite frustrating.I feel like this is a well-rounded game with good story telling and not an overwhelming amount, but still some exploration to do. I certainly liked playing around with the different builds / abilities I was provided with. I really enjoyed my time spent with this game and I would highly recommend You try it too."
Positive,elaborate enough for a monkey game i guess...

Positive,God of War + Nioh 2 = Black Myth: Wukong 10/10 Masterpiece Just go buy it already
Positive,"Very good game, but the invisible walls will make you disappointed."
Positive,8.5~9.5 / 10-----------------------------------------------------------------96 hours NG+ 100%Don't waste your time reading other people's reviews; just go and embrace the monkey.
Positive,Chapter 1 :  Good so far.Chapter 2 :  Still good.Chapter 3 :  It's get better. Chapter 4 :  It's get even better. Deep into the game I have more build to choose. so many unique bosses. story is good.Chapter 5 : it's good.Chapter 6 : start... very weak.
Positive,"I like the game. Controls not as tight as in GOW. Presentation beyond anything I have seen so far. Just looks fantastic. Love the story. You really have to take time to explore the areas, otherwise you miss a lot of stuff and items. Pretty hard especially at the beginning.Playing on the Steamdeck on medium settings @ 30fps"
Positive,Just play it and you'll know!!
Positive,An absolute gem that surprise us all! It great to see China really invest and step up in their gaming and entertainment department. MUST BUY!!!
Positive,Its good lol
Positive,"Love it, it has great story, great combats, great characters! I only wish my computer can match its visual quality..."
Positive,"As a lifelong fan of Chinese takeout, I thought I knew everything about the culture. But after playing Black Myth: Wukong, I realized there's more to it than just sweet and sour chicken. Turns out, the Monkey King doesn't deliver food—he delivers pain. The combat is fluid, the story is captivating, and every boss fight feels unique."
Positive,"This game has been the first of its style for me not just in the fast paced fights and adaptability on each boss, playing this game made me realize just how much I can push my instincts to evolve in a fighting based game the pleasure of pulling off chain quick dodges in a row simply cannot be described in words, the environment is stunningly beautiful, the lore, the voice acting (I speak for the Chinese VA's) then the models, the animation is just next level something I did not expect at all, it is also carrying forward the story from Journey to the west sometime after the Celestial Palace conflict with the Jade Emperor and Erlang Shen, the intro well that is crazy and the final fights are even crazier, my favorite characters some of which are Xu Dog, Headless Monk (this guy is a vibe), Chen Loong (God I love your dialogue of do check back with me from time to time) have just the right personalities and the voice acting which is just perfect, some points where they can improve upon is the healing gourd responsiveness and the camera lock in some crazy fights with bigger size enemies other than this I just have admiration for what they have achieved cannot wait for the DLC and whats next from these devs and studio, I have spent about 3 hours reading all the lore, descriptions which make it feel more alive, I hope someday I or someone makes a game like this on Bharatiya Culture and I feel that day is not far so thank you for putting everything you could and more for achieving this masterpiece."
Positive,"Wukong is absolutely worth the price but nothing more. The game feels like it has many new chefs with great potential trying to bake a pie that came out quite tasty and no amount of oven time will make it better. The game has many great core ideas but the lack of experience hinders it. I also have not finished the entire game yet, so below is just what I've experienced so far. It runs great on my 3060. Outside of 2 crashes in 25 hours, it runs smooth with near zero stutters. Visually, it looks amazing, but there are some visual bugs here and there that look clearly awkward. The art direction is great, many enemies, bosses, characters look unique and visually striking. Environments are the highlight. They have a real ""mystical"" feel to it, like a bigger godly force is actively changing this world. It oozes style and the devs did an amazing job bringing the world into something coherent. The cutscenes look insanely good, its basically Sony first party levels, at times it looks even better. Though visually it never really hits the ""peak"" on an overall standpoint. It is no match against recent beautiful games like elden, ghost of tsushima, etc (wukong had lower budget anyway), but it does look better than many. With more experience, I'm sure GameScience's next game will look even better. The music is great and sets the tone of each scenario very well. The game is sort of a mix, it has god of war style loot and combat but much more aggressive, fast paced and precise, mixed with a ton of souls aspects as dressing for everything else.The game has a very good foundation for combat. You build up a meter with light attacks to perform strong heavy attacks and the upgrade tree will change up your combos and styles of heavy attacks depending on what stance you use. The attacks do feel like a punch and it rewards aggression. Dodging well rather than spamming dodge rewards you with various advantages that can be upgraded. The different spells add more depth and its up to you to figure out how to incorporate attacks with them. The animations are done well to convey how hard something hits. It is very fun to learn. Unfortunately, its not very fun to master. You quickly realise many upgrades are quite niche or utter rubbish, like spending a level up point to add a fat 1% crit chance for a max of 5% on the skill tree. Its as if the whole game was initially designed around the starting playstyle/stance, and then they had to tack on rather useless or unfun upgrades for the sake of progression. You can mix up your stances to maximise effectiveness but the ones you unlock later are more niche, great for specific attacks but youll rely on your first stance 90% of the time because it is simpler yet still very effective. This makes levelling up pretty unexciting the further you go. Enemies and bosses  The enemies in general are pretty fun. Mobs and the elite ones are very easy in the beginning but does get a bit harder toward the end. Enemy variety is quite high, many of them have unique attacks. It makes fighting them more interesting when you first meet them. Their movesets arent basic boring stuff and can be quite varied. Bosses in Wukong are an interesting case. The notable bosses are fun to fight. The attacks are lengthy, fun to learn and are extremely flashy. A lot of these bosses also have cool phase transitions. However, many of them also have some unfun gimmick or aspect to them somewhere. For example, mid-way through chapter 3, you get a boss just large enough that you have to go underneath to attack but will just block your entire camera at times during lock on so you cannot see anything unless you lock-off and rotate manually. Adding to that are the wonky hitboxes of some bosses and at times becomes a guessing game for how big their hitbox is. Fun movresets, not so fun some things. Map and Exploration  The map and loot system is sort of alright. Not exactly exciting to unlock new equipment or find new materials but it gets the job done. Exploration is not really that fun considering the unexciting or sometimes useless loot but its just worthwhile enough to find cool side bosses to fight. The dev's inexperience probably shows here the most, Theres a good number of empty swathes of land, invisible walls or paths that lead to pointlessness. The game is quite linear, so its not too egregious. But on some chapters, the map opens up more and it becomes more of a bland very minor open world. You dont explore because you want to, you explore because itll make your life easier finding the unexciting loot. Only the bosses are worth any exploration. Honestly, it was not very interesting to me so I did not really try to dig into it much nor will try to here. Its not some elaborate emotional drama, theres some lore here and there. Theres some substance to it, it does its job.  Its fun, one of the best games this year, but heavily flawed in parts that can only be remedied by experience among the devs. My favourite parts were visuals, atmosphere, and the very core of the combat system (not any of the upgrades or sidegrades). These aspects alone are done well enough that it warrants the price tag. Yet it costs nothing more because it does not do anything extraordinary and has some glaring flaws that were probably unavoidable due to the dev's first time at a proper non-mobile game. I probably sounded quite negative in my review but I really did enjoy the game for what it is and issues like those should be highlighted. Get it if youve exhausted the ""best games of each year"" list and looking for something thats worthwhile but not a core-memory achieved experience. (But its likely already a core-memory anyway since this game has gotten so much attention)Will definitely look forward to Gamescience's next game. 8/10"
Positive,First off — I grew up watching Journey to the West on repeat. SUN WUKONG IS MY HERO. Ok review time: This game is beautiful. I didn't play too much of it yet and I like the cutscenes so far. I am a bit disappointed at not being able to climb up everything; I love climbing or doing jump puzzles in games. I'll add more to my review once I put in a few more hours to this game. I'm just really excited about Monkey King lore :)
Positive,"Amazing game, super quality presentation, fun gameplay, good pacing. Some sections and boss mechanics are annoying but the player has a lot of tools to problem solve. Super cool animations were great rewards for story progression and RPG progression was a great reward for gameplay. Big. Monkey. Game."
Positive,imagine the bible if it was awesome
Positive,1 act 1000 bosses
Positive,"A beautiful game with stunning visuals and unique boss designs, however I do feel there could be some improvements with combat such as a blocking mechanic etc though this is only minor and i'm loving the game!"
Positive,"Nice game, good experience.The visual is very pretty and gameplay is charming, The map focuses on linear aspect with help of invisible wall forcing you on a path, but that doesn't kill the fun. Loving it so far.Would Recommend, worth the buy."
Positive,"It's like I have 100 good things to say and 99 bad. That is still 100 good things, but still 99 bad. The environments, cinematics, and overall presentation of the game are outstanding, and almost make up for the shallow combat, broken/bs boss mechanics, and dreadful exploration. That said, the combat is still fun, the boss fights are still epic, and the levels are still beautiful, there's just a lot of bad things about them too. The voice acting, story, and overall message are great, but super difficult to follow if you haven't read JTTW/watched the cartoon as a kid. Spirits/transformations are cool but most are seldom useful. Upgrade system exists. The graphics are beautiful, but need to be configured properly and the optimization is poor.All of that said, the game is filled with content - including optional and secret content that did not get cut and made into DLC like many other games would. Major props for that. It feels like a FINISHED game (except for technical issues).For all of my complaints, I still played the game and almost finished a NG+ at the time of review. So take that as you will."
Positive,"Just an amazing game - highly recommend to everyone. As the likes of IGN and other useless game journo's go woke & go broke, rest assured that somewhere out there, people are still making great games worthy of your money."

Positive,definitivamente é um jogo
Positive,Monke with stick 10/10
Positive,"10/10 game will play again when memory no longer holds pretty much everything that happened, it's just a shame that the game had no coop and likes to crash every 10-15 minutes on the 7900 XTX even with the latest gaymd ""fix"" and all the other black magic rituals I had to perform to make it run longer than 5 minutes at a time. In monke we trust."
Positive,"I just finished the game and holy it's peak easily 10/10.The gameplay is so good, and the soundtrack are some what good.World design is just so beautiful and easily the best I've ever seen.Bosses were avg at the first two acts but my GOD after that the game get so much betterThe acts designs are so complicated but they have a lot of good visuals.The final boss was just the BEST. But Red Boy steals the show.It should be the GAME OF THE YEAR"
Positive,"My rating for this game is 9/10.A great fun game but it has some flaws that can't be ignored.The great part: The monster and environment design are astonishing, one of the best designs in all video games.Very fun gameplay, punchy combat.Amazing voice acting, nice cutscenes.One of the best graphics in the market.The flaws:No minimaps, it’s very confusing to explore the map.No objective mark, not even the text describing the current objective, causing more confuse.Storytelling is confusing too, even for people who know Journey To The West, something you don’t know who’s who, and why do you do this.Nonetheless, this is a great game. It took me 63 hours to unlock all achievements, it’s very enjoyable 63 hours. And as a Chinese person, this is the first AAA Chinese video game, I am very happy for its success. This is a milestone for Chinese video games, awesome!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------我对这个游戏的打分：9/10分虽然是个很优秀的游戏但还没有达到完美。优点如怪物和场景设计简直神作，战斗和游戏性很耐玩，而且有着是市面上最好的画面之一。配音和动作捕捉都是顶级水平，过场动画，尤其是章节结尾的动画做的太棒了。但同时也有缺点：确实任务引导，没有地图，导致经常找不到路，搞的玩家很迷惑。故事叙事有待加强，经常感觉不明所以，主角没有任何性格，白板一块，有点无聊。不论怎么说，游戏依然是杰作，我用了63小时才解锁了全成就，游戏内容非常丰富，游戏长度值得票价。而且这是中国的第一款3A游戏，为本作的成功也感到高兴，希望以后能玩到更多优秀的中国3A游戏。"
Positive,Great game if you like fighting tons of unique bosses. The story is a bit hard to follow without being familiar with the source material but it's still self-contained enough to get a handle on it by the end. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to people who aren't put off by challenging games that don't hold your hand.
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong follows the story of the 'Destined One' a humonoid monkey that tries to follow in the steps of Wukong the Monkey King and main character in the Literary Novel 'The Journey to the West'. We encounter new characters, old characters from the novel and build a story of our own. First the bad - The game has been highly and subtly attacked in articles written online for various reasons. One reason is 'lack of diversity' specifically to there not being enough female characters. This is a flat out lie, there are way more than enough staring female character roles that show up continuously about half way through the game. Some even directly affect the destined ones quest and story. So to say there is 'lack of female diversity' is a flat out lie. Second - there are accusations against the Devs for ""Misogyny"" through quoted tweets online. These have largely been disproven and are slang sayings in Chinese society.. It be like me saying ""F*** me sideways"" over in China someone would think 'Why does this guy want someone to have sexual relations with him sideways?' When in reality it means I am having bad luck and expressing my discontent.. Same thing. The authors of these articles are grossly misrepresenting the developers for no other reason than to try and drag the game down.Now that, that is out of the way. The game itself.While yes this game is fairly linear, I don't think every game needs to be open world. What matters most to a lot of gamers, I'd say, is the story and content of the game to keep you immersed. BOY, does WUKONG have a TON of this. The game interictally takes you on your own journey to the west and uses multiple forms of media to convey the story From in game model animations, to Claymation, to anime shorts! Interactive artistic scrolls to find out more about the story you experienced. The game captivates you right away with its unique and artistically done story telling. The combat itself is very fluid and natural and fits well with the game play, you're meant to dodge and fight your way through the over 80 different uniquely designed boss fights and mobs. The combat can seem repetitive in the beginning when you don't have many things unlocked, but quickly snowballs into a plethora of skill trees and options to tailor your strategy for every boss fight. The best part is, this is a game that practically ANYONE can get involved with, whether you're a veteran single player adventure enthusiast or a newbie trying a game like this for the first time. The game gives you challenging boss fights with numerous ways to tailor your skills to fight them and even allows you to reset and redistribute your skills free of charge and no cost. So you can REALLY explore all the options there are to beating bosses.The visuals and graphics in the game are absolutely stunning, to the uniquely detailed bosses and characters brimming with detail and vitality to the various landscapes; sloping hills, dark forests, deserts, snow capped mountains. You will find yourself stopping from time to time to enjoy the various environments that you come across.Overall the game plays fantastic with little to no issues, I've only encountered frame drops at loading stages for new areas or chapters and they last 5 seconds at best.. and I have yet to encounter any major visual bugs or AI MOB issues. It plays great, the story is fantastic and the visuals to go with it are top notch. This is a game you should experience for yourself if you enjoy fantastic story telling and fluid gameplay.9.5 / 10"
Positive,"completed my first playthrough with the secret ending had a blast , just remember embrace the monke"
Positive,one of the best games ive played in a long long time
Positive,"MMMMMMMMMMMM YES MONKE WITHA STIK.    Worth the long wait, was starting to think it wasnt gonna be released lul and here we are."
Positive,"It's been a long time since I've sat down and enjoyed a game as much as this one. It's easily one of the best games I've ever played, and I'm absolutely loving it. Would I recommend Black Myth Wukong to other players? Definitely yes!"
Positive,"7800xt perfectly payable at 70-80fps (at least until snake trail) with mostly cinematic and very high setting. Kind of god of war but without the bloated puzzle and difficulty borderline souls game for what seems like optional boss. Story boss seems more manageable and I really hope it stay true. Music, story and graphics were top notch."
Positive,"yes this game is fun to play and explore, good sense of art, good combat design and its very stressful to face some bosses, overall its not perfect but quite a good start for game science to made a significant milestone in chinese gaming history."
Positive,"Reject humanity, return to MONKE"

Positive,wowzers! This is a game of all time.
Positive,Monke play monke gameVery fun to play
Positive,"What can I say that you don't already know? Fantastic game. The feeling of epicness, especially in that intro, is superb. I don't hear enough people praising some of the finest creative ideas in this game, like soundtrack, songs and animations...but just play it and find out for yourself.This game is what developers do when they can work with their hearts instead of statistical data or ideological garbage. A lesson for all.In the meantime let's hope it will happen again and that Black Myth Wukong will help renew the stale state of the game industry by spreading its vibe worldwide."

Positive,"Amazing game, the art, combat, music, story are all fantastic. You can tell a lot of love and time was put into this game and outside of a few minor annoyances this game is near perfect."
Positive,"A Triumph in Gaming - 10/10 Black Myth: Wukong is more than just a game; it’s an experience that transports players to a fantastical world where myth and magic reign supreme. With its stunning visuals, innovative gameplay, and rich narrative, it sets a new standard for action RPGs. Game Science Studios has created a masterpiece that is both a loving homage to classic tales and a bold step forward in gaming.Whether you’re a fan of action RPGs, mythology, or simply looking for an extraordinary gaming experience, Black Myth: Wukong is a must-play. It’s a game that promises to be remembered as a landmark achievement in the industry, and it’s one that you’ll want to revisit time and time again."
Positive,Black Myth: Wukong is an action-packed GOTY contender with crisp moves and stunning views.
Positive,"GOTY masterpiece combat, graphics, story amazing game!"
Positive,"Perfection, worth every penny."
Positive,It is no doubt the game of the year!
Positive,"The game is exquisitely crafted, showcasing the rich and diverse landscapes of China. Exploring the map in the game is truly enjoyable. The difficulty level is a bit challenging for someone like me who is playing a Souls-like game for the first time, but with enough practice, I believe I can get through it."
Positive,for me this is the GOTY 2024
Positive,"Overall Amazing game... Beautiful world, Decent customisation with spells and weapons/armor, and also fun to bonk enemies."
Positive,"End of Chapter 2 at time of review:The game looks great and is a lot of fun. Overall: 8.5/10General Info: This is not a souls-like. Imagine a mix of God of War and Fury. Basically a boss rush with some side quests and tangents in between. Some backtracking involved.Positive:- Visuals (pretty game, pretty world, cool enemies)- Combat (quick, dynamic, very much Asian aRPG style)- Lore (something different, at least for the western audience)- Technical aspects (120fps at 1440p on 7900xt and 5800X3D)- Enemy variety (at least up until time of review in chapter 2)- No microtransactions, no early access, no expensive DLC or bonuses at launch that make you feel fomo. The Deluxe Edition Items have basically no impact. Mid:- Lose story telling, no real exposition dumps or huge story telling cut scenes. You might love this if you want to get into the action, you might hate this as it does not provide a compelling narrative at all times.- Complexity of game world: not an open world, mostly corridors with some side tracking. Again this comes down to your taste. If you like ubisoft games, this will feel cramped. Negative:- Linear level design often ends in invisible walls, sometimes it is hard to understand whether there is going to be a wall or a secret. In some cases it feels a little like checking for invisible doors in classic DOOM. - No full controll over keybinds- As in similar ARPGs, the camera is sometimes your worst enemy in narrow spaces.- When leaving dark areas/caves there is sometimes a lighting issue that results in a weird ""pop-in"" effectOverall an absolute recommendation if you like action RPGs. RETURN TO MONKE!"
Positive,"Great game, too bad that i'm shit and probably wont be able to finish the game."
Positive,a game about furries thats actually not weird! would MONKE again
Positive,"Stunning visuals, satisfying mechanics and mesmerising story. Worth every bucks. Definitely Game of the Year 2024. Don't think just buy it already."
Positive,"I've never been a soullike game player until I try this game, mostly I'm a FPS gamer, but this game is too good to miss, have to admit it still have some little problem, but you have to try it and experience the magic of Chinese culture, go learn Chinese people, we're taking over  :)"
Positive,"After compliting 100% of the game I can say that i will play it even more! It is worth buying and playing, time well spent and i recommed you to do the same!Black Myth Wukong is engaging and immersive since the start of the game. While playing you can enjoy the exploration of its fascinating settings and different challenges. Every boss feels unique and some of them are some of the best i have ever seen and fought regarding boss design, difficulty and graphics. This game has a highly versatile combat system giving you hundres of options and ideas to approach every challenge you encounter in many different ways.It has an amazing storyline with many secrets and plot twists,, i have personaly looked into Wukong's mythology with extra reserch since it was very intresting."
Positive,"Graphics: The visuals are breathtaking, beautifully capturing traditional Chinese aesthetics. Surprisingly, the game runs flawlessly on my old setup with an i7-3960X and GTX 1070, showcasing excellent optimization.Music: The soundtrack is steeped in traditional Chinese melodies, perfectly complementing the game's atmosphere.Gameplay: The boss battles are challenging but incredibly rewarding. The variety of builds allows for a satisfying sense of progression and strategy.Story: While I haven’t completed the game yet, the narrative is already gripping and full of promise.Personally I would give it a 9/10."
Positive,"Overall, BMWukong is an amazing game! Gorgeous graphics, engaging mechanics, well-designed characters. Encountered a few graphical bugs and some lagging after hours of play (possibly due to a hiccup in connection or laptop temperature?) but otherwise it runs well."
Positive,Monkey go BONNKK
Positive,Monkey is good
Positive,"great lore, gameplay and visuals. loving it so far."
Positive,11/10 bonk bonk critical hit
Positive,"This game is truly a masterpiece, showcasing the essence of the ancient Chinese myth Journey to the West in an incredible way... The visuals are stunning, and the story is captivating—it's a fully immersive journey into Chinese culture.I’m really puzzled by some people criticizing the game for lacking diversity... You have to understand, this game is based on traditional Chinese culture... How can you judge it by modern diversity standards? It’s like not criticizing Red Dead Redemption for not having LGBT+ characters, right? After all, that game is set in the American West of the 19th century... Different cultural backgrounds have different ways of representation.Moreover, forcibly adding so-called ""diversity"" elements could ruin the game’s atmosphere and narrative consistency... I believe that a good game should respect its original cultural setting and not be altered to cater to someone’s taste.Black Myth: Wukong exceeds my expectations in terms of artistic expression, cultural depth, and gameplay experience... If you genuinely enjoy Chinese culture or are interested in Journey to the West, this game is absolutely worth playing! For those who criticize it, I think you should learn more about the game’s background instead of simply applying modern standards... This is an absolutely immersive experience in Chinese mythology—highly recommended!For those of you who may not be familiar with Journey to the West, I recommend checking out some classic adaptations, like the 1986 TV series, which is considered one of the most faithful versions of the story. You could also read the original novel Journey to the West, one of China’s Four Great Classical Novels, written by Wu Cheng’en in the 16th century. If you understand this cultural background better, I’m sure you’ll appreciate Black Myth: Wukong even more! Have fun playing!"
Positive,Momentous!.......is all that needs to be said.
Positive,The ultimate Al Taif experience
Positive,"Good game, worth it."
Positive,10/10 - Game of the year.RIP - Sweet baby inc.
Positive,"This is THE BEST Chinese 3A Game at the time this review is written(Aug/24).+++:The plots and lore(10/10) are carefully written and did a pretty nice job portraiting the Chinese novel fantasy Journey to the West. Though you can understand just playing the game, it's HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to read the original novel or you will miss tons of fun.++: Action or gameplay(boss fights) I would say a 8/10. There's lots of styles to play but not enough categories of weapons. However there's insanely amount of boss fights ,so you're in for a treat if you like boss fights.-: BGM are silent most of the time. There's a few good ones, but would not give credit to the devs since they're just using the similar version for TV series. (Rating? How could you rate something that's not even there?)---: level designs are TERRIBLE,5/10. There are just too much invisible walls and you'll often get lost because of poor directions. And there's not much to do between boss fights. Also there's too much hidden elements and usually require a 2nd play through or more.Overall, I'd say it's a 8/10 game on it's own, but +0.5 for THE 1st Chinese 3A game, +0.5 for DEI free content, and +0.5 for the monkey king. 9.5/10"
Positive,"The review is made after I finished 100% of the game in terms of bosses & mini-bosses. This is not a spoiler free Review, but I will put any of them into spoiler marks, so feel free to read it.Let's start with the main thing, Difficulty> Is it on par with Elden Ring difficulty? The short answer: No. Not at all. While you can call this game a member of the ""soulslike"" genre, it doesn't fit too much, the game is more about the story and the overall good feeling into the world they try to put you into. In my opinion none of the bosses are insanely hard except like 4-5 out of all of them, with 3 of them being optional, but the rest are quite decently manageable or easy. Dying to a boss multiple times, is something good, not every boss should be a first try. Where would be the challenge in that? Some bosses are hard, and that's fine, if they were too easy all the time there would be no challenge and it would be just a pure story game (which, also feels decent, the story  takes place after the JTTW, where Wukong died and you are the Destined One to revive him by finding the 6 parts of him that have been scattered in the world ).Gameplay>If you are expecting to play a game based on a high variety of play styles, this is not it, here you are a Stone Monkey. You will fight like a Wukong wannabe, but don't forget you are a wannabe trickster so you will have a lot of tricks in your tool box. From  immobilizing and stopping the time on your opponent while he is mid combo to transforming for a long time in some bosses/npcs and use their abilities as your own.Skill Tree. The main way to power up in this game is by unlocking new combos, attacks and gaining stats through a skill tree. The main thing that is very nice is that you can always change the skill tree points at any point in the game, for as many times you want, at no cost. That let's you have a good way to change your play style if something isn't working for you, you can change to something else for a specific fight and come back to your main build later.Graphics>My PC specs are:RTX 2070 / I7-9700k / 32 GB RAM 3200 CL18 I locked frame rate on 60 FPS and with Texture on Cinematic / Shadows and Reflections on Low / Effect on Very High and the rest on High the game stayed in constant 60 FPS. While there are some bugs at launch with some textures, I believe they will fix them pretty soon. Some textures tend to flicker sometimes but most of the time a good ol' restart of the game fixes them. And with the technical stuff aside, the game looks amazing, the bosses look nice and their movement is fluid. Animations aren't clogging your screen with effects and everything is easy to see. Sound design>From the usual ambient music to songs, the game hits the ambient amazing and not only it tries to transcend you into the world with the visual but even your ears are charmed to take a trip into that Chinese story.  Just imagine you finish the Chapter 1, while you were treated to mainly only ambient music, you are hit with a song at the start, that felt amazing because it stayed on the whole Chapter 2. It felt amazing to be guided by the lyrics of a song..Overall opinion>The game is the Game of The Year, it takes the difficulty and enjoyment of a ""soulslike"" and creates a story driven masterpiece that is enjoyable even for the ones new to the genre and let's them experiment with the genre, without giving up on the ones that like to enjoy some hard bosses on the side."
Positive,"reject woke, embrace monke"
Positive,Awesome game. Good story great game play. I'm on new game+ now and it's more fun the second time through.
Positive,GOTY definitely. Must play. Enjoying every moment of it!!!
Positive,"I'm not much of a review poster as you can probably see, this is my third review that i'm writing and i played hundreds upon hundreds of games, so that means this is the third game that really made me want to write a review.Almost 100 hours into the game, yes i really took my time on my first run, i literally beat the game hours ago aswell and let me tell you, this game is an absolute masterpiece. I wish that i can express in more detail on how i feel about the game, but i just can't, it's that good. The last time i felt this excited, hyped and super happy about playing a game is when Elden Ring came out, this game managed to bring those feelings forward again.Visuals of the game are so damn pretty, graphics are insane i literally built a PC for this game and it was so worth it, combat is out of this world very fluid and engaging, i absolutely loved every character i met, the cutscene animation after ending the chapters were such a treat to watch, oh and not to mention the intro! i don't think there's a game that will top the intro of Wukong, that sh*t was absolutely epic, UI was fantastic, Amazing boss designs which were based off of chinese mythology/folklore i believe and the list keeps on going, so yeah this game is just a beast. I could keep on going but i dont want to make this review way too long.Bottom line is: Buy this game, its just phenomenal. I am hoping that this game will win GOTY it absolutely deserves the award. -  9.5/10 rating from me too."
Positive,Wo shi houzi

Positive,Very cool monkey
Positive,its monkey king
Positive,"This game has really good boss fights, amazing graphics, along with a neat levelling system. I recommend casual and hardcore gamers to try it!"
Positive,"I absolutely love the art direction in this game .. the original style and references to Journey from the West is very refreshing for a game.. A company that focuses on the game play and the story and not politics is also a breath of fresh air for this often stale ""tech"" industry .. so well done Game Science.. for keeping it real ..A couple of Gripes i have while playing the game have to be mentioned.. 1. Inability to replay cut scenes.. There is only one chance to see a boss cut scene .. after you have triggered the boss once .. you always see the boss spawned in the area ..where you found it .. this takes a little bit away from the ability to keep the story front and centre in the game players experience.. Usual way would be to replay the cut scene each time .. and give the player the option of skipping the cut scene when it plays .. if they want to get straight to the action.. Many many many times in this game i have wandered into some open area only to find myself smack bang in the middle of a boss fight i didnt anticipate .. didnt have time to buff.. didnt have any idea that it was going to be a boss.. this is a bit of a problem because most times this means you DEFINITELY have to re do the boss.. you might have no health no manna no focus .. and you are forced into a boss scene with out any ability to actually prepare to beat the Boss..2. The Cut scenes from boss kill scenes i found are often jerky .. that is they do not transition smoothly .. i would assume this is a technical problem with the way UE5 handles going from rendered video playback to real time action .. 3. NPC enemies often replenish health when you run from an area where they spawn .. but can still see them .. Many times ive almost taken down a tough enemy .. and run away to heal .. in order to be able to finish him off.. only to find that when i return .. (not very far away) the enemy i just beat down to a sliver of his HP has totally replenished all of his HP.. this makes the game a bit annoying.. i wonder if anyone else has experienced this ..There are some other minor UI issues .. Such as the Wind spell / Fire protection Buff .. being assigned to the Left Stick and RT .. this basically means that any time you are moving as you move with the Left stick .. you are very likely to trigger this move when you are TRYING to trigger a spell .. because by default you are MOVING when you hold RT .. to trigger a spell like Imobilize and instead you end up using the wind charm .. first.. it would be better to assign this to the Left Bumper as it seems to be assigned to nothing ?.. I am more than half way through chapter 4 and really do enjoy the game .. apart from a few of these technical quirks .. that could be improved for better game play experience.. Respect to Game Science for creating a completely unique world .. in this game .. where the player can immerse themselves  in the story and enjoy overcoming challenging and rewarding Bosses and enemies alike..i Would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes these kinds of games..and no its NOT a ""soulslike"" ..:)"
Positive,"Bosses jump across the whole arena to hit you, so basically when you think you are safe you are not ( game is fun 👍)"
Positive,"overall really fun game, its hard for sure but not like a game like darksouls its easier but in my opinion way more fun. its a good buy for sure"
Positive,Monkey have stick Monkey BONK bad guy
Positive,This game is clearly in my top 10 best game I've played in my entire life !!
Positive,"it's a lot of fun, my pc is avg, 16gb ddr4 3200mhz, i5 10400 & rx7800xt.  Haven't had a single crash, easy to get great performance with great image quality. If you don't use RT lmao.  Traversal stutter hasn't been an issue, occasionally on a new area it will stutter for a frame or two, but barely noticeable, but that's an (unbelievably still) an ongoing UE issue.Just wanted to add the game got a lot of flak for not having a map or navigation of any sort, and because the first chapter is quite linear it really wasn't an issue. But due to the later chapters twisting level design and larger areas it might be an issue for some.  I personally love it, had it been an option i probably would've used it and missed out on the sense of reward from exploring and finding secret areas and bosses.  Which the game needs (can be pretty linear with invisible walls).  I'm only into chapter 5 and I know for a fact i missed some things in chapter 3.  Character design is incredible, weapons, transformations, spells and armour all look detailed and well thought out.  Boss fights can be incredibly tough, but finding a particular item can make it so much easier.  As i mention later i'm not the best at these games, but I found some bosses way easier than some did online, but had way more trouble with others that most considered easy.Really great builds available to use too, excellent in that regard. Ways to boost attack etc, won't spoil anything.Game has received a lot of praise for it's graphics, but the sound work is excellent, little hairy dude's voice(guy at the start) reminds me of the little guy from Ninja Scroll.  And little details like the staff breaking things as you run past it, or dragging in sand etc, it's pattern changing depending on it's position when it comes in contact is noice.Game play itself relies on dodging and a build that suits the spells and techniques equipped.  Being able to re roll your build at anytime is excellent.  I wasn't expecting much tbh, but 24hrs in (I'm rubbish at these games, like taking 20+ attempts to beat the bloodthirsty tiger bad) but really loving it. Would recommend for the game play alone."
Positive,fire ah game
Positive,"Coming from a background in monster hunter, I believe that those who appreciate action role-playing games will find Black Myth: Wukong to be an extremely action-packed and thrilling game. This game has been really enjoyable and difficult for someone who has never played Dark Souls or Elden Ring. Even though I kept dying to various bosses, it forced me to study the monster pattern and devise my own unique strategy to defeat them. I'm grateful to Game Science for adapting my childhood into such a fantastic game, and I'm looking forward to the next installment in the trilogy. PS: For those who have watched Chinese ancient & fantasy dramas and can understand Chinese, the English translation significantly deviates from the speech itself.100% the game!! Can't wait for the DLCs!! 中国万岁!!"
Positive,"Super amazing game. High graphics, fun storyline, and a great representation of what a video game can be like. Note for the ones who has a rather normal laptop/computer, use low graphics mode! It stops your game from crashing, and tbh the graphics is still better than many games."
Positive,great game beautiful cenimatic
Positive,"To the top, game of the year, bit hard some places but really fun game."
Positive,Good. Monkey swing stick. Things hit with stick. Nice
Positive,"This game has it all, hands down the best game I've ever played."
Positive,"Amazing, haven't played a good game in a long time. This reminds me of how much I used to love playing as a kid, no other game has done that for me"
Positive,"Good game, fluid, fun. Runs well on 1080.Have some souls elements but feels more like GoW.Great scenery and concept art, decent storytelling.Monke!"
Positive,"Playing this, gave me the same amount of excitement when I played God of war (2018) for the very first time. Being the first AAA title from the developer, I think they pretty much nailed it.This is what I was able to gather during my short playtime.Pros:1. A+ combat mechanics. Easy enough to learn, complex enough to keep it interesting.2. Art and sound direction are on point. Absolutely stunning. Especially the variety of bosses.3. Well optimized. I'm averaging 70-80 fps in high settings on my Zephyrus G14 4060.4. The skill point system is well thought of. Rewards you even if you keep dying when doing boss rush. Cons:1. I wished the game had mo-caped for English dialogues and had better dialogues in general. It kinda throws me off when the characters talk. I might switch the language to Chinese and make do with English subtitles.A solid fun game.Update after playing around 50 hours of it:----------------------------------------------------------One hell of a game. I think I'm at the final chapter now (chapter 6) and there are still so many hidden quests and rewards in the previous realms which I had totally missed. The amount of replay-ability even on your first playthrough is insane.There are so many build varieties you can choose to go with, each massively changing how you do boss battles. They pretty much nailed that.Making a single player RPG this good while the other game publishers focused on releasing cash grabs one after another is a feat on its own and definitely marks a milestone for Asian game studios in general. Hoping to see more passion projects like these. Rooting for GOTY!!!"
Positive,game of the year
Positive,"After beating the game 1 time around I can easily say its the most fun ive had playing a game overall. though theres 2 things that keep me from fully endorsing the game, and by god do they infuriate me.1. The bosses notably drop in quality as you progress through the chapters of the game. It turns the skill requirement into a skill suggestion, replacing your instincts with memorizing timing and cheese strategies. examples of this include bosses (and yes, they exist, pretty commonly too) with jank hitboxes, hitscan equivalent attacks and zoning. (im looking at you, supreme inspector and duskveil, go to hell)2. the game even after the patch STILL crashes way too commonly to not address it. i guess its a radeon thing. but the opening cutscene is still not safe to play as well as other general areas of the game. twice was i booted from the game after beating the final boss within an inch of its life.3 (probably just an issue on my end, but still worth saying): after the game crashes, it actually breaks file explorer, meaning my windows hotbar and file explorer wont function properly unless i restart file explorer using task manager. this, is virus level stuff.10/10 game aside from that, once its all ironed out that $60 price tag is well worth it. not recommending the game until they fix this though."
Positive,Story 10/10 - Combat 10/10 - Music 10/10 - Optimize 10/10I love this game so much... this is 100% GOTY!

Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a groundbreaking masterpiece that sets a new standard in action RPGs. From the moment you enter its beautifully crafted world, you’re captivated by its breathtaking visuals and immersive atmosphere. The game’s art direction is nothing short of spectacular, with every environment rich in detail and alive with the magic of ancient Chinese mythology.The combat system is a perfect blend of fast-paced action and strategic depth, offering exhilarating battles that challenge and engage. Each encounter feels unique, with a variety of powers and abilities that keep gameplay fresh and exciting.The narrative is deeply rooted in the legend of the Monkey King, brought to life through compelling characters and a story that draws you in from start to finish. The sound design and musical score further elevate the experience, making every moment unforgettable.In short, Black Myth: Wukong is not just a game—it’s an epic adventure that redefines what’s possible in gaming. It’s a must-play for anyone seeking an extraordinary journey."
Positive,"I am only on chapter 3 but I already feel like I can recommend this game.Forget the vague ""souls-like"" definition, this is an action game that's almost a boss rush with some cool exploration and some regular enemy encounters between each boss. I honestly love the idea of fighting so many 1vs1 fights, against beautifully designed enemies that are different from each other (so far I only found 1 reskinned boss out of 20ish).The combat system is solid, the game doesn't have many combos (which I don't mind) and it requires you to use dodges and skills with the right timing, while you focus on building your own meter for stronger heavy attacks that will also help you to stagger the enemies. Imo it's simple but effective, and you will find a lot of satisfaction in chain-staggering stronger foes with a series of heavy attacks and skills.One thing I have to complain though is navigating the world: the game has no map and a lot of areas that, while visually stunning, don't look too different from each other when you have to remember where something, like a locked door you left behind, was. The enormous amount of invisible walls also makes it hard to tell where you can and cannot go.And since the game has tons of secrets (some of which are very hard to find without a guide), all of this makes finding them even harder and somewhat frustrating."
Positive,"Monkey play, monkey happy"
Positive,this game has the power to make you feel like a monkey
Positive,Surpassed all my expectations. It has some minor flaws but a good game nonetheless. Much recommended.
Positive,"Okay so 20 hours and I think i`ve completed all of chapter 1 and 90% of chapter 2 doing chapter 3 now. If this is an linear game then I never want to play a open world again, chapter 1 was alright but chapter 2 was so huge, when I found the final boss there was so much more I could explore and I fought bosses just to unlock more bosses, This game is so much fun, and exploring is actually rewarding, you get unique stuff, One hidden boss even gave me an item to help with the final boss, thats crazy. Its been a while since ive seen a game reward you for exploring instead of just giving u cosmetics for u character. I have so many transformations I can use because of exploring i`m beginning to think ill actually end up with 72 transformations at the end of the game lolI cant wait to see what chapter 3 has in store for me."
Positive,"It has an engaging story, many bosses and enemies, decent fighting mechanisms, a well-done skill tree, and upgradable equipment and armor.  The game deserves its Overwhelmingly Positive review ranking; the reviews are not wrong!"
Positive,"Very good game, I love the gameplay and the Chinese setting; it tells such a great story. I've also never been so addicted to a game as I am to this one.In Sekiro, for example, I didn't like the parrying, but I did enjoy the smooth gameplay. In Elden Ring, the gameplay was better for me than in Sekiro, but it was a bit slower. For me, Wukong combined both, and it was just fun. The animations after each chapter were also simply impressive to me. 10/10"
Positive,I truly enjoyed playing the game even though I haven't finished it I can already feel the love and care the team put into making the game.
Positive,Solid action. Beautiful graphics. Pure game.
Positive,monke game make me happy
Positive,"Masterpiece, what a beautiful game. It was worth the wait."
Positive,Peak gaming experience
Positive,Very fun and not too hard. Amazing story and 10/10 graphics.
Positive,"this game is amazing, so much stuff to discover and i'm still at chapter2! just remember that this is primarly an action game, not an open world one even if the areas are huge. the art direction is super, that headless monk plays so well that i had to search the musician on yt. it's so good that i got the deluxe upgrade in the first 2 hours after started playing it."
Positive,"Good game, despite what the creators claim, it is a soulslike, and a very good one at that. The game definitely gets pretty difficult at times but it never feels too unfair that it makes me want to give up on it. There are plenty of spells that you can use and level up which allow for a pretty good range of options to use against bosses.The story is also good, quite hard to follow but you can understand it if you have some previous knowledge of the wukong legend and the tale of the journey to the west. The gameplay is really good and although can feel a little unresponsive at first, once you get the hang of it, it feels really rewarding and satisfying to get good at.It performs decently well, I'm using an RX 6800 and 7 7800X3D and with some small sacrifices to visual quality I'm getting a pretty consistent 100-110 fps. There are plenty of options to tune graphical settings and get the ideal performance for you and there is also the free benchmark tool available on steam which allows you to tinker with the settings and get a good idea of how the game will perform.The game is linear which means there isn't a tonne of exploration to be done and I've seen some complaints that the game feels like a boss rush which I totally understand however I personally feel like they have struck a good balance with the exploration and regular boss fights.Another thing to add is that the game actually does feel finished and feels like what a full release should be, with plenty of content and very few bugs.So far I would give the game a 9/10 and would definitely recommend picking it up and giving it a go yourself, at least the first hour or so so you can refund if its not the right game for you. :)"
Positive,"Wukong is a brother of king kong but without king but wukong is also king with wu without king , dafaq im saying, im off bye bye good game 10/10"
Positive,"Definitely the game of the year, a complete work of art. I hope they continue working on it."
Positive,"Maybe not considered ""souls like"" but it's at least souls inspired and rightfully so.Good game, good graphics even if the clouds seem to be censored for some reasonLoved the amount of bosses and the souls like boss difficultyVarious stances to choose from and not having to keep switching from one to the other if you massively prefer one to another and it wont really hinder your game experience End of chapters animations were really good and wholesome and some sad'lack of inclusivity and diversity"" bro it's a fantasy game so terms like that are mentally backwards. There were complaints that there were no women in the game when there clearly are. Games do not need to conform to mentally unstable game journalists woke people begging for black people to be in it, lgbt, or even trans. A game is a game meant to be enjoyed and not to be used as a means to brainwash people into some propaganda. and bro it's a game about a fighting monkey and celestial beings like any of that is real I liked the gameplay, it's nice to have a game that does not rely on your typical guns or swords like every other single game does. Fighting mostly with a blunt weapon like a staff is a nice change. Depending on your build and playstyle you will find some things super easy and some harder. I had this experience with a friend who played at the same time as me. He was mainly pillar stance and i was just smash stance. Bosses he destroyed I struggled with, and bosses i wiped the floor with he struggled with. It all depends on how you build your character in the game that decides how your experience is going to be like and that is beautiful, and you can gain more sparks to change that or re-spec like a souls game to change your build, or wait until ng+ LIKE A SOULS GAME to play with a different build. This game is definitely at least souls inspired and you cant deny that at all, and if you do them maybe try going therapy to not be in denial. besides, a game being called souls like is a compliment not an insult overall, the game is no less than an 8/10. -Everyone saying bosses are hared? grow up, try again, quit whining-Everyone complaining about frame rate drops? check your pc build, that's why they had a free test for the game to see if the game would run well on your pc-Everyone saying it aint at least souls inspired? maybe start a business into how to be so deep in denial-Everyone being woke and saying no diversity and no inclusivity? literally no one cares, go back to all of the other failed games that provided those things for youFor me this game is a 9/10. What dropped it for me was the last chapter that felt kinda washed up and abruptly changing to open world after so many hours was just weird."

Positive,"Game Review: A Journey Worth Every SecondGood: This game hooked me like no other, and I found myself immersed for five days straight. The combat is exhilarating, the graphics are stunning, and the story is captivating—one of the best I’ve seen in a while. However, it’s not as straightforward as most games. To fully appreciate the narrative, you need some background in Chinese mythology, particularly the classic tale ""Journey to the West."" I had to watch a few YouTube videos to get up to speed, but it was worth it.The boss fights, in particular, are nothing short of spectacular. Each one is unique, challenging, and utterly insane. The best for me was the ERLANGGGGGGGG boss fight. I had to do the same fight for 6 hrs straight. Some times the theme plays in my head when I go sleep.The music also deserves special mention. The soundtrack perfectly complements the action and story, heightening the emotional impact of key scenes. The music team absolutely nailed it, delivering hype and tension exactly when needed.Bad: While the game is nearly flawless, there are some technical issues that can be frustrating. Occasionally, I encountered glitches that required a quick restart to fix. It’s a minor inconvenience, but something I hope gets patched soon.Conclusion: Overall, this game is a masterpiece that’s absolutely worth the price. The storytelling, combat, graphics, and music all come together to create an unforgettable experience. Even with its minor technical hiccups, it’s a solid 10/10 in my book. If you’re a fan of mythology or just looking for a game that will consume your time in the best possible way, this is it."

Positive,"When I was a kid I imagined games in the future being like this. A true once in a lifetime experience. My only critique is I will never be able to blindly play it again. Some call it a God of War clone, or a soulslike but it really is neither. It pulls aspects from those games as well as others but manages to make them uniquely it's own. I don't know when the next time a game of this caliber will come it.Knocked it out of the park, 13/10."

Positive,I am Monke
Positive,"Great game, highly recommend."
Positive,"Honestly one of the greatest games ive played this year. great music,awesome combat,and great story. but only flaw is that either the map is way too confusing and im lost or the bosses get very toxic for example the end boos of chapter 2 for me was just bullshit but i still enjoyed it cause it reminded me of sekiro (a game i love). safe to say this game has become one of my all time favs. BUT for people who are considering to buy this be aware that the bosses in this act more like a souls like then a RPG. they are harder and more toxic for ie God of war. Cheers!"
Positive,"Awesome Game, really is some good fun.I dont care what the 'Haters' say or claim, Play it for yourself.Im not even that big into the 'Souls-Like' genre of games, but I found some joy after getting through what I consider a rough start. It has a very interesting story too. In saying that, I have only made it to Chapter 2, but this is so different in story I cannot help but be curious about it. 10/10 I would recommend to anyone who likes games like these"

Positive,"Really surprised how well this game was put together. First 10-15 hrs i enjoyed but felt a slight lack of upgrade or growth. As i progressed to mid-game it expanded to exactly what was needed. If you explore and do not skip or fast track to each chapters bosses, you can unlock so much. The game is truly a masterpiece."
Positive,"Amazing combat and progression system, pretty good story imo, good level design, and cool secrets. 9.5/10"
Positive,Long live to the Monkey
Positive,"The game Is heat, plus monkey man."
Positive,Fantastic Action RPG that borrows elements from souls-like games and GoW 2018 & GoW:Ragranok. Excellent in many aspects and does not disappoint with the amount of hype it has received.
Positive,"Its graphics are insane, but it is, for how far I've gotten, a boss rush game where you face a boss every 10 minutes of exploring. I think for people experienced within this genre it is very recommended. However, for me the difficulty curve is way too steep and I started losing interest quickly after doing the same fight over and over again. This can be a positive side of it as some people do look for a challenge. But thought I'd mention it, just for the more casual gamers out there."
Positive,"9/10I wanted to wait until I finished the game before reviewing it so I could have a more comprehensive take and offer a few thoughts:Firstly, the game is a work of art. The visuals and music are both beautiful and epic. I highly recommend playing it in Chinese and having subs for the most immersive and authentic experience.Regarding the gameplay, I remember one of the first things that struck me was how fun it was to try again and again on bosses - It's so well designed in its pacing for you to a. learn the patterns and move-sets of individual bosses and b. advancing your natural power progression in relation to your journey to make you always feel appropriately powerful and badass. The game gives you options and freedom to play and try things out and they're all cool and fun. From start to finish, every boss fight made my adrenaline spike, palms sweat and heart race at each victory as they were all so satisfyingly challenging that I'd catch myself audibly celebrating to myself. I can't think of another game that's so consistently done that for me.You don't lose XP/money for dying + it is free to respec.These two fundamental mechanics makes it so you never go backwards in your progress, and because you don't lose anything you focus solely on the core gameplay/combat and just play without worrying; which brings me to another major observation I have about the game which is that it is very cleverly streamlined. It doesn't have a lot of meaningless quests and errands for you to run and arbitrarily waste your time but there is plenty to find and explore, much of it hidden away.I feel like this all driven from a philosophy of making the game feel as fun and rewarding as possible without diluting the cinematic quality.It isn't always common for a bestiary or compendium to be interesting and worth poring over every entry, but Black Myth: Wukong has one of the best I've ever seen, and each entry; beautifully written, helps immerse you in the mythology of Journey to the West.The environments while so stunning, can feel stiff and limiting with their invisible walls after playing something like Elden Ring. I really hope this studio makes an open-world game in the future. However, this was most noticeable at the start of the game and wasn't an issue by the end, more disappointing since you can easily imagine the potential in the environments.There are many things I don't want to spoil. It's just such a beautiful game."
Positive,GOTY 2024 Aside from small things 10/10
Positive,Totally worth the 5 year wait.
Positive,"Masterpiece 10/10 It doesn't feel like a game, but an interactive movie."

Positive,"Black Wukong made me feel like the Monkey King himself—minus the cool tail and actual powers. I'd give it 9/10 and happily take on mythical creatures again,but only after a banana break."
Positive,"EDIT: After finishing the game and getting the True Ending, I can safely say the hate surrounding this game was kinda crazy. For something that is a studio's first foray into this genre of game it is AMAZING. Game, of course, is graphically beautiful and is probably it's major selling point. The spectacle and hype you feel while during some of the boss-fights is unmatched IMO, but the gameplay is nothing to sleep on either, evolving with you as you play the game and master the mechanics. Definitely pick up this game if you're a fan of the modern God of War games or soulsbornes in general! 9/10"
Positive,"No in-game shop, no battle pass, buy once and get the full game, plus a combat system that feels great, stunning visuals, and a wild story.9/10The game is most comparable to the new God of War titles but features several Soulslike mechanics (bonfires and respawning enemies).The levels are fairly linear but packed with things to discover and are visually very well designed. Some sections feel more like a boss rush, but there are also plenty of areas to explore. Unfortunately, many invisible walls are used to prevent players from going out of bounds. If that had been handled better, I’d give it a 10/10.All in all, this is a clear GOTY contender."
Positive,"If you liked God of War, Stellar Blade, Elden Ring, anything Souls like.... yeah, you'll probably be like me and throw your money at it.I'm enjoying the game.  I don't know much of the Chinese lore, so it is a fun way to learn a little bit about it."
Positive,What a solid game so far. It’s easy to understand the build you’re going for or the style that suits you. The visual and sound is very exciting and you don’t want to skip a thing. the lore and concept is well done so far! But i still have much to explore and i can’t wait to finish the game :)

Positive,If you like God of War or Assassins Creed you'll enjoy this game.
Positive,Great game runs good on a 2070 on high setting but does lag in the cinematic's but overall great.  The game is great i think it might deserve game of the year.  Also this is not my type of game but i really wanted to try it and it does get more harder the farther you go and more fun for people who like Elden Ring and Dark Souls games but it is fun would play again.
Positive,"Score: 8.5/10Story:What more can be said? The narrative is rooted in a true literary masterpiece. There are some interpretations that I find intriguing and aligned with the overall message the game seeks to convey, though I might have differing views on certain aspects of how they twisted the original story. However, that's purely subjective and doesn't detract from the quality of the story.Visuals and Design:I absolutely love the landscapes, character designs, and costumes. As someone who grew up reading Journey to the West, seeing the novel's mythical creatures brought to life in the game is an exhilarating experience. The environments are breathtaking and immersive, with the grand Buddha statues and some architectural elements leaving a profound impact on me. The game features some of the most stunning scenery I've ever encountered, and they all feel authentically reminiscent of places I’ve actually seen. It’s simply marvelous.Boss Design:The boss designs are quite impressive, with some moves that are visually striking and others that are distinctly unique. What sets them apart is that, they defy conventional tropes and offer a refreshing experience. This uniqueness is a credit to the original author of the novel and the ancient Chinese folklore he drew upon.I really like some of the bosses, but I can’t go into details since I want to avoid spoilers.Combat System:The combat animations are cool, and the spells are visually captivating, especially because I’m a huge fan of Wukong. The way the spells are represented aligns well with my expectations.However, this is where my main critique lies. I prefer engaging in combat by directly confronting enemies rather than relying heavily on dodging and waiting for an opening to strike, as in Souls-like games. This game isn’t a Souls-like, or at least it attempts to incorporate more character abilities, primarily through spell. In my opinion, the key distinction between action games and Souls-like games lies in how players can influence enemy behavior. Action games allow for interruptions, counters, and disruptions, rewarding players for such high-risk maneuvers with a strong sense of satisfaction.In this game, the Monkey can interrupt or parry enemies, but it’s done through heavy after light attack or spells rather than the core combat system. This, to me, is the biggest issue: it lacks a dedicated blocking or counter system, placing too much emphasis on dodging. Parrying with heavy is a nice idea to bring the fluidity into the combat but in quite a lot time you just fail. Also there are a lot of attacks which cannot be parry and the only option is to dodge, or use magic. This results in less interactive combat, which diminishes the overall experience. (In my opinion Ghost of Tsushima had excellent interactivity, though I understand it’s a different scenario with mostly human bosses in a low-magic setting.)Overall, I feel that while the heavy parry derived from the staff techniques and the spell abilities are intriguing, they fall short in delivering the level of interactivity needed to make the combat feel rewarding. Once the novelty wears off, the battles can feel somewhat monotonous.Map:The map is decent. Personally, I don't have a strong opinion on invisible walls, though I understand why others might find them frustrating. What I do wish for is a mini-map because I often struggle with navigation. Relying on online guides to find my way slightly detracts from the overall experience.Chapters:The game boasts one of the coolest and most epic prologues I've ever seen, delivering a significant impact. The first four chapters are solid, offering plenty of content and expansive maps. However, chapters five and six feel a bit rushed and could have been more fleshed out.The side quests are not very clear and you could miss them."
Positive,"Wukong is a fiction character I like the most since childhood. Have been waiting for years after first view of this game. Finally I got to play. The best visual I have ever seen in A-RPG.  The battles and the plots are also very impressive. Way to go, China game company!"

And best of all: it doesn't have any DEI, Woke, Ideology etc BS on the game, it's just awesome!The game is heavily focused on boss fight and mini boss fights, which is awesome and i love it, but i really wish there were more puzzles, small side-quest, just like the ones we find in Resident Evil, Lords of The Fallen for example, that way it would make exploration even more fun.The most important aspect the game has a ton which is the fun factor.So, i definitely recommend this game."
Positive,"Amazing ARPG which has lots of unique bosses with their own move set, the graphic of this game is top of the line. Combat is definitely fun, and more in line of GOD OF WAR than soul-like games. You would have access to all kinds of spells and transformations, which are fun and very helpful to overcome some of the more challenge bosses. Even thought the map level design definitely has some room for improvement, the overall exploring experience is satisfy. The Lore and story in Wukong is deeply rooted on the original story ""Journey to west"". However for the short animations, side quests, back stories, you can understand just fine with a little bit of reading from the in-game journal. Honestly, it's a gem in this game if you are interesting in Chinese methodology.The short animations are some of the biggest surprises, its a Chinese version of ""Love,death&robot"". Nevertheless to say, this is my favorite game so far this year."
Positive,8.5/10should be GOTY this year
Positive,"This game is a testament to how detail, visuals, immersion and optimisation should be implemented in a AAA game, irrespective of the argument of if the game is good or not. A genuine breath of fresh air."
Positive,"A worthy successor to Elden Ring and definitely game of the year. It's easier than Elden Ring, but keeps up with it in every other category - gameplay, lore, graphics, etc."
Positive,"I don't know man, every corner that I took made me feel like I was watching a insane cinematic, the graphics, the environment are just so immersive. I love to open this game and be mesmerized."
Positive,"Beautiful graphics, outstanding combat dynamics, best game I've played in recent years."
Positive,"Damn guys! This is an awesome game, never expected this output. I'm playing on Steamdeck OLED and I'm more than satisfied with the visuals and gameplay on the deck. The story, narration, action feels amazing in the last 3.5hrs. Especially when it's RPG, and open world, deadly combination. Thanks for sorting out my weekend. Enjoying every bit of the game🍻"
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong is a incredible first AAA game by the chinese studio (Game Science)+ Quality, quantity Bosses + Art styles, creatures + (almost) Everything visuals+ 10/10 final bosses+ Often great cinematography & cutscenes+ Transforms + Many cool secrets  + Many surprises that I wont spoil+ Great soundtrack- Some boss hitboxes aren't very accurate- The game could've had a few more staff combos- immersion breaking (poorly hidden) invisible walls - sharpening filter that is on by default and can't be turned off- Camera for some bosses is way to zoomed in.Overall: Great - 8.5/10This studio has in 1 game become one of the TOP melee based action game studios to pay attention to."
Positive,"I got to tell you, it was perfect, perfect, everything; down to the last minute details."
Positive,This game goes hard
Positive,Game of the year!!!
Positive,"Depois de um tempo de espera gigantesco e muito hype por trás, Black Myth Wukong é definitivamente um dos jogos de macaco já feitos"
Positive,"Fun, straightforward, action game. Plus, monke."
Positive,"Reject Modernity, Embrace Monke"
Positive,"[Note: I am already 107 hours into the game and completed every possible aspects, despite what my playtime suggests, most of them were in offline. I finished NG+4 already and this is my authentic and heartfelt review for this incredible game]This game reminded me of the old school video game experiences, in a very pleasant way. I liked how their primary goal with this game was to just make the core gameplay loop fun and accessible. The combat is some complexity with various spells and stances without being overwhelming. There are some sick play you can pull off if you are into that stuff. The hitboxes are super solid (except the final boss in chapter 3), there aren't many annoying scripted fights (again, except that boss), The weapon upgrades are very meaningful and let's you go wild with the build varieties. I have seen people call this game essentially 'boss rush: the video game', and I think that fundamentally sums up my experience as well. Although my first playthrough took longer than the later 3 combined, it was mostly me wandering at every corner of the map and fighting mobs & collecting loots. Which there are tons to collect. The bosses are incredibly unique and fun, each have their own stories to tell, the fights are challenging but very fair. The exploration is thorough, if only somewhat hindered by very lame and stupid invisible walls. In fact this gives us an opportunity to talk about some of the negatives of this game. We'll get into that soon. First I need to talk about the amount of secrets the game tries to hide from the players, and how incredibly rewarding it was for me figure out each of them. The boss fights in each of the secret locations were some of the highlights for me in the entire game. It's also commendable how diverse each of the biomes are in this game. No chapter plays or looks like the others. Each have different elemental affinities to deal with, different lore behind them.At the end of each chapters, there are animation clips regarding the backstory of the related characters of that chapter. They are all incredibly well made and tells the story in such captivating way, they made me look further into the wukong lore on the internet and I must say, I'm grateful for that.The overall writing and voice acting is also really good. Tough bosses sounds intimidating and allies sounds convincing, all without any cringe dialogues. There's also no handholding, as the companion we get don't string along for too long for me to get annoyed. Let's talk map design choices first, the amount of times while I got my immersion ruined by an invisible wall was staggering. I would be exploring a part of a zone and be like 'oh that looks cool over there,' approach that location only to get hit by an invisible wall, even though they clearly designed that place and totally looks accessible from outside the wall.Item progressions are weird - for example, we get Jade Essence in chapter 3 near the end, but in the same chapter earlier we get Bluebridge Romance which is just way better. Has three soaks slots and recover the same amount of health. But these are more of nitpick than actual criticism. They probably done this so players who misses a lot of stuffs get at least something in their runs.I also did not like the fact that they tied achievement progression to some farmable items, and It wouldn't be any problem if the drop rates were reasonable. Feels like they were so used to the lootbox drop rates, they just implemented similar drop rate into the single-player title as well.There is NO MICROTRANSACTION in this game, however.It's a complete game, decent optimization for a game that uses Denuvo trash. I wish it didn't, it's shitty to purposefully implement invasive DRMs into Singleplayer games. There are DLCs in the making, probably coming next year."
Positive,"glad to be the Monkey King. what a wonderful journey,  the culture and architecture of the East are fascinating"
Positive,What can i say？Wu Kong NB！！！！！！！！！！
Positive,holy w game
Positive,Game of the year is all I'm saying
Positive,"Wukong feels like a streamlined version of a Souls game, focusing more on the boss battles and cutting out a lot of the usual filler. It strikes a nice balance by being more forgiving outside of the boss battles, so you’re not constantly punished for every mistake—no losing everything upon death or dealing with frustratingly cheap mobs. It’s like getting straight to the best parts without all the extra fluff.If you love the challenge of Souls-like combat but appreciate a more focused experience, Wukong is well worth the hype."
Positive,Beautiful and perfectly crafted souls like adventure across china's mythology.
Positive,Game is legit
Positive,This game is truly stunning. The opening scene is just WOW. There are very minor stutters in Chapter 2 but overall the performance is amazing. The visuals is ORGASMIC. The story telling in this game is perfect. The little short story after each chapter we get is true cinema. The music is soo well done to the point that I have downloaded it off youtube to just listen everyday. Its really beautifully composed. Its one of those games where you know for a fact the devs poured their heart out in this game and it shows. 10/10. This is quite literally the best story mode single player game i have ever played. Absolute masterpiece of a game. Congrats GameScience. You deserve it. Fck you Sweetbabyinc :D
Positive,Best Game ever.
Positive,Fun bosses and challenging but not insanely difficultMap is gorgeous and has a lot to explore but its easy to get frustratingly lost. Finding a map guide online helps out a lot with this.
Positive,This game was inspired by the Chinese classical fiction Journey to the WestWith fantastic boss fight and perfect movement design
Positive,I wish my computer can play this game.
Positive,Way better than expected. The only thing missing is a Map. must play for everyone.
Positive,"Im about 10 hours in and so far I've loved the mini and big boss fights, the level designs and the minimalistic styled story. The end of chapters feels like you are watching an anime that wraps things up nicely tapestries give you a beautiful summary of the events that took place. I sometimes wish I had a map but I also love the idea of not always knowing where I am and it feels more like a journey and mystery that way  I can just keep trying new things. The combat is tight and snappy and you need to be reactive and on you A game to take out certain enemies and they all have their own unique patterns that you need to learn and it feels fulfilling once you do. This game is absolutely worth it to play and feels like a breath of fresh air as it is a unique look inside of uncommonly charted Chinese folklore."
Positive,"It's got smooth combat, like butter on a hot pancake. The hidden bosses are legit tough, but super fun to beat. The story's really good if you try to understand it, and I love how they're all Chinese-themed with goblin vibes.Some dude from Game Rant complained there are no female characters. Thankfully they didn't make this a game about a gay Chinese superhero either.The only con is I wish there was a guard system, and maybe they could have made the combat less forgiving so that there is more direct skill based difficulty within the system but that might be the FromSoft fan in me speaking. Overall, this game is a total win. It's fun, easy to learn, lots of replay value and perfect for anyone who wants a good time."
Positive,"Absolute eye-candy graphics, banger music, fluid combat, and 5 mins between each boss. 👌"
Positive,from mokong tu wukong
Positive,9.5/10 please stop the mute protagonist trend thanks
Positive,"Hi All,So Starting with that im one of the last people who would even Touch Soul like games im having so much FUN with Wukong.Game is just awesome the graphic gameplay skills options to build your character is just pure gold. Im not even mad spending 2-3h fighting a Boss but my wife is :D Overall game is greate one thing i would like to have like more options when it comes to equipment some upgrades or farming some bosses to drop some Unique Gear."
Positive,"This guys brings back the vibe which I have experienced since I was younger, watching Journey To The West (1986), besides the game is amazing, just need a compass or a mini map"
Positive,"first try'd wandering wight btw (no damage, no heals, no transformation)i don't lie on the internet."
Positive,this monkey got some crazy ass moves
Positive,"I'm not too far along yet due to irl time constraints but I've loved every second of what I have played. The game is stunning, draws from a beloved Chinese folktale, the combat is right up my alley, and I quite enjoy the difficulty. Love the ambient environment and the OST as well. I cannot wait to have more free time so I can dive deeper into the story. I play the game with Chinese voiceovers, but I listened to English ones as well, and honestly, I feel like they nailed Sun Wukong. He has the high-pitched, smug, teasing voice of a trickster monkey god, and I find it very fitting! Great game, hard to believe it's this studio's first AAA venture! I hear they have more games based on Chinese mythology in the works (not sure if true, but I hope it is) so I look forward to those as well, based on my experience with Black Myth Wukong so far!"
Positive,"As a chinese I am very proud of the developers that made this game. They have proven to the world that single player games are still alive, and we chinese dont just make cash grabbing mobile games. However the game is not a masterpiece like some people claimed. - alot of invisible walls- gear and itemization are non existent because you always wear the newest gear set asap since they give better stats. Stats on gear are also very boring, often just gives you 2 stats: armor and some other stat.- explorations are very limited, some levels offer very few options to explore- combat is something i did not really like. You constantly trying to build up heavy attack with light attacks, and you can get interrupted while casting that heavy attack which is frustrating since you dont get any of the charges back.- lack of resource free parry or block options. In order to block or parry, you have to use an ability that turns you into stone, and they cost a lot of mana to do so. Once you ran out of mana, you can't block anymore except dodging.These are obviously nickpicking but i hope their next game will address these issues. Overall this is a great game, I really enjoyed it."
Positive,Very enjoy play this game.
Positive,Nice monkey game
Positive,Great graphics and combat. It is more like GoW than souls-like game. Definitly work the play
Positive,"Graphics: 10/10The visuals are absolutely stunning, but I'm really looking forward to proper optimization. It’s frustrating to only get around 80 FPS on medium settings with an RTX 3090, and during intense firefights, especially with a lot of fire effects, the framerate drops to 40-30 FPS. Definitely needs a performance patch.Story: 7/10The game does a great job of unfolding each chapter, but there are two major issues. After each chapter, you get a cutscene—either a pre-story, post-story, or just something related to the current chapter. Honestly, I didn’t understand most of these scenes. Only a few made sense after completing levels 100% and facing all the bosses. This is a major drawback. It would make more sense if these cutscenes explained the situation in a new location or provided context for the final boss. As it stands, they’re cool with great music but lack clear meaning. The backstory of our main character is also unclear, leaving me confused about why we're traveling to these places, who sent us, and how they knew about them.Narrative: 8/10The game does a fantastic job encouraging exploration to find side bosses and quests. There are no ""Go here"" markers—you have to explore the entire map and search. However, some side quests and their related items are insanely difficult to figure out. I’m not stupid; it’s just genuinely hard to connect the dots. Like, why break a wall in a different location to retrieve an item for a side quest? And what’s with the boots to unlock a secret boss location? But on the plus side, it’s cool that they didn’t forget about the other locations—you’re forced to revisit them to complete side quests. By the penultimate chapter, I was worn out and just wanted to reach the end.Boss Fights: 8/10Some of these fights are brutal, but still enjoyable. I’m knocking off one point for the dodging bugs (getting hit by a barrage of snowballs despite trying to dodge is frustrating as hell) and for bosses with long, multi-hit combos that leave you with a tiny window to counterattack. I lost to one boss three times when they had just 3-4% HP left, simply because I couldn’t get close enough between dodges. Another point off for the boss that teleports to another realm when it’s down to 20% HP and drains 70% of your stamina. I don’t know how others got through this, but I spent 3-4 hours and around 200 attempts before resorting to a trainer to finally beat it. Afterward, I uninstalled the trainer and continued playing. Fun fact: in the next chapter, I only died three times on the final boss, and the rest I managed to defeat on the first try. The final boss of the game is also tough, with 10-hit combos, but it's doable—took me three hours and a few million nerve cells to finally finish the game.Localization: 5/10The localization feels like it was translated via ChatGPT and then slightly edited by freelancers. Why is “Wukong” pronounced ""Wukong"" in the English subtitles, but ""Укон"" in Russian? For half the game, I thought “Укон” was some master who created “Wukong.” The translation is frustratingly bad, especially after discovering the correct names and terms on an English YouTube video. Another example: when a character says, ""Give him a chance at mercy,"" the Russian subtitles translate it as ""Дайте ему шанс дальше жить,"" which isn’t quite the same. There are many such moments where the English dialogue sounds wise, but the Russian version is clumsily translated, making it seem much less impactful."
Positive,Beautiful game and great boss fights.Story is fine if you've read the novel.Map guidance is trash.
Positive,"CINEMA,  200$ 300$ 500$ for the dlc? ill buy it no matter what"
Positive,"I was on the fence about getting this game because I had never gotten into a Souls-like game before, thinking they were too difficult. For someone like me, this is definitely Souls-esque, but not too bad. The main issue is overcoming panic dodging and understanding the key elements to combat, such as building focus, when to use light and heavy attacks, setting up a proper build for said attacks, and general situational awareness. With time, you start to understand that dying is inevitable the first time you play in order to understand enemy mechanics. It is rough playing at first with lack of abilities, but once you get more and get stronger, it becomes a lot more fun. When you first start, I would highly recommend focusing on leveling up Robust Constitution and Rampant Vigor since they increase health and stamina. This will make things a little easier. There is no cost to resetting your build points, so you can play with different builds and see what works best for you.Overall, the game is beautiful, the combat is a fun hack and slash, the characters are interesting, and there is great satisfaction with leveling up Sun WuKong and getting new weapons and armor."
Positive,Game sooooooo gud blud
Positive,"Monkey see monkey do, monkey pee all over you"
Positive,"there is issues but is an amazing game,i got called filthy monke by some furries in the mountains"

Positive,"Best game ever!! IMO, the graphics surpass all the game I have ever played! Each viewpoint and fight scene looks absolutely astonishing and satisfying to me! The way players can fly in last chapter is like OMG! This is not only a game but also a piece of art!"
Positive,a good game that you can tell was made with love and passion. very fun!
Positive,This is very fun game I love very much (except when boss too hard for me)
Positive,Hell Yeah... 10.000 times hell yeah!
Positive,"Great game, amazing cinematic experience. Not too challenging to finish the story, but the 100% was a decent challenge."
Positive,monke with stick. what more want?
Positive,Amazing souls like game with amazing graphics. the amount of unique enemies and bosses in this game makes it very enjoyable to play! 10/10 this game is incredible
Positive,This game truly makes you feel like a monke with stick.- I was happy being a monke- I got greedy for power as a monke- Defeated many foes and explored a lot of regions as a monke- I am now sad as a monkeIs this how Wukong truly felt in the end...?
Positive,"It's true that putting all your faith in Black Myth: Wukong is not wrong. I remember when Black Myth: Wukong first debuted, I said wow, sooner or later Black Myth: Wukong will do great things. Again, I feel nostalgic, it looks like it's been 20 years together, right?No matter what the result is today, my trust in Black Myth: Wukong will not change, just like when I was with the team 20 years ago when the team had nothing.Thanks Google Translate!!!"
Positive,monke stonk together
Positive,10/10 outstanding game of the year
Positive,"""Por que você me ajudou?""""Hmm, macaco"""
Positive,"I have enjoyed the gameplay and the storyline. Im not all the way done but having a great time so far.  Not as unforgiving as souls like games are with losing of exp on death,  Most bosses have shrines nearby to teleport to. Lots of area to explore and secrets to find."
Positive,"Easily winning Goty and also this isnt a soul like game its more of a boss rush game cause every second im fighting a mini boss or a boss but when u beat them u get rewarded a lot. The combat system is nice and you can tell it took insipiration from many games, I think this is an amazing game and worth the 90 dollars I had to pay.."
Positive,"previously I kinda pessimistic because the benchmark demo is kinda underwhelming and the graphic wasn't looks that good, but after knowing the ""Anti-Woke"" thing about the game, without a second thought I buy the game :)"
Positive,black myth wukong prepare to die edition 9.5/10
Positive,Sekiro + God of War
Positive,"I honestly cannot remember the last time a game actually delivered upon, let alone even exceeded the expectations set by trailers and the likes.The combat is engaging, smooth and diverse, unlockable skills are unique and can be respecced at any time, and - to address the elephant, or should I say, gorilla in the room - yes, the game does look as stunning as in the trailers.It quite astonishingly does so while running satisfyingly smooth - yes, an UE5 game with insane graphics having solid 60 AT LAUNCH!Though that is not to say the game wouldn't be demanding - if you want to max out all the settings with Raytracing and all at 4K, you should make sure you got a 4090 or two setting your room (and wallet) ablaze. Personally, I'm running this on an overclocked 3080 10Gb and after playing around with the settings in their free to download benchmark tool I managed to get consistent 60fps while still enjoying those stunning graphics.The only minor hiccup I encountered so far was 2 or 3 textures not loading in high-res for a few seconds during a cutscene, though that did not break my immersion.The bosses, there being 91 of them, are also unique, intricately designed and quite challenging. I did encounter 2 'copies' so far, though they still had some unique differences to their respective counterparts.The level design is good as well - you do not get an open world to roam around in and generally the game is designed to be rather linear, but you do get several different paths you can take, as well as some secret areas, so you can still put in some time exploring.The only critique I have in that regard is that there are a lot of invisible walls. I understand that you don't want players to get lost in empty areas or fall down a cliff, but instead of plastering the levels with invisible walls you could just design them in such a way that it is visually clear that you cannot go that way. As for the cliffs I think the choice to make the ""Destined One"" tumble a bit at the edge as he does in the game is a great design choice though.As for the story (I promise this is the last point I want to address), it is very intriguing as well, especially it being connected to the old Chinese Novel ""Journey to the West"". I also like that it actually has a story rather than just lore you have to piece together yourself. I can't say much more about it as I only just finished the first chapter and also do not want to spoil it, but so far it is pretty thrilling.All in all, Black Myth Wukong is an amazing game - especially in times like these with predatory microtransactions and rushed releases, as well as this coming from a new Chinese studio that only did mobile games before.Game Science also mentioned they want to expand upon their 'Black Myth' franchise and create more games revolving around Chinese folklore and I can't wait to see what else they got up their sleeves.But for now, I'm going to enjoy playing through the tales of Sun Wukong and I can assure you that you will too."
Positive,Silly Monkey :)
Positive,SUCK IT IGN and Sweet Baby Inc.  Fuck You
Positive,"It's a more challenging game than I thought it would be, and the combat makes you think about every button press so button mashing doesn't work here. Thoroughly enjoying my time with Wukong and would recommend it to anyone on the fence."
Positive,Los valores de producción de este juego son algo demencial. Es GOTY sin duda alguna. Una maravilla que no me cansaré de recomendar.
Positive,monke have stick monke happy

Positive,"I was never interested in chinese Mythology but i still got the game because it looked good.Boy was i surprised, the game is actually insanely good, the combat feels great, the graphics are incredible and the story was interesting and visually crazy good as well.The combat is definetly on the harder side. In the beginning you get a few spells and abilitys and the first bosses should be beatable by most people, i was worried that the game might even be too easy because the abilitys your character gets are all pretty good, literally stopping the enemy in his tracks, summoning clones etc.Turns out my worry was unfounded, the game ramps up the difficulty towards the end quite a bit and i was sweating with some of them, which i did like a lot, but people not used to difficult games might have a hard time with that.The game kinda forces you to get better/be good enough to beat the boss or you just wont get further in the story, which might turn off some people who become too frustrated.As someone who plays a lot of Elden Ring / Souls games in general i would rate this game on the ""easier"" side of difficult games, but it is still difficult and you get little help through something like say spirit summons in Elden Ring, some fights give you a lil help but most dont, its you and them.The visuals look amazing throughout the entire game and it has surprisingly a lot of cutscenes, but it never felt too much. They felt more like a reward for progressing the story/reaching, beating difficult bosses, then something annoying that explains every little thing you find and which just waste your time. Its hard to explain but i felt the pacing between cutscenes and actually playing was really well done!The one thing i have to complain about is the lack of minimap, the game feels very open but it is actually quite linear and paths that look passable are actually not and blocked by invisible walls.I found that very annoying and at some point i didnt actively try to explore anymore, i just took whatever i found obvious and probably left quite a few things out.Having a minimap that just shows where theres a dead end would definetly help in that regards. No need for arrows that point you somewhere or ""quest logs"", just for the terrain would be plenty.Overall i did enjoy this game a lot. Qualitywise it definetly plays in the same league as something like Elden Ring.There are no microtransactions or hidden content or whatever other bs modern developers like to put out as well just to cash in a little more, you buy the game, you have the game.Its also more of a one and done kind of game, you have one playstyle and your standard moveset is more or less the same, so you cant redo the game with another weapon/build for example, similar to Sekiro in that regards. There are some customizations but nothing that really changes the way you play the game."
Positive,"Ok so I will try to keep it spoiler free. I have finished the first act and so far it has been quite a wild ride.1) The story is kinda hard to grasp in the beginning, but I think on a repeat playthrough it will all make sense. But the cinematics are amazing and the story is fun to watch as a movie even.2) Visuals, I am playing on a RTX 2060 Super -> Most settings except the textures on medium. Texture is at cinematic. Game runs at a smooth 80 - 75 frames most places except for where a mid boss comes. There, after I defeated the boss, the frames dropped to around 25 for half a minute. As far as I have played there are no crashes or bugs.3) Exploration, I was expecting a very linear game and for the most part it is, but in the first act, they still managed to hide a lot of stuff. Repeat playthroughs will clean that up. Game consists of pretty much a linear level you go through with smaller open worlds (2 paths) at the end of which, you either encounter a mini boss or some treasure.  4)  Enemy variety - This is very good. The game deceives you in the beginning by showing around 25 total enemies to fight. But that is just for the First act. As I logged into act 2, more enemies became revealed to me. The stories these enemy descriptions contain are very cool because they build the world and the characters are often related to the current act.5) Bosses and minibosses - I was really impressed with all the bosses I encountered so far. There is obviously the plain attack moves, but then there are some additional follow-ups the bosses did that often caught me off guard. Over all I had difficulty telling which is a side boss and which is a main boss, all the bosses are done so well.6) Combat - I feel combat was kinda sticky... I think its because I am comparing it to NIOH 2 combat, but overall I think each move has a animation and you cannot break out of the animation (most of the time) with dodges. I got some hit registration issues as well, but as I continued to play it, I felt it clicked and mid way it started to feel good, not NIOH good, but good. I think the skill tree is kinda lacking, but most things in the skill tree have a purpose, but the supplementary stuff like magic and transformations make it quite fun overall, as you unlock enemy moves and other stuff. 7) Progression - Game kept dropping little tid-bits of progression throughout the first act, so it was fun, but I think at this point it will starting dropping enemy skills and new transformations as we progress through act 2.8) Difficulty - Not very difficult at all, except for the first part, I got through most bosses in 5 or 6 attempts max. The good thing is the bosses are not damage sponges and you and the boss are squishy equally.9) Wokeness level - Monke/10Fun Factor - I played 6 hours in one day after purchasing the game, the story element and the cut scene. The game is fun but I feel binging more than 2 or 3 hours at a time. Combat is fun once you get the hang of it, it is kinda slower and more tactical like the souls games. Enemies are cool. Story seems good. Voice acting is workable. Cutscenes are great. This is basically a pure action game, you dont really need to put much brain into it. Cuz you, me are monke. Monke want to smash stuff with stic"
Positive,"Monke game good, get monke game.I got it free for getting an RTX 4080, but jokes aside the game is phenomenal."
Positive,i could spread my cheeks its so good
Positive,"If you watched Journey to the west cartoons growing up, you're gonna love this. Solid game all around."
Positive,"Enjoying this game. Extremely fun. Not easy, not hard either and every boss in the game has unique mechanics. Money spent well."
Positive,40 hours played. This game is awesome.
Positive,"BRIEF REVIEW OF BLACK MYTH WUKONGComplete the game, and i would like to briefly review the game as follows:- Beautiful graphics, extremely meticulous sound and environment design- Extremely satisfying combat, with many skill branches for us to choose from- Extremely diverse monsters, bosses are also well designed with many diverse movesets and high difficulty- Engaging storyline, described in many interesting waysMinus points: temporarily can't think of any because I'm playing quite well :3>>> The game is extremely worth playing and worth buying at the moment, I just thought I would buy it for Wukong, but I didn't expect the game to do so well :v"
Positive,"Awesome, well polished, super smooth. Difficulty is very well balanced, it does not feel too easy or too hard.Sort of linear for now but with optional areas and bosses that reward exploration.Do not forget to install on SSD."
Positive,I am not a single player gamer I very rarely play or even recommend single player games I always get bored so quickly but this game is just amazing! I love the story and the battles are intense and spectacular! Honestly a must play game!
Positive,"Not really souls like! Its like ""God Of War"" and ""Devil May Cry"" had a baby and Sekiro taught it in grade school"
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong immerses players in a captivating adventure inspired by the timeless Chinese saga, Journey to the West. As Sun Wukong, the legendary Monkey King, you embark on a quest that transcends mere gaming—it becomes an odyssey. The game’s visuals are nothing short of breathtaking. From mist-shrouded peaks to intricately designed temples, each environment feels meticulously crafted. Sun Wukong himself is a visual marvel, blending power and vulnerability in equal measure.Drawing inspiration from the “souls-like” genre, Black Myth Wukong introduces a combat system that strikes a harmonious balance. Fans of the God of War series will appreciate its visceral impact. Yet, Wukong’s staff-fueled combos and special moves add a fresh layer of depth.Unlike traditional souls-like games, Black Myth Wukong doesn’t shy away from empowering players. A rich array of abilities enhances boss encounters and overall gameplay. Each battle becomes a puzzle, demanding precise timing and strategic thinking. The narrative weaves threads of Chinese mythology into a compelling tapestry. In Conclusion, Black Myth Wukong isn’t merely a game; it’s an exploration of ancient Chinese legends. Whether you’re a devotee of Chinese mythology or simply seek an unforgettable action-adventure experience, this title delivers."

Positive,great game but will probably get the Hogwarts Legacy treatment and not even get considered for game of the year because Jeff Keighley is a woke sjw. This game feels less like a souls like and more like Onimusha or Nioh and that is not a bad thing. Give it a try and you will not regret it.
Positive,Well im black so does that make me a Chinese man? you cant make fun of me now :]

Positive,"As of writing this review I don't have many hours but I can say confidently that this a game that is worth its price tag. Everything from character design, environment, combat mechanics, cut scenes, sound and voice acting (especially in Chinese) is masterfully delivered in this Chinese Mythology game. I'm glad the studio was able to deliver such high quality game that gives a run for its western counterparts. I'm hoping this game is the start of a very healthy competition between game-makers to deliver the best they can, would recommend 10/10."
Positive,Monkey with big stick
Positive,Monke with a stick go bonk bonk 10.6/10
Positive,I am only on the first chapter but I am liking it. It is a breath of fresh air. Works flawless on Linux using Proton 9.0-2. I am running PopOS! 22.04.
Positive,a definite game of the year. no dispute.
Positive,"Full game, no in game shop, great bosses, no bugs ( what ive noticed ), simply amazing."
Positive,"man i really want to play this game but i am a casual and getting through the bosses is killing my desire to play.. Looks great, initially is quite fun but i am too old and slow to get far. is a bummer I wanted to see how it goes. Refunded because i am not good enough to play"
Positive,"Game Of The Year material easily. A good single player with a fantastic combat system after soo long. Many people say its soulslike, but its a mix of both. Its rewarding and the boss fights are memorial af. If you are feeling it difficult, then youre just not using all the skills provided to you. Get the game if you can, you wont regret it."
Positive,"Amazing game, I think it's the best graphics I've seen in a game until now.It's a souls like game in a good way, slightly easier than the classics (but not by a lot), challenging and rewarding, kind of feels like a ""Sekiro 2"".Totally would recommend to anyone."
Positive,Monke strong but then monke weak but then monke strong again.
Positive,37 mins in and it's already EPIC! Visually stunning and the game play is smooth as fruit in a blender.
Positive,"In chapter 2 now and I am having an absolute blast. Very fun game with LOTS of cool unique bosses. Although, that tends to be its shortcoming too as the things in between the bosses are... less than spectacular... Those sections needed a lot more work. Still, overall, up till now, that hasn't really made my overall experience any less fun. Eager to go in for more.As for performance, it is running fine. Using the settings by Hardware Unboxed, I am getting nearly 60 FPS on average. It keeps fluctuating between 57-60. THere have been no crashes and I experienced a major FPS drop only once (unfortunately during a boss fight). My System specs for your references - CPU - Ryzen 7 5700xGPU - ASrock RX 7800 XTRAM - 16GBHope this helps"

Positive,this game is fvcking great
Positive,"Best game if you're a fan of Journey to the West.The game get better and better every new chapter.English subs is bad, in my country we use AI translated mods to understand fully what the dev is telling."
Positive,"Great game - outstanding graphics, solid controls and interesting lore. Unfortunately it's way too hard for me to really enjoy it fully... They should have included a noob-option for old gamers like me. I played through all Dark Souls games, but surprisingly found this even harder, dunno. ;)"
Positive,"You know that feeling when you played GoW, and wished all the annoying puzzles were not there. This game focuses on combat and it does that pretty good. None of the places felt repetitive and some of the bosses took me 10+ tries but they never felt unfair. Love the different way of storing telling than traditional games. Although graphic performance is bad, I was playing on RTX 4080 super on high settings, there were stutters while entering new areas but during combat I got consistent FPS.Overall love the game, will probably going to do 2-3 more runs with different builds. Peace!"
Positive,"Words cannot express how gorgeous and extensive in content this game is. Four years worth of waiting. It is incredible. For me, this is easily the Game of the Year. Thank You Game Science for this GEM.Extremely pleased with this game's success"
Positive,"WOW...this game is freakin awesome. I didnt know if i was going to like it, because i usually dont like the games that most of the mob likes, but i do on this one. On the RTX 3060 im running very high textures and everything else high, with DLSS on 70 and in 1080p, and im getting well over 60 fps most of the time. The game is also a lot more forgiving than elden ring, and not as hard, but it feels very rewarding beating bosses and leveling up. im also glad this game studio didnt bow to the woke mob..."
Positive,Juat take my money
Positive,"This is a fantastic game that will defiantly be Game of the Year worthy (if that still means anything these days). This game is packed with lots of Chinese mythology and lore that makes me want to look up and read Journey to the West and learn more about Sun Wukong and the people he meets. Also Journey to the West is what inspired Akira Toriyama to create world of Dragon Ball which makes me love this game even more. If you like Soulsborne type games or the new God of War games then you'll have fun with this game and it's combat/mechanics. Also the graphics and designs of the characters and the world are beautiful to look at. Don't listen to what those ""critics"" or ""journalist"" have to say they don't matter and they don't even enjoy playing games. Listen to other people who have played and reviewed the game, do some research on the game and then judge whether or not this game is worth your time. Thanks to Game Science for making such an awesome game on a character that was the inspiration to the creation of Son Goku, one of my favorite anime characters."

Positive,A perfect mix between Souls & God of War
Positive,They outdid themselvesSmall company phenomenal game80lbs benching 350 they deserve all praise
Positive,"Finished both endings and fought all bosses the game has to offer with about 80% achievements. The game is great, but it needs to be harder.There is only a handful of challenging bosses out of the 100+ the game has. Easy bosses have great design and attack patterns for the 30-60 seconds that they were alive. Truly a waste of potential. Of course you can artificially increase the difficulty by restricting yourself to ""no transformations"" or ""no spells"", but it takes the fun away.I thought that NG+ would offer a harder difficulty, but it is more of the opposite. You return to the starting place being incredibly overpowered. The game has no replayability, other than going back to areas where you missed out on irreversible events during the first playthrough. (which is a waste of time as I'd rather watch YouTube than having to repeat the entire campaign)Still going to recommend this game because it was fun for the 60 hours i played it. It is also rather unfair to expect a story game to have that much replayability."
Positive,幸得大圣借佛力，邪风一时偃旌旗To Game Science
Positive,Peak gaming. MONKE FTW!
Positive,"Definitely needs to be patched, other than that, it is a gorgeous game! <3"
Positive,"Very fun, challenging but never too difficult. Lots of secrets to discover while exploring the worldedit: This shit fucking hard, the secret boss for the secret ending makes me want to jump into a flaming building. still fun tho"
Positive,monke game good me happy
Positive,"Great game, but don't know shit about wukong"
Positive,BEST GAME EVER FOR SURE
Positive,Game is really fun and engaging. Harambe Simulator 2024!
Positive,one with the monke
Positive,really tickles my pickle
Positive,"As a person who don't prefer soulslike games and have never played souls/eldenring, it was still overwhelmingly good.The graphics, music, plot is on point.Absolutely recommend it"
Positive,"Great game. Fascinating fighting system and image qualities. Diverse boss features. Extremely beautiful oriental artistic conception.Cons: no maps, easy to get lost and no idea where to go(lack of guiding points)  Too many coarsely-designed air walls"
Positive,"dying simulator, much recommended!"
Positive,The dialogue is peak
Positive,"Good until the Prison in Chapter 3, Ridiculous"
Positive,Im surprised and very impressed. Masterpiece and GOTY worthy.
Positive,10/10 BEST GAME EVER!
Positive,Goku is pretty cool in this game
Positive,very nice wa wa whoo wee
Positive,"This game is absolutely and genuiely HEAT if you couldn't tell by the opening boss cinematic. Just finished chapter 3 and the ending boss is absolutely amazing alongside the crazy cinematic that follows it. I dare say this game is up there alongside Dark souls if not even better. It's annoying to keep hearing people and reviewers call this game ""souls-like"". It's NOT, there is no punishment for dying, the game doesn't do you bogus with reskinned bosses or plain unnecessary level design. The movement is responsive, stacking abilities goes crazy and the boss fights so far are absolutely excellent."
Positive,Very good game it's the best game I played in 2024 so far  10/10
Positive,i love it
Positive,"Most stress-free action RPG. The way every time you think ""man I wish I had-"" game immediately hands it to you, it almost feels like monkey paw curling with no downside."
Positive,"The game is simply phenomenon for a first AAA game coming out from a new face in the industry and from China as well. Especially as someone who is Chinese ethnic from Singapore, we are well verse with Journey to the West and Monkey King, and this tick all the right boxes with me, great game mechanics, great graphics, awesome animations included at the end of the chapters, the story, the dialogues, almost non-existent bugs for me, attention to details where there's no reused assets as compared to other known AAA studios.I can't wait to see what other Chinese mythology/folklore they will bring in the next game!"
Positive,Good Monkey Game!!!! 100000/100000!!! Game of the Year for sure!!!
Positive,LOVE THE GAME
Positive,"I’ve only been playing this game for a few hours, and so far I can honestly say that this game has a HUGE potential to become a great franchise. So many cool abilities and spirits you can use and the bosses themselves are not too difficult, and it’s very forgiving. With that being said, the graphics on this game are really good, which is expected since the game is UE5. However, UE5 always comes with a performance cost. This game is extremely demanding and will require you to turn down a few settings to medium-low depending on your specs. So far this game is worth the money and I am excited to see what the devs do next!"
Positive,amazing game. graphics are insane and the fighting is top tier. might be game of the year
Positive,"Good game, good monkey, good baldy. 10/10"
Positive,Best Action Game Ever!
Positive,"This is what you get when you leave the greedy attitude and the politics aside and focus on your product. TOTAL SUCCESS ! This game is an absolute blast,It’s like stepping into a living, breathing painting.The combat system is so smooth, blending the perfect mix of strategy and fast-paced action.I love it , 2.5M other gamers loved it , easy one of my favorite gaming experiences of the year.Let this be a lesson for the other publishers on how to make a AAA game, make a load of money and ""force"" the community to praise you at the same time! For me , this is a TAKE MY MONEY title."
Positive,Big Monkey Daddy is back
Positive,editing this cause this game actually fucks its dope
Positive,"Amazing game, Beautiful graphics, Honestly can't recommend enough. It's a top level game on par with any souls game out there."
Positive,I love being a barefoot monkey man. And I love china!
Positive,work of art
Positive,"Graphics and soundtracks are amazing!! Game play and story line are so good that i'm afraid of finishing the game. I think of this game when i play other games and it's so hard to stop playing, that's how good this game is."
Positive,GET THIS SHIT
Positive,"Way better than what i was expecting, i'm mostly skeptical when it comes to buying games on release since most games nowadays feels like a cheap overhyped cash-grab. In this case it was not, you can clearly see all the effort put into this game, although i know nothing about the Journey to the West story the game wasn't really confusing and i could grasp most of what was going on. My only complaint is the amount of invisible walls that are placed everywhere, it feels cheap and robs my sense of the big scale of the atmosphere, sometimes when i want to just jump over a big placed rock in the middle of the map i can't because it has an invisible barrier. Other than that the rest of the game is mostly perfect. Currently i'm in the middle of Chapter 2 so i'll see how the rest of the game plays."
Positive,brilliant game :)
Positive,if this isnt goty 2024 gaming is COOKED
Positive,"I play monkey, I become monkey"

Positive,Eat your heart out Elden Ring

Positive,1 million concurrent players in Steam as of writing.. Apes Together Strong
Positive,Game of the year for sure guys!!!!!!
Positive,I cant beat the first boss im trash
Positive,Do I think this game is good? Yes.Would I recommend this game? Somewhat.Do I think this game is as amazing as a lot of people make it out to be? Oh hell no! It is way overhyped!In all honesty the game gets carried hard by its looks and sound. The core gameplay is fine but not something I haven´t seen before nor the best iteration of what it does. It is very much a game that targets a more casual and graphics driven audience.
Positive,"What an AAA game release should look like.The game is polished, no bugs so far, optimisation is good (Note: I have an Nvidia GPU, AMD users apparently reported some problems, so if you have one look into it), the gameplay is unique and flows very well, combat is satisfying and challenging... The breathtaking visuals are just the cherry on top.The studio focused on making a good game instead of a good monetisation system. No in-game microtransaction, no quest locked behind a 100€ edition... It's not a revolution in the gaming world (apart from graphics maybe). It is 'just' a very good game. And that's perfectly fine."
Positive,🙈 🙉 🐵 GOTY!
Positive,Game good.  Monkey good.  Monkey game.... life good.
Positive,funny monkey + bonk stick = good 👍
Positive,Game of the year.
Positive,"""eeek eeek oooo-aaaa oooo-aaaa""me after playing wukong ....... Shity Optmization in last chapter"
Positive,"visually stunning, story is good, combat is okay."
Positive,my master... safethe scriptures... soundthe banana... yellow
Positive,besides some of the fighting mechanics being absolutely atrocious(bosses locking on to you no matter what even changing their path mid air just to hit you) its an amazing game edit: on chapter 4 now and yea the boss fights are so bad its really the only bad part to the game the devs really botched the mechanics
Positive,"9/10. All achievements unlocked, completed on the second playthrough. Setting aside the fact that it's the first  AAA Chinese game, this is one of the best titles I've played in recent years. The point deduction is due to a few issues: certain boss hitboxes could be optimized, Chapter 5 could use some more content, and there are many empty areas in Bishui Cave that feel rushed and underdeveloped. Looking forward to the DLC, especially save  the Fourth Sister and fight my way  from Nantian Gate to Lingxiao Palace."
Positive,I LIKE MONKE
Positive,Good game. but too short and way too easy. needs an inferno mode badly. get this on a sale but not at full price.
Positive,"Reject humanity, embrace monke!"
Positive,monkey go bonk
Positive,W monkey game
Positive,Going Apeshit playing this masterpiece 10/10.
Positive,Good game im enjoying it but im currently in one of the secret boss fights. when i entered to the to area my whole screen is white i cant see nothing its like a constant flashbang on my screen when i beat the boss it goes away. does anyone know how to fix that its getting annoying to beat them like that and not enjoy the game
Positive,"Soooooo... I had been very excited for this game. Followed it from the day of announcement. Here are few things I have observed in my journey of getting this game run on my RIG (in short - i9 14900k/ RTX 4090/ 64GB DDR5 6000 CL30/ MSI Carbon z790 wifi 7 II) - all in all, its a no compromise rig.** FIRST TIME INSTALLATION **Pre Checks I did :  - All drivers updated - Updated my bios - Checked my paging memory size and any interrupting processes - Made sure redundant services are not runningRESULTS - * Game gets closed on shaders loading @1.2% with out of video memory errorI rolled back my drivers and tested with everything, and still the issue. Re-installed  my windows as well with a complete clean installation.?? HOW DID I FIX this????Checked and reconfirmed by CPU power settings. Power settings were defined in the mobo based on my water cooling option due to the AIO I have.Quickly change your cooling config for CPU in Motherboard bios to Boxed cooler - Ultimately limiting your TDP usage 240W (Also found out that the alleged microcode fix in the latest bios update has nothing to do with it, this CPU is simply not meant to run on high voltages - scammed by intel, I will change my processor next year). This will work for every 13th/14th Gen intel processor, for AMD processors, you may have to refer another guide.BOTTOMLINE - Your CPU is the culprit - dont blame the game yet, I will come to that :P WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?- I made sure in windows settings under Displayu and graphics that the Wukong appliocation was using my dedicated GFX card- Ran the game normally and it worked.ANDDDDD . . . I was blown away by the graphics, I am telling you, the days of ""Can it run Crysis?"" is gone. We shall now ask, ""Can it run MONKEY?""So, On 4K native resolution, With DLAA on 90 resolution sampling with Full RT ON and Cinematics preset - RTX 4090/i9 14900k- Average FPS = 68- Maximum FPS = 87- Lowest FPS = 48Observations in Gameplay - **Pretty Fast paced**Great Opening Cut**Gameplay is a scaled down souls mated with sekiro and Nioh - but still fun**Keyboard bindings are a pain, I would suggest using controller, but, using mouse kinda shows how visual artifacts and tearing happen on different fidelity presets** English DUB feels funny, I prefer original soundtrack with subtitles - gives you a better feel of the character.THE MOST IMPORTANT VERDICT - Would I spend my time in completing this 100%?ABSOLUTELY YES!!!!!If you can go through the starting huddle of making the game run, you are in for a treat. Kudos to the developers, your hardwork shows.One Note For the Developers - THE GAME CAN STILL USE A LOT OF OPTIMIZATION, WITH RESPECT TO GRAPHIC SETTINGS AND HOW DIFFERENT VALUES REALISTICALLY CHANGE THE PERFORMANCE. PLEASE OPTIMIZE SOON, YOU HAVE A GREAT GAME, PLEASE ENABLE MAXIMUM GAMERS TO ENJOY THIS MASTERPIECE!!"
Positive,"Nothing much to say, just trust the player base and try it out yourself. Many Chinese single player games may have had very poor reputations but this, this changes everything"
Positive,"If you enjoyed Elden Ring you will most likely love this game. Its really refreshing to play a game which focuses on content above all else. Breathtaking graphics, fun mechanics, engaging story. I recommend this game 10/10."
Positive,I like this game because it makes numbers and letters people angry

Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong - Monkey Business Done Right!”Rating: ★★★★☆If you’ve ever wondered what would happen if you crossed the mythical might of Sun Wukong with a video game’s graphical fidelity, prepare yourself for Black Myth: Wukong. This game is like if Dragon Ball Z and Dark Souls had a baby, and that baby grew up to be a kung fu master with an amazing sense of style.From the moment you start the game, it’s clear that this isn’t just another monkey business. The developers have clearly put their hearts into this, giving us a world so lush and detailed, you might start thinking your TV has developed a new life of its own. The landscapes are so vivid that you’ll find yourself wondering if you should have packed a lunch before setting off on your epic adventure.Let’s talk about the combat. Wukong swings his staff with such finesse that you might expect it to start breaking out into a dance routine. The fluidity of movement and the satisfying thunk of each hit makes you feel like a true warrior—until you realize you’ve been stuck on the same boss for the past hour. Then, you might feel more like a warrior who forgot to read the instruction manual.Speaking of bosses, they’re about as forgiving as a tax auditor. Each fight feels like a test of patience and skill, but also a test of your ability to stay calm while your controller is in danger of becoming a flying object. But when you finally beat one, the sense of accomplishment is so sweet that you’ll want to take a victory lap around your living room.The storyline, based on the classic Chinese tale, is woven together with such attention to detail that you might start Googling ancient legends during your lunch breaks. And the voice acting? Let’s just say if you’re looking for a game to immerse yourself in, this one could give you a PhD in mythical lore.In summary, Black Myth: Wukong is a fantastic ride through a world of mythical majesty and relentless challenges. It’s like having a front-row seat to the ultimate fantasy kung fu movie, where you’re the star—and also, occasionally, the person who throws the popcorn because you’re losing your mind over a particularly tough boss.Just remember: if you can’t find your way through the game, don’t worry. It’s probably just a cleverly disguised treasure chest—or a very cleverly disguised wall. Happy adventuring!"
Positive,China..... numba 1!!!
Positive,"PROS:    Incredible ground-breaking graphics.    Amazing sound design.    One of the coolest intros to a game ever.     One of the most accessible Souls-like games on the market; Wukong does not go out of its way to punish players initially, opting instead to ease them into challenging encounters.    Fast, fluid combat and highly responsible dodging mechanics. None of that clunky, awkward, slow BS typical of the genre.    Gameplay-first approach; story and cutscenes don't impede momentum of game.    Jam-packed with intense, interesting boss fights (although quality varies of course).   Players do not lose credits, items, XP, etc... upon death. I personally welcome this decision, as it reduces unnecessary stress and encourages aggression and experimentation. You will die A LOT, but the game won't sadistically punish you for it.  CONS:    Way too linear. Despite rich and stunning environments, players aren't able to explore and are constricted to narrow paths. The amount of shoddy invisible walls you run into is shocking, especially for a 2024 title. For comparison, Sekiro had more open environments.     No verticality. You play as literal god-monkey and cannot scale trees, jump off of objects, etc.    Relatively limited weapon and gear sets. This is NOT Elden Ring.      Lack of innovation. This game doesn't bring anything new to the Souls-like or Souls-lite genre. The game mechanics are well-worn at this point.I would recommend Black Myth: Wukong to players who want to dip their toes into the Soulsborne genre but are a bit too intimidated by titles like Sekiro. For hardened Souls fans, Wukong's difficulty curve might be a bit underwhelming. All in all a solid game, although I'm a little disappointed players are still easily dazzled and pacified by graphics instead of demanding innovation within the genre."
Positive,Amazing game. If you like games like god of war or devil may cry you will love it. And also visually gorgeous.
Positive,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a breathtaking experience that takes players deep into the rich and mystical world inspired by the classic Chinese tale, ""Journey to the West."" The game is a visual masterpiece, boasting stunning graphics and detailed character designs that bring ancient China to life with a unique blend of realism and fantasy.The combat system is incredibly engaging and offers a perfect balance between strategy and action. Each battle feels intense and rewarding, requiring players to think on their feet and master the diverse set of skills and abilities that the Monkey King possesses. The seamless integration of mythological elements with gameplay mechanics adds a fresh and captivating twist to the action RPG genre.One of the standout features of ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is its immersive storytelling. The narrative is deeply rooted in Chinese mythology, and it is beautifully woven into the game, allowing players to explore a world filled with legendary creatures, powerful deities, and compelling lore. The voice acting and musical score further enhance the atmosphere, making the world feel alive and dynamic.Overall, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a must-play for fans of action RPGs and anyone looking for a game that combines spectacular visuals, deep storytelling, and challenging gameplay. It’s a groundbreaking title that sets a new standard for the genre and is a fantastic homage to one of China's most beloved legends."
Positive,I'm really excited to finally see this game out here.
Positive,great game ... no micro transaction ...no politicaL BULLSHIT .... PURE VISUAL TREAT ..... ENJOYING
Positive,Beautiful graphic and great story.
Positive,"Great game to playHoweverYou probably already know this but it's gonna fuck yo shit upUpdate your drivers, clear shader caches, optimize your settings, do whatever you can to get this mf runningAnd if you can't, you should probably wait or refund itIf you can though, great game"
Positive,"This is probably the most beautiful game I've ever played. Graphic is outstanding, combat is super fun, game is running smooth. But I do wish you guys can add a map system into the game, at least make it optional for us. That'd be awesome!"
Positive,"After 10hours. I have a few words to share.Pros:- The game looks cannot be more beautiful- Attack and combo mechanic depends on 3 staff stands, make it more variety to do combos.- Boss moveset is either challenging or not. Fit well for non-soullike player- Music is great and nostalgic for Asian like me.Cons:- Camera lock-on at body, make it difficult to fight the large boss.- RTX3070 really tired to catchup with 4K med res. (no RT)- No map and no guide to what to do- Boss fight simulator. There are no area to explore that don't have any creep to fight with- Dumbass crossbow rats"
Positive,"This has to be one of the greatest games I've consumed in a long time. The environments are so unfathomably beautiful, the boss fights are INSANE as well as the cinematics within them, they will make you think that even a little field enemy is super cool. The character design on enemies and npcs are beautiful and some ugly as they're supposed to be. The journey this game takes you through is insane. The quests are pretty self explanatory too which coming from a souls player, I love. The amount of times I was at the edge of my seat during a boss fight barely winning is too many to count haha. This game is just a masterpiece, I could ramble on and on. If you are thinking about getting it you should!"
Positive,"1st  time play this type of game, I feel very nice game and worth"
Positive,Finally a good game
Positive,Game of the Year

Positive,Why do I recommend this game?1. You get to play as a variant of Monkey King. One of the best mythological characters out there.2. You get to bonk monsters3. The bonks at times give out the satisfying metal clink soundAnd the best of all....NO FUCKING DEI AND THE WOKENESS TURDS IN THE GAME!!!Its a mythology based game and it has been kept that way in terms of these inclusion shitards. Atleast as far as I have played...Also! No! I am not from China!

Positive,11/10 would die 10 million times again in the first chapter again!
Positive,good but not too difficult but it is very cinematic and the fights are fun.
Positive,Excellent game. This visuals here are on an insane level. Path Tracing looks incredible here as well. Gameplay & animations used is top class & sets a new standard for other games to reach or exceed in 2024 & beyond. Black Myth Wukong also shows what can be done when Unreal Engine 5 is used in the most magnificent of ways. Its a great game to showcase all the strengths of that game engine.
Positive,"After playing 15+ hours in 3 days and now at the beginning of Chap 3, I still feel this game is giving me endless surprise. I am not a Dark Souls player, neither have I tried Elden Ring or Bloodbourne. However, I did enjoy Witcher 3, Death Stranding and Control a lot. It does not mean I don’t like soulslike games. They are just too difficult for me. So I watched my partner playing them through and I watched quite a lot of gameplay videos. When Black Myth Wukong announced its launch date, I thought maybe this time I could give it a try. Here are some points that might be helpful to those who share similar gaming experiences with me, no spoilers:1.I don’t feel dizzy, at all. No motion-sickness. I tried Cyberpunk 2077 which is so attractive to me as well, but I gave up before literally throwing up on the keyboard. I felt sick every time after playing Witcher 3 for 2 or 3 hours, but I played it through because it is just so good. Luckily, I feel absolutely fine playing Wukong! 2.The combat part came out extremely challenging to me, but after repeated practice, I felt really proud when beating the famous Tiger Vanguard and now finally reached to the end of Chap 2. I enjoy both the difficulties and the sense of achievements this game provides. It has a reasonable curve that fits my learning process. Now I feel more confident that I can be better in the next chap.3.Slow down and look around. Or you will miss so many beautiful scenes and so many hiding bosses and secret places. My partner and I started playing at the same time, but we have made some different choices and experienced different interlude scenes. We do not know yet if this will make our endings different (we heard that there are different endings and even different end bosses), but we both decide we need a 2nd or even 3rd play through. Take your time wandering around for the beautiful sights and take some pictures!4.Don’t worry if you are not familiar with Journey to the West stories. I read the book many years ago when I was a teenager and now only a few scenes left. Wukong is indeed based on the story, but you can treat it like a new one told by someone who will eventually tell you what happened before during the game play. We all know some stories told in flashback and some narrations interposed, don’t we? And you are not fooled by fate/narrative because you are the Destined One. It is fine if you focus on the main line, whether you have read Journey to The West or not, but if you know the original story, you will find more from the short stories of each character.Wukong is unique. I mean, not only the bosses but even the most unimpressive yaoguai has a complete set of moves. There isn’t much soulslike dark and depressing style (maybe not yet?) and everything follows the story flow. It does not play fragmented narrative tricks and at the beginning you know you will be on a journey full of hardships with no way back. There is so much I haven’t mentioned yet: music, voice acting, art design, level design…everything is perfect to me, at least for now. And the animations after each chapter are even in different art styles!I do not have much time to play every day so it may take a month or so for me to complete it. The more I play the more I love it. There are flaws and even some little bugs to be fixed though I haven't come acrossed yet. I believe there are players much pickier, much more careful and experienced to action games than I am to point them out. Now I will go back and start my journey in Chap 3. May come back for further comments when I reach the end.As being a Chinese local, I do feel this game is “my game”. Wukong is my hero since I was a kid, knowing him from TV drama version of Journey to The West. Many of the human characters and yaoguais in the novel by Wu cheng’en are not his original but from even earlier Chinese classical myths and legends. It is a big big universe that almost every Chinese kid dreams to experience it because so many things there are just beyond imagination. This game is a dream-become-true.And I do feel this game is THE game, the one that players share their feelings and emotions and response to the story and the characters, like those good games that made history. Over 2M players playing Wukong at the same time means something, and it is SOMETHING. Because it is a real good one that worth playing."
Positive,I hate souls like games mostly because I suck at them. That being said this game is pretty welcoming to those who aren't savvy with the souls like genre. 10/10

Positive,"Very excellent game! But graphic and other stuffs need to be optimized, still got some issues with fps at high speed combats"
Positive,"Amazing game! Graphics and combat are out of this world. Haven’t experienced any frame rate drops or any lag. Highly recommend this game to everyone. Ignore IGN and Sweet Baby Inc., both are trash companies. I’d say this game is about a 9 to 9.5 (they could improve the way the story is delivered)."
Positive,"This game offers a visually stunning experience, boasting beautiful graphic design and exceptional character models that truly bring the world to life. The attention to detail in both the environment and character animations is nothing short of impressive, making it a feast for the eyes from start to finish.However, despite its visual appeal, the gameplay experience left much to be desired—especially for those who prefer playing with a mouse and keyboard. As someone who isn't a controller player, I found the M/K controls to be a complete letdown. The camera movement felt clunky and unresponsive, making it difficult to enjoy the game's otherwise immersive world. Unfortunately, this frustrating experience with the controls led me to ultimately refund the game.If you're a controller player, you might have a different experience, but for M/K users, I can't recommend this game. The poor camera handling and awkward control scheme overshadow the game's visual brilliance."
Positive,"A masterpiece. The plot doesn’t simply retell the complex story of Journey to the West; instead, by a twist of fate, it retraces the path of slaying demons and banishing evil. From a little monkey to a legendary figure, this is the Odyssey of the East."
Positive,"game need hitbox improvement . some bosses need nerf they are annoying af, like: Gold Armored R and stagger mechanic is annoying need to get reduced"
Positive,This game is simply amazing.
Positive,"The combat in this game is smooth and engaging, easy to learn but hard to master, pushing players to explore various fighting styles, skills, and spells. The unique stance system, blending speed and rhythm, tests players' timing, resource management, and reaction time.With numerous, highly imaginative bosses, this game is a dream for those who love challenging boss fights. The bosses' agility is well-matched with the player character's abilities, and most attacks can be perfectly timed by carefully observing the enemy's moves and exploiting their moments of vulnerability, leading to effective combos or counters. Unlike Elden Ring, which deliberately uses counterintuitive mechanics and death penalty to frustrate players, this game avoids such design choices, making the experience more accessible and less punishing.The RPG's progression system is well-balanced, allowing players to respec skill trees freely. There's a rich selection of spells, abilities, armor, and accessories, offering great flexibility in how players build their characters.The story, inspired by Chinese mythology, is particularly engaging and easy to grasp for Chinese players, with some narratives offering deep, philosophical insights. Character design is top-notch, with detailed text narratives for every enemy, boss, and NPC, showing incredible attention to detail.The game boasts highly realistic natural environments, using Unreal Engine 5's real-world scanning technology. The high-resolution scenes are breathtaking, with many buildings showcasing unique Chinese artistic styles. The animation cutscenes are truly masterful, probably surpassing the artistic quality of Netflix’s top-tier productions.The soundtrack is epic, featuring themes that burn with intensity, ritualistic throat singing that adds a sense of mystery, and melodies rich in Chinese cultural elements, each of these elements blending perfectly with traditional Chinese folk music and percussion. The background music is equally impressive, energizing the atmosphere without overshadowing it.The level design falls short; most minor enemies in the game don't provide meaningful combat feedback or rewards. The lack of AOE skills and ranged attacks can make being swarmed by enemies frustrating. Players might find it easier to skip these encounters altogether, perhaps using stealth to reach the next save point.There’s a wealth of hidden content and side quests, which encourages exploration. Completing these side quests not only grants key items and special rewards for defeating hidden bosses but also makes the mainline boss fights significantly easier.The game’s guidance system is lacking; there's no map, and the environments all look similar, making it hard to distinguish different areas. This leads to frequent instances of getting lost, either by struggling to find the correct path or by accidentally ending up back where you started. In addition, too many invisible walls restrict exploration, especially in areas where the environment suggests you should be able to proceed, reflecting a lack of refinement in level design.Performance optimization is another issue, with visual effects causing screen flashes, frame rate drops, and other problems that can negatively impact players with mid-to-low-end PCs.Sometimes the English translation is difficult to follow, with awkward phrasing and some missing text, indicating a lack of polish in the game's localization, which detracts from the experience for international players."
Positive,"I love China, bin chilling. 10/10"
Positive,It's not perfect. But it is totally worth the long wait.
Positive,The Black Loong is the worst boss in the history of gaming.
Positive,"Game Science has recreated a Journey to the West through this redemption story of Wukong in a thrilling and beautiful manner. Even in playing the first Chapter of the game you can truly tell that this game is made with passion in displaying the ancient, fantasy-infused culture of this century old tale. The cinematic cutscenes done after every Chapter are just one of my many favorite aspects about this game. Not to mention the breathtaking environmental landscapes, stunning soundtrack, and uniquely designed NPCs/yaoguais.I am so thrilled to be playing it and I cannot wait to see more amazing things in this game!"

Running smooth as silk on my 4090 with an Intel i9 13900k.Definitely contender for game of the year.

Positive,"What is there not to like about the game?- The presentation is a 10/10 especially with the game flexing the powers of UE5 with the bells and whistles. Right from the get go, you feel enchanted and immersed into the environment and the characters. Also the water effects in this game are phenomenal when RT is on.- Gameplay is addictive and challenging and there is always a new component or layer of depth that is added to ensure it stays fresh. The bosses are varied and their attacks are very well telegraphed, allowing for a genuine combat experience.- Music and sound is overall very fitting and helps complement the actionOne thing of note, is that UE stutter is slightly present in the game when transitioning from an area to the other but i found that it does not really interfere with the game nor detract from its quality. The experience is otherwise very polished and I've yet to encounter any bug. Kudos to the dev team for this major success!"
Positive,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a labor of love. The devs put in so much effort in the English translation, trying to make the lines rhyme just so it sounds poetic like in the original language. If you pay attention to the background music, it changes to the transformation. Each transformation has its own unique BGM to vibe with its playstyle. Speaking of unique, each boss is unique too, and there is A LOT in this game. The game is only a boss rush if you make it to be--there's actually a ton of exploration to do (and secrets to be found.) Sure, the game draws inspirations from popular games like Dark Souls (level design), God of War (combat mechanics), Monster Hunter (weapon tree), etc. but the game is creative and original in its own right.The game has successfully carved out its own identity among the gazillion AAA games that we have in the market today. What's more, coming from a studio (that started with only a few employees) that has ZERO prior experience to making AAA single-player game, it's incredible. Of course, there is always room for improvements and more polishing needs to be done, but in the case of BMW, I have to agree with what the game's creator says in one of his interviews: Completion is more important than perfection.TL;DR: THIS GAME IS VERY FUN TO PLAY!"
Positive,"Good, fun not woke game"
Positive,GOTY FOR ME.
Positive,Monkey See 🐵 Monkey Do🙉
Positive,Graphics are insane. The gameplay is also pretty nice and fluid. Only an hour or so in the game so can't say much about the story but looking pretty solid so far.
Positive,"PRO very rewardinggreat immersive storylinenice fluid combat great skilltreeamazing graphicsCON dodging is sometimes not on point, especially when you fightbossfights are sometimes easier than guardian  fights shrines go out of stock and remain out of stockOverall a great game would recommend 100%"
Positive,"The artistic style, character, dialog, and story is so on point that this master piece feels more like a documentation than re-imagination. This might be the first time the ""mysterious eastern"" is brought to the world seriously at this level. The only thing holding it back is that it contains so much cultural in itself to the point translation is at its limit, and one has to be soaked in the eastern cultural to fully embrace this beauty. It make me shaking when thinking about more of those historical mythology that could be on the making, truly a fantasy feast to feed upon."
Positive,"So, I've finished up to Chapter 2 and played the game over 12 hours. The combat feels amazing and the story is already perfect for me since I've read the mythology and watched the 1986 Journey to the West Series which is really nostalgic. The only complaint I have at the moment is to have a map for explored parts or at least a minimap. Because each part of the maps are very large and dense with environmental details which you can easily lost through your way. But aside from that, overall amazing game. Highly recommended."
Positive,"As a monkey myself, this is the best monkey game to ever come out.Challenging but fun.Silly and serious.Doesn't hold your hand about your knowledge of Chinese Mythology and The Journey to the West."

Positive,"I was stunned by completeness of this game. Please remember this is the first Triple-A game made in China, yet it has great combat system, decent visual effect and above average story line. Hope to see more in the future!PS: Please choose game play dubbed in Chinese. The Chinese Dub is ten times better than English."
Positive,"Im actually surprised how much Ive enjoyed this game even though I rarely play this type of genre. To be honest people compare it to a souls like game but if you want to be vague it is. Its more forgiving due to the fact you dont lose anything from dying but to be fair this game literally makes the rules and you just go along with it and thats ok.-No manual saving (auto save)-No map-No auto skip CS's-No changing difficulty (when people say this game is linear its basically just the story, the combat literally is rough right from the start.  Enimies level scale in the current act or chapter you are in.)-Vendors have a set amount of items and once they are bought they wont refresh till the next chapter. -Gear doesnt drop in this game its materials from x amount of bosses then you can make a gear part. For how hard it is for me Im really enjoying myself even with the 2 hour fights sometimes from all the failing. Just for example im level 43 and mid act / chapter 2 and Im still getting my ass handed to me,The story is good if you know the history but if you dont youll be lost and thats ok there are so many fights in the game and every single boss or mini boss has their own voice overs. The story isnt the star here its the combat. This game is definitely not 20 hours like some people said it is. Maybe if you B line straight to the finish and are literally a god at micoing your character with dodges. Now heres the bad things that ive encountered. Tech wise. If you are like me and like to customize keys because you use mouse and keyboard prepare to either play default settings of use a program to customize keys like I did. Chapter 1 is where I got the most FPS dropping in random parts like nothing big but minor stuttering in certain parts of the map. For reference I have a i9 with a gtx 4090 running on max graphics, with the latest driver just to run this game. Chapter 2 has been better but theres still stutters here and there.  Cant say about the rest since im not there."
Positive,One of the best game i ever played its soooo refreshing finally getting interested to gaming once again thanks to black myth wukong point i like in this game are as followsExploration in this game is soo good and decently rewarding even if u are not soooo pro in the game u can play decently and use items which u found while exploring secret bosses and beat main bosses easily Bosses in this game is sooooo powerful and it just keeps on coming one after another one after another in like ever 5 minutes u will find a boss and its sooo much fun like this and they all have different combat styles and everything i can clearly see how much work the company has put to make them its soo good i love it when i beat the bosses in this gameCutscenes of this game is absolutely treat for the eyes specially the intro scene where main character goes against everyone it really remind me of god of war so many things similar to god of war in this its really a goated game if u ask me love the cutscene's Stance system in this game is umm it depend on ur style u can beat bosses with any stance tbh but its really on u which one u like i personally like smash and piller stance soo much  its sooo good and so satisfying to watch There is alot of more content and stuff in this game and its such a long game it will easily take your 1 month if not much really worth it for the price even if game was 4000 i would buy it anytime but for 3599 inr its the best deal and they really deserve the money me and my friend had to buy it together to make it cheap but i m really gonna buy it for my acc when i make this game perfect game best game ever for me atleast Update: I finished the game and i love it sooooo much it was such a great journey and it has multiple ending so u can play again if u want its really really fun for replay as well and so happy with the ending what a journey totally worth it Would be really happy if u can help me get some steam points!! thank u for reading

Positive,I like this game... you get to play as Monke
Positive,"Honestly jumping into Black Myth: Wukong feels like stepping into a beautiful fever dream where ancient Chinese legends meet Dark Souls-level frustration. The graphics are absolutely stunning, like someone took a traditional ink painting and decided it needed more giant mythological creatures to smash you into the dirt.What I liked? First, the combat. It's smooth, challenging, and has just the right amount of ""I'm going to break this controller"" moments. The variety of enemies keeps you on your toes each battle feels like you're trying to survive a beautifully choreographed dance-off where your partner is a 12-foot-tall beast trying to crush you. The story is mysterious and intriguing, with just enough weirdness to keep you hooked.Also, if you're expecting a walk in the park, this game will happily toss you off a cliff instead. Would I recommend it? Absolutely. If you like a challenge, enjoy mythology, and don’t mind the occasional urge to scream at your screen, this game is for you. Just be prepared to question your life choices as you get repeatedly clobbered by legendary creatures."
Positive,"I became monkey, meditated, ate strange pills, saw through my enemies and read poetry.I am satisfied.Context: I'm just before the last boss of chapter 2 (pretty big and nice chapter).Pros: -  A game set in the Chinese mythology setting is quite fresh.- The combat is fun, the MC is quite agile.- The audio and visuals for hitting opponents is satisfying, you feel that staff hit them on big attacks.- Slowmo on perfect dodge is pretty cool.- The headless bard from chapter 2 was freaking awesome.- In general, the cutscenes and story aren't too heavy.- Free and easy respec.- The bosses aren't pushovers, but they do let you breath a bit. I've been happy with the fights so far.Cons:- There isn't that much variation to the moveset. I feel that the pillar and thrust stances are kinda whack/meh.- The transformations I've seen so far feel kind of clunky.- Some of the skills you can spec into are weirdly worded and unclear.- I'd like to see some numbers instead of ""moderate increase"" or ""significant increase""."

Positive,"I have 112 games in my library and have hardly written any feedback yet. This game is a true masterpiece, the boss fights are always exciting and you always have such an urge to continue, the graphics are very good. The game is an absolute 10/10Conclusion:-Very good graphics-Good game experience-Good story-Exciting fights-Not too difficult-few (almost no) bugs"
Positive,"Final points after beating the game:- The devs do an excellent job in balancing most boss fights. I beat most bosses in 5 tries or less, but most of the time I was tapped out of every ability, out of mana and low on health and estus. On top of that, both the secret boss and the final one are awesome. In terms of boss fights, I had more fun with this game than Shadow of the Erdtree.- It may have been fixed, but there are a couple side quest bugs in chapter 4 - the talisman quest just didn't work for me (got all 3 before fighting the boss and still couldn't pass through the barrier), and the Daoist Mi disappeared - I saw that it's apparently intended for him to disappear if you kill the boss, but I disagree with this decision considering no other quest in the entire game works like that and it's just annoying. Review at the beginning of chapter 6:Game's good, the first 2 chapters are incredibly impressive, and although it falls off afterwards, it's still a great time. I'd rate it as a 7 or 8 out of ten, I think it's more or less on par with 2018 God of War. Below are the most stand-out points for me:The Good:- there's a lot of content and a lot of it is unique. The entire system with abilities you take from killing enemies is cool, the things you can unlock, the secret areas which are hidden in every chapter and several are their own separate levels, there's a lot to do here.- Combat feels great most of the time. The bosses especially stand out - there is a huge variety not only in visual flavour, but also in the mechanics and moves they use.- It ran well on launch - can't believe that's not the standard nowadays but here we are- It looks great most of the time. While some of the landscapes are very bland, especially in chapter 3, the cinematics and scrolls you see at the end of each chapter are awesome.The Bad:- Some bosses have terrible hit boxes or move in a way that makes trying to hit them needlessly irritating. Examples: Lightning Dragon; aids to actually hit, makes you dizzy with all the flying around you, the other fight with her is way better, Hundred Eyes Dood; when you go to hit him, it's anyone's guess whether you hit on of the two front legs or not,- The Story isn't very compelling. In GoW you clearly know what's happening and why even if you never read Greek or Norse mythology. in Wukong, you can grasp some elements of the story, but none of it is really relatable or interesting in terms of character-drama. The worst part is that the main character is mute but for some reason, everybody is talking to him... also the way they transition from chapter to chapter leaves you with more questions than answers.- It has the Elden Ring problem where they made way too much landmass and filled it with copy paste boring filler. To their credit, you don't really see it until chapter 3, but that's also where it's the worst - you'll literally wade through snowy mountains fighting the same 2 enemies for hours. They spruce it up with different enemy types sprinkled in, but it's noticeable and tired me out."
Positive,Monkey very cool
Positive,"The English review is located in the second part of the article.       这是我的第一篇STEAM评论，献给齐天大圣。       首先，这款游戏是我翘首以盼4年之久的心头大爱，从首支预告片发布开始，在我心中一直被压抑已久的那颗期待我们能拥有自己的“3A”游戏大作的种子就已然开始萌发。其实从1994年开始玩游戏到现在30载，我们的国产游戏其实不乏上乘之作，当年的刀剑封魔录、秦殇在那个年代也可算作引领潮流甚至是超越潮流之作，可限于当时的技术条件、市场环境和玩家的消费习惯等诸多因素，让很多佳作无法获得足够的生存空间，让心里的这个种子久久不能萌发。黑神话的出现可算是让这个种子结出了一个“硕果”。        扯远了，回到游戏本身，游戏画面大家有目共睹，彻底消除了大家在看到预告片时的担心，游戏实机画面与预告片可以说完全一致没有任何缩水，环境细节超级细致，让人在一秒内就可完全沉浸在那个光怪陆离又充满无限遐想的西游世界中。并且这款游戏确实让绝大数游玩它的人体会到了热血沸腾的感觉，同时也让很多玩家感受到了足够的挑战性。        热血之处在于如此优良的美工居然可以那么好的融合于流畅的动作打斗之中，并且堪称神级的配乐为每一场景的打斗提供了更深入灵魂的代入感。在游戏中，镜头的锁定不会让玩家视角卡在一些奇奇怪怪的让人无法专心对战的尴尬角度，不论天命人或是小怪还是BOSS的动作都无比流畅且贴合其特征，让每一场打斗都酣畅淋漓。        同时，丰富的动作设计、技能属性和道具也让很多玩家目不暇接，在游戏早期如何合理的分配有限的属性点数，针对不同的场景应该怎么选择合理的技能搭配会让一些对此类型游戏不太精通的玩家感到头疼。但这部分内容对提高玩家在游戏中获得更好的体验，减少被BOSS反复按在地上摩擦而引起的挫败感是很重要的，确实需要玩家静下心来仔细体会和研究，算是一个不大不小的挑战。再者，每一章节的游戏地图让很多像我一样的路痴玩家感到束手无策，有时几个镜头切换就可以让我在原地花很长时间确定正确的路径和方位，实属无奈……       最后，请允许我这个千千万万中国玩家中的一员对我深深热爱的游戏世界说一声：我邀请全世界同样热爱游戏的玩家们一起进入这梦幻的西游世界，享受优质打斗体验，欣赏绝美的中式建筑和奇幻景观，体会充满跌宕起伏的精彩剧情，让我们深厚的历史底蕴在游戏中焕发出勃勃生机，给世界一个全新视角认识我们绵延千年而不断的中华文明。华流无愧顶流！      敬为此付出辛勤努力的游戏科学和全体游戏工作者！！！This is my first STEAM review, dedicated to the Great Sage Equal to Heaven.Firstly, this game has been the apple of my eye, eagerly anticipated for four years since the release of the first trailer. The seed of anticipation for our own ""AAA"" masterpiece has been germinating in my heart ever since. In fact, since I started playing games in 1994, spanning 30 years, our domestic games have not lacked excellent works. The Blade and Sword Sealing Demons, Qin Shang in those years could also be considered as leading the trend or even surpassing the trend, but due to many factors such as the technical conditions at the time, market environment, and players' consumption habits, many excellent works could not get enough survival space, and the seed in my heart could not sprout for a long time. The emergence of Black Myth can be said to have borne a ""fruit"" for this seed.Digressing, back to the game itself, the game's picture is obvious to all, completely eliminating everyone's worries when they saw the trailer. The actual machine picture of the game and the trailer can be said to be completely consistent without any reduction, the environmental details are extremely meticulous, allowing people to immerse themselves in the bizarre and infinitely imaginative Journey to the “Journey to the West” world in one second. And this game indeed made the vast majority of people who played it feel the blood boiling, and also made many players feel enough challenge.The righteous ardour is in such a good art that can be so well integrated into the smooth action fighting, and the divine-level soundtrack provides a more in-depth soul for every scene of the fight. In the game, the camera lock will not let the player's perspective be stuck in some strange and embarrassing angles that make people unable to focus on the battle, no matter the actions of Tianming people or small monsters or BOSS are extremely smooth and fit their characteristics, making every fight refreshing.At the same time, the rich action design, skill attributes, and props also make many players dazzled. In the early stage of the game, how to reasonably distribute the limited attribute points, and how to choose the appropriate skill combination for different scenes will make some players who are not proficient in this type of game feel painful. But this part of the content is very important for improving the player's experience in the game and reducing the frustration caused by being repeatedly rubbed on the ground by the BOSS. It really needs the player to calm down and carefully experience and study, which is a big and small challenge. In addition, the game map of each chapter makes many players like me feel helpless. Sometimes, a few camera switches can make me spend a long time determining the correct path and direction on the spot, which is really helpless...Finally, please allow me, as one of the thousands of Chinese players, to say to the game world I deeply love: I invite players around the world who also love games to enter this dreamy Journey to the West world together, enjoy high-quality fighting experience, appreciate the beautiful Chinese architecture and fantasy landscapes, experience the exciting plot full of ups and downs, let our profound historical heritage shine in the game, and give the world a new perspective to understand our Chinese civilization that has been continuous for thousands of years. Chinese Trend is worthy of the top flow!In the end ,I pay tribute to the hard work of the game science and all the game workers!!!"

Positive,"Fun game, def reminds you of a souls like but also it is it own thing."
Positive,As Wukong Fans ~ this was the 10/10 Game ~  Enjoy the view + game
Positive,i wukong-mend this game
Positive,"Note: This review was originally Not Recommended but is now switched to Recommended.It seems like Game Science spent their budget on Chapters 3 to 6. Right up to Chapter 2 the story was stale and the characters were extremely forgettable. This made the jank the main focus of the game with very few redeeming qualities. From Chapter 3 onwards, each Chapter starts to have compelling mini stories embedded within the over-arching storyline with characters that you can come to appreciate by the end of the chapter. The bad points mentioned in the original review still persist but they become bearable.By this point you should have enough spells, spirits and sparks unlocked to experiment with a variety of attack patterns and that is where things get really fun. You also start to get a hang for the perfect dodging - even though the dodge timings are still very inconsistent. What truly impelled me to switch my review from Not Recommended to Recommended were the final boss fights of both endings. In particular, the secret one was really impressive and I'll just say it - you'll have to experience it for yourself firsthand. Buy the game.-- Before 2024/09/01; Originally: Not RecommendedThe good:- I think the combat is very interesting, with the idea of perfect dodging it does invoke some of the same excitement as Sekiro where perfect parries and staying on the enemy are greatly rewarded. It gets really fast paced once you have some upgrades in stamina, you can chain attack combos into dodges and move back into combos again. The upgrades available make it seem like the devs intend the game to be played this way, rewarding you for long attack combos, perfect dodging and allowing you to resume the attack chain from where you left off after dodging. The combat is pretty satisfying once you get the hang of it.- It is very beautiful, the cut scenes are nice and one can tell a lot of effort has been put into making it so. The interfaces look very clean, I really like the meditation spots where they slow down the game a little bit for you to appreciate some of the landscape around you. The painting you see after completing Chapter 1 allows you to zoom in and let the narrator explain the piece of art. I think that's pretty cool.- The enemies are interesting both in design and attack patterns and as someone who grew up watching Journey to the West, seeing some of them does bring back some of that nostalgia.The bad:- You can feel the lack of experience of the studio even as you navigate across the map. I'm talking about little things like jumping over obstacles or walking up the stairs or walking across rocks or even just walking across the floor, all of those animations feel very unpolished. The way you suddenly get stopped in your tracks or stutter across the map due to random artifacts adds to this unpolished feeling. - Hitting enemies feel very lackluster. Some enemies look like you shouldn't be tickling them with the staff but you do. The heavy attacks sometimes don't feel very heavy.- In a game that rewards perfect dodging I need to trust that the hitbox follows the attack animation but there are times where the hitbox is unclear either because they are oddly placed or because the attack animations just aren't big enough and you can see yourself being hit from somewhere that does not appear to have any reason why you should be hit from that direction.- The boss animations are still very janky, movements are stiff and some of those with bigger movements sometimes zip around the boss arena in unnatural ways. There is sometimes an obvious disconnect between the attack animation, the way you are hit, and the way your character's body responds to the hit. The slow-mo effect is kind of cool, but I can't tell if it actually affects the timing between attacks or if it preserves it. Some bosses feel like the next attack after doing a perfect dodge (and triggering the slow-mo effect) flies out too fast as if it's trying to catch up to a specific timing.- Some of the english translations are hard to read as if multiple different translation teams worked on it and one of them is just that much worse compared to the rest.The worst:This portion is going to be centered around the Last Boss Fight of the 2nd chapter. This boss fight highlights the worst portions of the game design.- The walk to the boss is full of the afore-mentioned unpolished movements, you find yourself unable to jump over rocks that are lower than your shin, you jitter up and down as you walk over some rocky portions. The devs should know that players will be walking down this road a few times before beating the boss but this walk highlights the worst parts of the in-game movement. There is also an invisible line where the lighting and shadows cast completely change before and after crossing it.- This boss moves a lot around the map and boy are the animations clowny. The boss' jump attack animations are stiff, so you don't get a nice smooth downward slash that you can anticipate. You get a flying sprite of a boss in a specific pose and then the attack itself happens very quickly. This forces you to dodge based on timing instead of looking at when the slash will happen.- This boss arena design has issues. The boundaries of the arena shrink a little bit in the ""second phase"". But when you go up against what the boundaries are now made of you don't get any indication that you are going up against the material of the boundary in question. Also, the boss can attack from outside of this boundary, and the visibility of the boss beyond this boundary is difficult (but not impossible) to see. I feel like it should only be one of these things. Either I can attack the boss throughout the whole arena or I should be able to see the boss as he starts attacking but in this case, I both cannot see (clearly) and cannot touch the boss- The boss is very mobile but it sometimes slides across the floor as if the boss needed to be in a certain position at a certain time but the animations weren't properly done to show how the boss could have gotten to that position.- There is a grab attack that has some of the least obvious grab animations I have seen in any video game. You will get used to it eventually once you know to look out for it but I just feel dissatisfied every time I do get caught by it-  The boss intermittently calls on something to pounce on you. The animation of this thing is choppy and rigid in the most painfully obvious way- Weird hitboxes persist hereReason for rating:It's a decent game and for a new developer it's a pretty remarkable feat. But, I'll probably put it aside for awhile for the devs to polish it a bit further. There are parts of the game which make it clear that more effort was put into making it look good than making it perform good. Because of that, I can't say it's worth the price in its current state however."
Positive,Worth waiting for.
Positive,"It's my first time to play a game like thisAn EXCELLENT story,and a good game,even a bit difficult for meI hope friends around the world would enjoy this,first 3A Game of China,without any political factors"
Positive,"Graphics are insane , combat feels smooth. This has to be GOTY"
Positive,graphics good 👍music good  👍gameplay good  👍performance good 👍game good 😎👍
Positive,This game in 1 word would be phenomenal... the visuals and sounds are perfect. The fights are hard enough to make me mad but beatable so I don't rage uninstall the game. I couldn't get into Elden Ring because it's just too much. This game is perfect for this genre I think. The acting is all in Chinese so I'm actually playing it with the Chinese dialogue but English subtitles and it's so good!
Positive,"The game is good, but have several annoying flaws...First the D.A is really great, nothing to say about it, sound design and music are great, the boss have really nice patern....The big black points are level design, he is really outdated, they put invisible wall everywere. The exploration is really frustrating, why don't put minimap when you make invisible wall everywhere! Second things it's the combat system, it's a mix between nice and frustrating features:  -you have not enought feedback to know the situation of your actual combat (the energy point are not appear enough in the screen or on your weapon)  -the worst is you can't dodge during an actual combo, like your character are making a chain light attack, you have to learn this combo very well because when you are engaging the following you can't dodge during several millisecond...it's like really frustrating because the combo are not neat like God of war, they are really confuse and you can t detect really clearly at what step you are in your combo, and it's even difficult sometime to not understand why you are not touching the enemy (hit box problem or visual combo are confuse?) -some input are cancel because you are pressing other input....this thing is really basic i don't understand how they not correct that before releasing (like try running and make an heavy attack, you have to stop to press the bottom running on the joystick, stop the character and after press the bottom heavy attack...i mean WTF)It's difficult to not compare this game with existings games...for me, this game it's little downside of God of war and ghost of Tsushima. I thing the huge score on steam are multi-factorial,  first by a huge Chinese patriots community and second by the actual situtation of the game market, because the game is not woke and developer just make a game for the gamer , and i think the casual gamer may like it more than a dark soul.It's a good first AAA from China but for me they are not at the level of Japanese license like From software and USA game like santa monica studio for the moment. (my POV)For me it's a 16/20, not bad at all, nice game but not a GOTY like steam score seems to announce."

Positive,Whoever designed the pagoda needs help
Positive,"so far the compared to like Dark Souls 3 the game seems pretty linear, less items like weapons, armor, consumables to collect, but it's so fluid and so satisfying and well made. Also there is a skill tree, you can't lose souls upon dying, no levelling up like in Dark Souls, it's more comparable to Sekiro I would say. I'm really enjoying the game so far :) like a good 4/5"
Positive,"I should say this game is the peak of gaming right now? Definitely YES!Maybe I'm not a good player of this genre (included Dark Souls and/or Elden Ring or other games like these) but I played a lot of games and completed a lot of franchise and I honestly can say the graphics ARE AWESOME! Also the story and the roots of this story, maybe we all know who Wukong is so no words to say here.Making this game in Unreal Engine 5 we just clearly see all the capabilities this engine has right now. I'm using RTX 4060 TI the 16GB VRAM version, all graphic settings set to Cinematic with DLSS to 65% (quality) with Frame Generation and I have an average range of 65 - 85fps on 1080p (depending of the map and environment). So yea, it's just the first release of this game but I'm sure with few patches they will improve A LOT the performances as we all expect."
Positive,"great fights i recommand this game, for me its a mix of god of war and elden ring"
Positive,Western developers take notes. We want games like this. Not the slop you put out.

Positive,"OH MA GAWD!EPIC! 11/10 IGNGo buy it, stop reading reviews224k+ Overwhelmingly positive reviews should be all you need to know..."
Positive,"Very fun and beautiful game and story wise its good so far for me at least but compatibility wise i did have to adjust some settings, i changed it to DLSS setting and could still run it at cinematic without lagging although for some people it might be an issue ( running on ryzen7+ 3060ti ). LOVE THE GAME ( Not everyones cup of tea, can't tell whether its a soulslike or something similar to God of War and it has major roadblock bosses along the way with very questionable enivorment and mechanics ). The game so far is a ""High 9/10"" for me."
Positive,"Sweet baby inc. tried using extortion to make this game in their own image, Game Science told them no, journalists went on a smear campaign to try and dissuade people from buying it. After six hours of getting my butt kicked, I gotta say, I am having fun with the game. It feels more akin to bloodborne being that it takes this aggressive approach towards combat, using all you have at your disposal to fight the bosses, and specking yourself just right. If you're not sure, don't worry. You can respec your character for free. The combat is good, but not great. I noticed sometimes my input was delayed ala Dead Space 1 (OG's remember), but it wasn't to the point of detriment. Progression is pretty linear, but it's not a bad thing. You have areas you can scrounge for materials, but ultimately it's not open world like anything soulsborne. And honestly that is fine. It's linear with some open world traversing. So 80% linear, 20% open, give or take. The animations on the characters while fighting look amazing, and give off this sense of natural movement, such as while locked on to an enemy and strafing, you skip a couple times. Cinematography looks prestine. Like it was an action movie with how the angles and shots were directed. I really don't have much to complain about, except for the mentioned input lag. Once again, I'm throwing shade at sweet baby because they tried to run this game in the mud. Congrats to Game Science for making your very first 3rd person action adventure, and wish good things to the people who worked on this game. I appreciate you sticking to your guns and not letting woke bullies scare you into taking their money. Even if you don't play it, buy the game out of spite against those jokers."

Positive,"The movement feels fluid and the graphics are top notch, Story is cool and overall this game is awesome"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong significantly draws upon the knowledge of ""Journey to the West"" to fully grasp its narrative and themes. While the gameplay exhibits some minor flaws, it does not appear to be underdeveloped. The game's graphics and environments are its standout features, making it a worthwhile investment."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong may be the best possible way to share the Mythological story of Wukong.With the nature of the souls-like mechanics of traveling to previous shrines to speed your way through area you have already played through, with new abilities and insights, gives a participative window into the very framework of mythology and it's nature of repetition as story, with the action gameplay of something like God of War.A hero that grows and improves with each telling of the story, with each new encounter his legend and prowess grows. Are they new foes or old familiar friends? I love that I get to learn about this amazing mythology through my favorite story mediums.I was recently reintroduced to the story of Sun Wukong.""The novel never explains how the pillar was made, only that it was originally used by Yu the Great to measure the depths of the world flood during times immemorial.""As I am playing this game, Black Myth: Wukong which, seems to me to be, a Mythological ""telling"", there is a fight and Sun Wukong falls through the clouds, to earth and crashes on a mountain top, the clouds being a veil between the heavenly realm hierarchy and the worldly earthly domain.I find it interesting that my introduction to a Mythological character is through a medium of a bounded simulated environment that can be gone over from the beginning, repeated with new unlocked abilities as if the very process of engaging with this style of action rpg is a Mythological participation in the legend of Wukong as a character. Where enemies almost become familiar friends, and the unknown is explored and returned to for fresh insights.It is very interesting to see this idea of ""gathering the aspects"" and ""resurrection of the legend"". And due to the medium of video games it leans into the idea that stories are told and retold, the legend is gathered and it grows.There is a heavy theme of transformation.Instead of playing as Sun Wukong, the game has you playing as """"John"" Wukong"" ""remembering "" the legend of the ""fallen"" Sun Wukong, where you journey back and forth through an Mystical world of powerful beings and spirits.There is something to be said about what it means to participate in storytelling, to participate in history, and how to gather things to attend to, and what the very purpose of our attention is.And I can imagine that if one was to engage with (tell) the game (story) long enough to collect the aspects of the character and bring them to the place where they can be gathered to resurrect the legend, then it is an image of acting out the participation in the legend as an embedded microcosm of learning what it means to be Wukong. The player who plays to the end, like a listener who listens to the whole story, might as well be the hero themselves. At that point there is little difference in a Mythological framework. I feel like it echos a vital shape of what story and history is.And I think this is an example of how we can find similarities in the higher purposes of story and myth so that story, word, speech, behavior and actions can be unified with a universal history, and that some stories are better told than others.I am blessed to be able to share this story. I love the meditation spots. The light flash of the screen is a soft harbinger of the ringing chime calling me back to action after closing my eyes alongside my avatar."
Positive,"Highly recommended. With exquisite graphics, thrilling battles, diverse boss designs, and a deep story line. However, there are some drawbacks, such as the collision with large enemies causing the main character to be stuck, resulting in missed attacks. Some bosses also have an imperfect camera angle. Overall, I highly recommend playing this game."

Stances that do different attacks, weapon and armor crafting with set bonus and affixes.SO MANY bosses!  they are well designed, can be difficult and feel awesome when you finally win.Transformations are a new system for souls-likes as far as I know and they work so well in this.Performance is excellent! I have a 4070, Ryzen 7 5800x3D and 32GB of RAM and i can run it on Very High with Ray Tracing cranked and maintain about 75 fps at 1440p with DLSS set to Quality.The game is SO gorgeous.

Positive,"Ubisoft take notes. This is what a ""AAAA"" title looks like."
Positive,"Haven't beaten the game yet to give a definitive review but so far it's a great experience. It has elements of souls' games but I wouldn't call it souls-like since its far less punishing and allows more leeway in boss fights. The visuals are stunning and game runs pretty well, it isn't as demanding as I'd thought it'd be considering I'm running it on somewhat a mid-range system. I don't recommend getting the game for the deck, definitely not a fun time despite some people saying it's ""awesome"", tested it myself. Level design leaves a lot to be desired but the game focuses more on flashy boss fights and it does a great job at delivering that.Update: After having beaten the game (along with the secret ending), I can say it is a good game. My gripes still remain about the level design, I'd always be gunning for the next boss while finding some secrets here and there, then there's invisible walls/boundaries. Wish there was some fun way to traverse levels, I mean you're a monkey for crying out loud. Nothing interesting happens outside of boss fights other than basic mobs but the different biomes are nice. The combat is alright, gets stale pretty quick without much challenge though it did shine during the final and secret bosses,Yellow Loong and Hundred Eyed Daoist were also quite challenging. Storytelling is also okay ig, I'm not a big fan of JttW but some scenes (especially the end chapter scenes) got me invested but for the most part it's just ehh. English dub for the game is surprisingly good except for the fact that there's no lipsyncing for them so it's jarring during cutscenes. The soundtrack didn't really stand out as much until the last few segments (exception with the end chapter scenes). There were some minor bugs especially one that broke the camera during the final fight which annoyed the shit out of me but overall it's polished.TL;DR Good game, a tad overrated it isn't anything groundbreaking but it doesn't have to be."

Positive,"I am sooooo proud of this game, about the content and especially combat mechanics. As a kid watching 'JOURNEY TO THE WEST'(WE KONG) since I was born it has influenced my so much, my childhood 'Superman'.Pls feel free to ask any questions about the game or the story. Hope u enjoy playing it."
Positive,"Its not a classic dark souls game, it plays more like Sekiro except you have to dodge attacks instead of parry. Some areas have invisible walls which kinda annoys me but nevertheless there are still secrets to discover. The combat is really fun."
Positive,monke good game good
Positive,"I love this game! the setting, the combat and the graphic is insane!"
Positive,"The best game I have ever played.  each chapter you finish, you are rewarded with a story that delves in deeper, the character within that chapter.  this game tugs with your emotion, from realizing how dark humanity can be, and how also love can be found in many places.  it's an amazing journey all the way, like a good book that you can't wait to turn the next page to.  the pacing is nice, and just when you hit the cresendo of the game where you have the best gear and weapon and ready to kick some gods ass, the game takes a soft u-turn. it reminds you of the inevitable, and it doesn't forces you to accept it, but you realize as you go a long the whole reflection of ones life, from the beginning to the end, the greatest battle is within us."
Positive,"If you mix in God of War gameplay elements with Soulslike bosses all wrapped up in kung fu gift wrap, you get the leading GOTY candidate Black Myth: Wukong."
Positive,such a good game
Positive,What is this boss rush game?! I become the boss I beat!Unexpected Masterpiece!
Positive,Uber fun Embrace Monke!!!!
Positive,"First 15 mins alone are GOTY. Better performance on launch than elden ring by a landslide. Blue baby boss the worst thing ive come across so far, i assumed balancing on pole stance would make me immune to ground aoe, also kinda dumb that if u freeze him he continues auto aiming u down as soon as freeze ends. Minor complaint but i was stuck on him for 2hrs so venting. Another complaint is that English voices don't match characters on screen but i switched to chinese and its better. Game is more similar to nioh 2 than souls so good for souls-like fatigue."
Positive,Best game ever.
Positive,It's like a mixture of Fergie and Jesus (Souls & Gow)
Positive,"This is a very interesting game, and I'm really immersed in it"
Positive,Could monkey around 10/10. Now i want a hellcat
Positive,This game has game of the year potential. simply a amazing game!
Positive,F*CK IGN and all other woke b*st*rds.
Positive,"YOU MAY GET BOTTLE NECKED.. They need to do some patching and tweaking with numbers & boss damg, will MAYBE come back if changedThese bosses are soime GRADE A bull$hit with oneshot combos, when you miss ONE dodge in a 3 hit combo your done. you have to spend more time fighting the camera where the ""dode"" the boss attacks that still will hit you.They need to work on the Damage number and Increase numbers when using SKills/Perks they Make ZERO help when upgrading the health increase and Def skills to max, Tiger boss still would one shot combo the stone Vanguard will also and so will Electric Pig."
Positive,"As a fan of the souls-adjacent games (but as of yet have been too scared to actually play a souls game), this has been great. It reminds me of Jedi fallen order on the harder difficulties.The graphics are great, there's a bunch of QoL features like many rest stops and free re-specing. I have had pretty good performance with an AMD RX 7900 GRE, most of the time about 80fps-100fps with occasional dips to 60, with everything cranked but no RT. The English localization in the dialogue is ...interesting for some characters, but overall I have enjoyed the story, and learning a bit about Chinese Mythology.8.5/10"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is an extraordinary action game that captivates players with its stunning visuals and engaging gameplay. The combat mechanics are smooth, making each battle feel thrilling and satisfying. The world is rich in detail, offering a deep and immersive experience that keeps you coming back for more. Whether you're a fan of mythology or just love well-crafted action games, Black Myth: Wukong delivers an unforgettable journey through a beautifully designed universe."
Positive,F*ck the Yellow wind sage going outside the map.
Positive,"This is absolutely stunning, what on earth is this !  No cap, GOTY"
Positive,first impression is amazing!
Positive,"5 hours in, so far having a good time. some enemies and bosses are re-skin but i don't mind it too much.there isn't much to explore so in sense of exploration map but the boss fights and movement are honestly what keeps the game going for me. I think it's solid game so far."
Positive,"this game is such a beautiful scenic movie that as a casual player, i get to enjoy even if i get my a$$ kicked multiple times early on! i am 100% going to recommend this game to anyone and everyone i possibly can. dont ever think of it as a souls like game because it is clearly not. also if you think its a bad or boring game, then you just have major skill issues that you gotta work on"
Positive,"This is absolutely a phenomenal game.with incredible enemy designs and gorgeous music. I would say this is the GOTY. I enjoy playing so far and looking forward to venturing into further chapter. Storywise, I would comment after I finish the whole game. And I hope you all can enjoy this game, too."
Positive,"become monke, game of the year. kill different colour schloong's (epic). free banger's from headless monk and weird old guy with big alcohol bottle talking gibberish 10/10"
Positive,"It's been a long time since I have so much fun playing a single player video game, and Black Myth Wukong delivered.Story wise, I'm a big fan of Journey to the West story, so I'm very familiar with the lore and background of Wukong and the characters in this game. However, I feel that the game could've done a better job at explaining the lore of Wukong in the beginning of the game. Just for the sake of people who aren't familiar with Journey to the West.Graphic wise, the game looks absolutely beautiful, but not as optimized as I expected. I have an RTX 4070, but couldn't fully optimize the game. Struggling to run smoothly at 60 fps at 4k Very High settings. Had to drop my resolution to 1440p, and I'm able to run the game stable at 70++ fps at Very high settings. I wish the game isn't really resource demanding as it is now."
Positive,"Fluid, challenging, and beautiful. Simply great."
Positive,"trust me, just buy it !!"
Positive,Best Game with Chinese Culture!

Positive,Game of the year without a doubt !!!
Positive,"Been waiting for this game! And its worth it!!!And now, I have finished the game and currently playing NG+ has a 100% replay value, waiting for the next DLC or installment of the game."
Positive,"*Edit 2. After finally finishing the game, I can fully confirm my below statement. The game only gets better, from playing Shadow of the Collosus to potentially becoming a Colossal. The Journey to the West has never felt more thrilling in this telling.Is it worth the full price? Of course! The game is so full of content and even replayability that it feels more than worth, there is so much to do and see, so many unique bosses, secret and mandatory. An incredible story told.I have never enjoyed a game like this before. I've played every souls and bloodborne, but nothing could ever compare to this masterpiece. Even if you've seen someone play it, try it yourself, nothing feels more rewarding than being stuck on a boss and finally kicking their butt! I wish I could forget this game so I could play it again from the beginning. Thank you for reading! --Below is more in depth review. All of this was finished with all bosses beaten including the secrets all pre-patches. --*Edit 1. Chapter 3 has one area that sucks massive pills. Everything outside of this place is great, before and after. A skip area button would make everyone happy. I somehow managed to beat both of the areas Bosses in one try, even one that spams always hit-ya kind of attacks couldn't stop me. I WANTED OUT OF THIS HELL!The final fight of Chapter 3 does well make up for the pain. You also get a loveable and quippy traveling companion going forward who is the most amazing traveling partner to the story.Once you reach chapter 4, everything onward gets better and better!Regardless, onto the rest of the review..Voice Acting = 10/10If you are English, run subtitles and enjoy it in the original Chinese Dub, it feels so good. The English Dubbing cast are amazing, both are great ways to experience the game. English actors capture the feel of the characters while the Chinese Dub in Mandarin, the original sound is so authentic, it genuinely fits the face you see!Artwork = 10/10The backgrounds, designs, and feel of the worlds are so unique and amazing. Each area feels nothing like a copy/paste, having every area feel new and a need to explore.Audio/Sound Effects = 10/10It couldn't feel more like watching a movie and feeling immersed in the world itself. It is ON POINT.Models/Designs = 10/10Beautiful and amazing depictions of Chinese Mythos and Folklore. Amazingly brought to life by these talented artists!Combat/Bosses...General Combat is a 7/10 while Boss fights are around a 9/10. Sometimes your hits don't register which can be irritating. Boss fights are genuinely fun to learn and play out. Some are annoying at first, but you really do get used to the patterns. I find myself losing to beat it on the second or third try. Some I can beat right away. Other times, I was taken aback by how amazing the fights felt that I lost focus and got myself killed.Overall for the flow, it feels fun. It's unique and you learn many different stances with unique spells to empower your character. The best aspect in my opinion are the transformations, it's extremely fun to turn into a giant rock to hailmary into the enemy before you.Even the fodder npcs are unique, none are the same as far as I have reached. Their quips are enjoyable and bring good life to the background between bosses and story.That being said, the Story itself is a big 10/10, I love the way it leads you and I was on the edge of my seat at some parts extremely hyper.Glitches/Bugs?Personally, I haven't come across much in my first playthrough, no glitches, broken enemies or frozen in place. My only gripe is that even though my pc is a beast of a thing, I have to run the game on medium quality with most settings turned right down just to have steady frames, decent quality without the audio cutting in and out. It gets annoying more when you are in the middle of an epic cutscene to have the audio flicker, then be out of sync for the rest of it.Some choppy animation freezes in cutscenes, but it only really seems to be those. The actual playing of the game is fluent. Clean.Overall, it reminds me of Sekiro mixed with God of War. Yet in its own way, it really feels like its own unique game. I can't say I've enjoyed a game as much as I have, Black Myth: Wukong.I usually write out joke reviews, but this one deserves full praise and award.My Overall rating of this game is a solid 9/10. When the cinematics are optimized and don't cause audio/graphical freezes will my opinion become a 10/10."
Positive,Challenging game but so much fun to play.
Positive,"Refreshing game. Finally after a long period of drought, gamers have been  blessed with this excellent game. Beautiful game."
Positive,"It is technically impressive. It looks great and runs good. Day 1 release of a big game is expected to be a technical mess. This isn't. Everything is fine. Fun game.It is a soulslike in all the ways that matter. It does do quite some things differently, some of which are better and some worse.An example of a good one would be the better tuned and overall much easier difficulty while retaining the satisfaction. It eliminates a lot of the frustrations of souls likes.Another would be the pretty streamlined approach to itemization and progression. Think Sekiro. Also, the story does feel pretty vague if you don't have prior knowledge of the literature, it doesn't actually go out of its way to be ambiguous, like souls like generally do. I pretty much always have a sense of what I'm doing and why. At least in general terms. All of the above do make it more accessible to new players to the genre.Also your arsenal all the time is way more varied than both souls likes and Sekiro. So you always have a choice of what and when to use DURING combat as opposed to just in terms of character customization BEFORE the fights.Exploration is better than the majority of games but worse than Darksouls 1/2 mainly due to aggressive use of invisible walls. Not the secret kind of invisible walls. Speaking of Darksouls 2, they do share the world structure in terms of alternating linearity with branching paths. This I always say it's the best approach for devs to take cause you get the open world feel without losing control of pacing like Elden Ring...The sheer quantity of content is impressive. Plenty of unique bosses. It is much easier. You will go through bosses in a much faster fashion but that's even more impressive. It's easier to say your game has 40 hours when most of the bosses require 1 hour of trial and error. It's harder to actually be 40 hours long because of good unique content experienced in an un-infuriating fashion. It does have some harder bosses but think something like 5-10 tries. At least so far.A problem I found which is not immediately apparent is the fact that I expected more China. Well, I say problem, but in fact its a more of a missed potential situation. Plenty of sequences I can show anyone and they can fit in basically any dark souls. Not to mention Sekiro. I mean this is obviously the point of view of a non-Chinese but although it has beautiful and diverse biomes, they lack identity, specifically Chinese identity. They also went for the photo-realistic look which, while impressive, it does wear off pretty fast."
Positive,Apes together strong!
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is all about cool fights and crazy monsters.All we need is a ""Map""."
Positive,Hoooo hooo haaa haaa HEEE EEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
Positive,It's Awesome Game and it's good to play in high graphics in Moderate FPS which is more good and The High Graphics of the game is just fu**ing amazing . My Pc RTX 4060Good to play in High Graphics Mode with good fps
Positive,return to monke
Positive,"Stunning visuals. If you like aggressive and fast-paced play style this game is for you. Needs improvement on optimization, crashes on i9-13900k rtx4070ti but putting in -dx12 on launch options fixes it."
Positive,yes what ynoctis said 10/10
Positive,God of war basically had a mythological Chinese baby.
Positive,"I've played 2 ish hours and have loved this game. the graphics are amazing, combat is fun and engaging, and the enemies are fun to fight. The world is visually pleasing and doesn't feel too cluttered. If this inst game of the year or a contender the whole thing is rigged"
Positive,"Some times i'm Monke, sometimes i'm not."
Positive,Excellent in every aspect
Positive,It's so addictive. Highlight Game of the year so far
Positive,"I've beaten the 1st chapter and so far can say that the game is good. There are small stutters here and there, but generally speaking the game performance has been rather flawless on my PC. Playing 4K with very high settings and medium ray tracing, I hit about 90+ FPS. GPU is RTX 4070ti Super.I like the environment, the story telling that has been there so far and the bosses feel fair to fight, though some can be quite hard and just need patience and learn.Will probably update this review at a later stage again after playing more."
Positive,go f**k your self sweet baby. this game is a masterpiece
Positive,Never gonna let you downNever gonna run around and desert youNever gonna make you cryNever gonna say goodbyeNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Positive,10/10 amazing monke
Positive,"It's not perfect, but good enough to be GOTY."
Positive,I returned to monkey now I can save a lot of money by not having to shave anymore.
Positive,Monkey D. Luffy simulator so good that even if it kills my graphics card it's worth the sacrifice
Positive,"Ok now past 50 hours in and after thinking the game was too hard at one point I have to say persistence paid off. This game is VERY challenging but so freaking rewarding and it's well worth the effort. I'm super happy with this game it's by far exceeded my expectations. As for difficulty I'd say it's easier then Sekiro harder then God of War (and no I don't play souls games like Elden Ring, Dark Souls, etc) I'll probably write more in the future but yeah, totally buy it."
Positive,hoo hoo hah ooh ha
Positive,best game ever dont @ me
Positive,G O T Y
Positive,"At first, I thought this game was gonna be another Souls-like, but after playing and getting my first death, I didn’t lose any XP or anything—it all stayed with me. Feels more like a Chinese version of God of War (because of the mythology) mixed with Devil May Cry, with all the skills and stuff. Yeah, this game’s got that PlayStation vibe. After waiting 7 years for this, I gotta say, I’m not disappointed. But, the optimization could’ve been better, especially with the cinematic graphics setting. Other than that, it’s solid—I didn’t get any stutters or crashes, and the game runs super smooth on very high settings."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong: -Absolutely worth the wait and lives up to the hype.-Amazing graphics, gameplay, voice acting, music, donghua.-For fans of the original Journey to the West novel and TV series, and any derived, animated series, including Dragonball Z, Naruto, One Piece, this hits the nostalgia factor with the authentic lore, storyline, and accurate depiction of Sun Wukong and other aspects of Chinese mythology that have inspired so much more.-Headless Monk/10"
Positive,Unique story telling & beautiful Graphics/soundtracks  Pros  +Monke+Smooth quick combat +Astonishing variety Skills+Souls-like but without the harsh punishment of losing Exp/will+Reset your skills/Relics anytime with ease+Variety of Unlockable Gear to help in your journey +New Game+ (New Cycle) more EXP & Will and new weapons  Cons  None becuz its Game of the Year 2024 mark my words   Verdict I Dare you not to play it  -Written by Wukong
Positive,"Responses to the haters : a)  Keybindings : Good players don't complain about keybindings. All I have to say. For those who doesn't know, you can have customized keybinds, but the default is the most reasonable for me. I use a keyboard and mouse. b)  Blocking/Deflecting : There are blocking mechanisms in the game as you progress in the game, in the form of spells and not really with the staff. Additionally,  you can do powerful attacks to cancel enemy attacks or abilities when done right, or stun them . I am not the dev as the gameplay could be intended to be like this. But, Imagine the amount of work devs needs to do to create that. There are 3 different attack-style ""division"" with the staff in the game, at least 60+ unique ""big"" monsters, each with their own unique abilities. To effectively deflect, timing needs to be right, so lots of data and works needs to be done (and for each monster's attack/abilities patterns. There are already dodging and other mechanisms to avoid being attacked depending on the attack style division you put skill points in, the spells you have, etc. If you're still complaining, I guess the game is not for you (respectfully). Otherwise, get gooder. c)  On LGBTQ Topic : Many of those people are bots and trollers. First of all, this game is based on folklore in the 1500s about a monkey. Putting world history and the region background aside, there is no difference in appearance for a male or female monkey. If you want boobs, play another game. There are no gender indications of the monkey's (protagonist's) gender. The main character is not actually ""Wukong"" as that Wukong ""died"". There isn't anything political or anti-LBGTQ in the game unless you think that way. Step into the real world, protest for the actual rights of people, and make that real change rather than being a bot and typing behind the screens.  For people who enjoy the game and want to learn more : a) There are many details in the game that relate to the culture/beliefs if you're interested. For example, there is a reason why the character uses his left hand to put the incense onto the shrine and a reason why it's just one incense when normal people (must) use three or how you usually see a lot of incense. Pretty cool information if you investigate or learn about the details of the game. b) The game has multiple side quests, hidden chests, and strategies. Always, always, spam the conversations with NPCs until the conversation is repeated, and  listen/read to the conversations as there could be crucial information .c) Spoiler:  There are multiple endings to the game every time you complete the game (2 so far, and more to come)"

Positive,"Game of the year. Beautiful visually, smooth, and full of action. When I first initially launched it I experienced a crash right when the chapter 1 scene appeared. The game is challenging but rewarding. Glad to see they stuck true to the source material and didn't add any bs"
Positive,"Visually, the game is stunning, with detailed environments, not to mention how BEAUTIFUL the cinematic are. The story line is intriguing, pulling you into a complex narrative that keeps you engaged from the start.The game seems to heavily focus on boss fights which blends the feel with Sekiro's game play style alongside how God Of War uses abilities. So far each fight feels uniquely challenging and having their own quirks. Which requires skills and strategy to beat. In short: Buy or dumb."
Positive,Do you like enemies that spam endless attacks? How about headaches and high blood pressure?Is your idea of replay value dying over and over and over?Then you should NOT hesitate to buy this game!Honestly though...I'm really enjoying this game. God of War/Dark Souls type vibe.Great story so far with fast paced battles. The graphics and environments are beautiful and change from chapter to chapter. 10/10
Positive,Took me about 30 attempts maybe more maybe less ( roughly 1 hour 40 mins) to finally beat yellow wind sage boss. But that does not change my opinion at all the game is brilliant no complaints from me would reccomend
Positive,super awesome sauce
Positive,"good game with good quality. Rather considering this game is god or war lite in the first day, it is more tend to soul-like for me. Some bosses took me quite long time to beat. Energy-consuming！ Even harder than Elder ring from my point of view. There are few drawbacks on the guiding system (basically no guide no map), and too many hidden quests and bosses. If you do not look some god view video, you may not find the mechanism to trigger the chain of quests. All what I want to say is the GUIDE is TOO LESS!!"
Positive,This is the kind of game that makes you want to check their recruiting website and see if there's any opening position for engineers. Man it must feel good to be a part of team that built such project from scratch. I don't have the recollection of when was the last time I had this much fun in a hack&slash/souls like title. Great work Game Science.

Positive,Mankeeeeeeee 100 out of 10!
Positive,"通关用时70h+如果不算隐藏结局，总游戏时常60h+。二评如下：先说打分，如果不算剧情，文案优秀，画面华美，音乐用心，称得上是精品游戏，游戏整体我给9/10分，由于太多台词与文案考究《西游记》原著，我愿意多给1分。It took 70 hours to complete the game. If the hidden ending is not counted, the total game time is 60 hours. The second review is as follows: First, let's talk about the score. If the plot is not counted, the copywriting is excellent, the pictures are gorgeous, and the music is thoughtful. It can be called a fine game. I give the game 9/10 points as a whole. Because too many lines and copywriting are based on the original ""Journey to the West"", I am willing to give 1 more point（10/10）. 如果只算剧情的话，我愿意直接给出满分。尤其是后三章隐藏剧情，包含（1.八戒感情线{盘丝洞} 2.真假大圣之死{火焰山} 3.踏碎凌霄{解锁真结局}）。这个游戏的立意，格局，深度，在隐藏结局里面得到全面升华。If only the plot is counted, I am willing to give it a full score directly. Especially the hidden plots in the last three chapters, including (1. Bajie's romance plot{Pansi Cave} 2. The death of the real and fake Wukong {Flame Mountain} 3. Killing Erlang{Unlock the true ending}). The concept, pattern, and depth of this game are fully sublimated in the hidden ending.主旨思想一个是偏听则暗，兼听则明，揭示了历史是由胜利者书写但真相无法埋没，只要有天命人执着的追求真相，不断实践，真理永存；还有一个是公平与自由，这两点都与集体主义密不可分，这是一个反压迫的宣传积极斗争的作品。一个人的自由不是自由，集体的自由才是真正的自由。毫无疑问这还是一个反个人英雄主义的作品：天命人在各方势力的帮助和坚持下，真正的大圣才能消解莫须有的罪名，并且让后人真正掌握大圣的意志来为天下人与不公斗争。 The main idea is two, 1.partial listening leads to darkness, and listening to both sides leads to enlightenment. It reveals that history is written by the victors but the truth cannot be buried. As long as there is a destiny, people will pursue the truth persistently and practice it continuously, the truth will last forever; 2. the other is fairness and freedom. These two points are inseparable from collectivism. This is a work of anti-oppression propaganda and call of active struggle. The freedom of one person is not freedom, the freedom of the human kind is the real freedom. There is no doubt that this is also a work against personal heroism: with the help and persistence of various forces, the real Wukong can dispel the false accusation, and let the future generations truly grasp the will of Wukong to fight against injustice for the people of the world. 除此以外，在细节层面，大部分角色的塑造细腻而且具有多面解读性，例如黑熊精，黄风怪，黄眉，毒敌大王，牛魔王，每一处的土地公，乃至于二郎真君和如来佛祖。另外影神图的故事引人入胜，让人不经扼腕叹息如果资源和时间充足的话这个游戏还蕴含着多大的内容，给我们带来多少惊喜。In addition, at the level of details, most of the characters are delicately shaped and have multi-faceted interpretations, such as the black Bear guai, the Yellow Wind Sage, the Yellow brow, Violet Spider, Scorpionlord, the Bull King, the keeper of each place, 4 loongs and even Erlang and all the Buddha. In addition, the story of the Portraits is fascinating, and people can't help but sigh. If there are enough resources and time, how much content this game contains and how many surprises it brings us.纵然是剧情满分作品，游戏内容上还是有两点稍显不足，一个是第六章地图太大，地形辨认困难，找剧情点和找boss浪费大量的时间，导致本来是应该收获很多惊喜的章节硬是被时间给拉成烦躁的感觉，适当缩小地图或者明确一下路线会很棒。另一个是很多大型boss的视角锁定和攻击判定都很奇怪，明明打中了模型却没有触发判定，会产生极大挫败感，比起精彩的动作内容，这一点让人很失望，希望后续可以改良。Even if it is a full-score work in the plot, there are still two points in the game content that are slightly insufficient. One is that the map of Chapter 6 is too large, the terrain is difficult to identify, and a lot of time is wasted to find plot points and bosses, resulting in a chapter that should have been full of surprises being dragged into a feeling of irritability by time. It would be great to appropriately reduce the map or clarify the route. Another thing is that the perspective lock and attack judgment of many large bosses are very strange. It is very frustrating to hit the model but the judgment is not triggered. Compared with the wonderful action content, this is very disappointing. I hope it can be improved in the future.最后，我最喜欢的是天命人在渡船上迎着初升的太阳寻找第六根的那个画面构图，与《太阳照常升起》有异曲同工之妙，套用伟人的话来说：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”Finally, my favorite scene is the picture composition of the man of destiny on the ferry facing the rising sun to find the sixth root. It is similar to ""The Sun Also Rises"". To quote the words of the chairman Mao: ""The world is yours and ours, but in the final analysis, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and vitality and are in a prosperous period, like the sun at eight or nine o'clock in the morning. Hope rests on you.""“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志....下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”""What is work? Work is struggle. There are difficulties and problems in those places, and we need to solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we have to go. This is a good comrade... Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory""我们天命人，都是大圣接班人，在寻找六根的路上，有着各种各样的困难，但这就是我们的工作，我们的工作就是斗争！We, the man of destiny, are all the successors of the Great Sage. On the way to find the six roots, there are all kinds of difficulties, but this is our work, our work is struggle!游戏被称为第九艺术，我认为黑神话悟空当之无愧。排除剧情它是3A大作，加上剧情它是我心目中的4A。Games are called the ninth art, and I think Black Myth: Wukong deserves that title.Excluding the plot, it is a 3A masterpiece, and with the plot, it is a 4A in my mind.从86版西游记到24年黑神话。""三十八年过去，弹指一挥间。""“可上九天揽月，可下五洋捉鳖，谈笑凯歌还。”“金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。今日欢呼孙大圣，只缘妖雾又重来!”"
Positive,"This game is enjoyable. Just enter chapter two, so far great story and experience. This game is a MASTERPIECE!!! Deserve GOTY."
Positive,"For Indian players and those familiar with Hanuman, the game can evoke a sense of connection, seeing the parallels between Wukong’s journey and the tales of Hanuman’s exploits. It’s a testament to how mythology, despite its cultural specificity, can transcend borders and resonate with audiences around the world.Sun Wukong, shares intriguing similarities with another legendary figure from Hindu mythology—Hanuman, the monkey god and devotee of Lord Rama. This connection invites a cross-cultural exploration, highlighting the shared themes and characteristics between these two iconic figures.For fans of action RPGs, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a must-play, setting a new standard for what the genre can achieve. It’s a breathtaking journey through a world steeped in myth and legend, and one that will be remembered for years to come."

Positive,"I'm a noob so I keep dying, but it is really fun to learn the boss's pattern and try different strats. The world levels and monster designs are great, I hope they will release a map tho. It's been many years since I go to bed and I cannot wait to wake up and play a game, this is really refreshing. Also there is a benchmark tool for player to try and see if the game is compatible with their pc, it's free, so try it before purchasing the game. Have fun, everyone!"
Positive,"Insane visuals, very polished, cool mythology/story, great game play, no bugs, no crashes. You can tell this game was a labour of love from the developers, having a blast playing it. Well worth the price."

Positive,I've been having a blast with the game.Got nothing to complain about once I got it working as intended. I had to flash my bios to the latest version to get rid of the AMD issues. Now it's running smooth on a 7600x with 7800XT
Positive,Very well developed and a fun game. I had no issues at all (playing in a i9-14900/ GeForce 4090/ 128 GB DDR5). I could't recomend more. Play it if you have a good setup. You will have hours of fun.Regarding the woke culture that is a plague in the weastern society: I don't care. The game is fun and it works. It's fine by me as a consumer.To the other developers: Learn how to make a good game like this and be honest like the hard working developers of this game. Western society: Stop the bullcrap. We had enough.

Positive,"I pre-ordered a day before release just to get the bonus gourd, which really didn't give any unfair advantage. I also intended on buying it just to try the game and maybe refund it later. However, I'm really glad I didn't and I've been enjoying the game a lot.Black Myth: Wukong is such a great game. The combat flows nicely and perfect dodges are really satisfying. A lot of people thought this would be a Souls-like, however I would rather compare it to the Nioh games as I feel it's more accurate. Enemies respawn whenever you rest at a shrine, you have stances. However in Wukong there's not really any punishment for dying which is a great change of pace, and especially as the game is a boss rush.The voice acting is also really good (I've only played it with Chinese VA and English subtitles), which really helps the setting. I only wish I had read Journey to the West beforehand to get a better grasp of the original story as it doesn't always explain itself."

Positive,"This game is a masterpiece.It has elements of both a souls-like and God of War 2018, blending together to create such a fun experience that I highly recommend giving a go. The only real downside I have is that it could be optimised just that extra bit better, but considering this is the studio's first real attempt at creating such a massive title, I'd say they have more than out done themselves!"
Positive,This game is great and I enjoyed it.. So glad sweet baby didn't touch this game at all.
Positive,GAME OF THE YEAR
Positive,"Having a lot of fun with this game.  Runs ok on steam deck on low settings as well with some tweaking.  I am about 4 hours into the game, and beaten a couple of the bosses.  The only thing I have an issue with is the combat is a bit boring after a while as I so far only have the staff and there isn't any variety like having other weapons besides different upgrades and skins for the staff.  Maybe that changes later in the game, but so far there is no indication of it.  This game is fun, and I recommend it if you like a dark souls type game.  It is similar to that, Jedi Fallen Order, and God of War being it's the same type of game but Chinese mythology instead of Greek/Norse mythology.  Overall 8/10."
Positive,"the most greatest one, only"
Positive,"Wish there is no invisible walls around the maps, overall a great game."
Positive,"Really a wonderful game, the story in really great, combat is fun to play. Just want an open world version of this game because it's too good ..."
Positive,"Fantastic game, difficult at times but really good. Especially the sexy Monkey Tits"
Positive,BEST GAME EVER HANDS DOWN
Positive,"The game is absolutely gorgeous, action is very fluid and satisfying, and provides a great challenge for those who love soulslikes while also providing insane action moments for those who God of War"
Positive,I am really enjoying the story and considering this is the first game of the studio it is good. It will improve in further instalments.
Positive,i like this game
Positive,"I never bought a big game in day one or pre order, but for this game, i bought this game pre order to fight with f*cking woke lghtv agenda in games industry. The game itself is less harder than sekiro, but not too easy to make you bored, at least i love the animation and facial face that so damn smooth, dev game like this is the one that give effort to gamer that their want this game to be loved."
Positive,"Amazing beautiful scene. Super cool boss & creature design. The story of this game is a masterpiece with width and depth . Especially each character  even the unimportant one  has a funny story which might be connected to the story background or reflected some funny facts about people and society. What's most important is that the creativity of action design(like some kung fu) and fabulous artistic design(historic sculptures, murals, Chinese paintings, costume, cartoon etc.) of this game sharing intriguing Chinese culture to this world. THIS GAME IS DEFINITELY WORTH PLAYING!!!!!!!!!!"
Positive,"One of the best Worlds and Story to explore. It makes you wish it was open world to experience even more of the beautiful, crafted creating. Im really glad that there are still studios and ppl making Art and things that they personally enjoy and want to make and not will make the most money or what the loudest voices want, the Success will come from a good Product no matter what. Now back to the Game…The combat is pretty snappy and the stance changes give you enough changes and altering attacks to experiment and try different things. The Bosses are crafted very well, even better than expected, very polished and interesting challenges. The only downside are the performance issues, but it doesn't take away from the overall experience. 9,5/10 my bet for GoTY"
Positive,The art and visual design of this game are stunning. The action design is excellent. Brought some really authentic ancient Chinese myths and cultures. Can't believe it's the first game of the studio. Deserve GOTY nomination for sure.
Positive,"When I was a young boy frankerface my buddy told me ""Hero is he alone who vies with powers supreme!"" I hold that quote with me although my buddy frankerface couldn't join me on the my journey I use what he said to become the Black Myth....Wukong"
Positive,"This review is positive for 2 reasons:1. The game slaps HARD, and is easily GOTY material2. This is a giant F U to companies like IGN, Screen Rant, and Sweet Baby Inc. Hey guys! You wanted some diversity? Here you go - pick any of these 🙈🙉🙊 and shove it up some place dark and warm!"

Even surpassed Counter-Strike 2. Remember boys and girls, this is the very first RPG created by a tiny studio. What makes it so great? Well, the fact that the game's creators and developers decided to stay true to their way of making the game without letting any OUTSIDE influencers influence their decision-making. This proves that you don't need to give money to any Western companies so that they can input their ideas into your game. That is what makes this game so great."

Positive,"Like WuKong, the bag of tricks is what makes the game shine.despite the concerns, I did not encounter any bugs. However, i did encounter a crash at the prologue, simple switch off ray tracing, motion blur and graphic settings to Low to overcome the crash. Thereafter, switch it back to ur PC capabilities and voila."
Positive,"The gameplay is good and smooth, the visuals are nice and I've experienced no frame drops or stuttering (unlike certain other similar titles *cough cough* Jedi Survivor *cough cough*).So with that said, buy the game and return to monke."
Positive,"While I don't have a lot of hours in game as of writing this review, I still want to write it because I think I've seen enough to know this is going to be a great game.I've been waiting for this game for years. I don't know why but it always attracted me, maybe because of it's spectacular graphics that Game Science, the studio behind Black Myth Wukong showcased so much in their game play trailers, when a studio flex so much by constantly showing game play trailers instead of cinematic trailers, you know they are confident about their product.Black Myth Wukong is a Chinese mythology loosely based on the 16th century Chinese novel Journey to the West which tells the tale of a Sun Wukong (aka Monkey King). I won't go into details of the story but it's full of mythical creatures, locations, and rich lore that is begging to be explored and this game is one of the best way to compliment the novel. To understand the story better I recommend reading Journey to the West first but it's not really required.Black Myth Wukong is the prime example of what a developer could do if they have great vision and passion for video games. Despite coming from a relatively small Chinese studio with smaller budget than most AAA games we see these days from the likes of EA, Ubisoft and others, it not only looks amazing but it's also a feature complete single player game with tons of content and no crap like paid DLC, micro transactions and so on.It takes some inspiration from Souls games but I think it would be unfair to call it a Soulslike because it's definitely not. It does have clever boss designs, stamina management and some other known elements but this is where the similarity ends. The combat feels more like Wu Long Fallen Dynasty fused with God of War and presented in slick looking animations. So far I have defeated 4 bosses and while 3 were manageable, one felt more particularly difficult so it's likely that you'll see bosses of varying difficulty levels and some could lead to frustrating moments but players of Souls games will understand the fight fairly quickly. It's a bit heck'n'slash style of combat but not a complete button masher, in fact too much button mashing will lead to death but there are moments where you have to pick been planning and button mashing to quickly drain the health of your enemies, some skills allow you to freeze or distract the boss where you can take advantage of quick attacks.Perhaps the strongest area of this game is the art style and the world presented in breathtaking graphics, it's been a while a game looked this impressive after Crysis first came out on PC. It's very demanding on PC but I think the graphics totally justify it's high requirements. If you face problems running it with consistent performance I recommend disabling ray tracing for now, even with high end cards like a 4090 it could lead to some performance issues. I think it will take few patches for ray tracing to run a bit better just like Hogwarts Legacy.But even without ray tracing it looks absolutely beautiful and just the opening cinematic of the game is better than what majority of AAA games show you these days.World exploration wise it felt fairly linear in my starting hours but maybe that will change as I will progress, the world has some intricate paths that you can easily skip if you don't explore but I kind of like it because it's not open world where you can get lost completely and get distracted from the main story but having some small hidden areas gives you enough distraction to keep you intrigued not to mention such areas could lead to valuable treasure as well.Also having no map is a risky thing in a game like this but for now I think it's working out for me because it's forcing me to explore out of curiosity and the beautiful world design encourages exploration. Maybe if the world gets too big later on then having no map might end up frustrating but so far it's good.The game also gives you RPG like customisation like armour, weapon, etc. It also features a decent skill tree that allows you to learn new skills, spells, stances, and improve your chances of survival.Other elements like sound, music, controls, UI design are top notch as well. I think the only thing that might lead to some frustration is the fact that some difficult bosses will kill you couple of times and the distance from the shrine (rest location) could be a bit longer than desirable but if you're okay with traversing and killing few small enemies multiple times before trying your luck with the boss again then I think you'll be fine, at least there is no penalty associated with dying so that makes it a bit easier than Souls games.All and all Black Myth Wukong is a rare gem that you don't see every day and it's hard to do justice to it with words alone so I recommend you guys try it out yourself. I should also mention that after the crazy smearing campaign by journalists to take this game down, I feel good that it found the success it deserved. Congratulations to Game Science and I hope we see more games like this in future."

Positive,"The game is super fun, very linear story and path to follow, with exciting combat and interesting boss fights. I'm really enjoying the progression and skills so far. A lot of people are expecting this to be a souls-like, when the only big similarities are the resting points that respawn enemies and heal you, along with some similarity in the combat."

Positive,MONKE GAME FUN!!
Positive,"The game content is really great, can be described as amazing. But the disadvantages are also very obvious, there are air walls everywhere on the edge of the map in the game, this shortcoming greatly reduces the gaming experience. I can only say that as China's first truly 3A game, it is a great game. But Game Science still needs to accumulate more experience in the details. Come on, Chinese 3A games! Come on Game Science! (I still want a minimap:))"
Positive,"Aside form two, weird out of the blue crashes no performance issues so far. Game is, like many already said in their reviews  kinda like a mix of God of War and soulslike, bosses are really good, animations superb, crafting system is good, can only recommend buying this game and supporting this studio. Oh and also lack of inclusivity and diversity( not a bad thing =) )"

Positive,Woke journalists experiencing their own 9/11.
Positive,Ah yes. Monkey
Positive,"The game plays very well and is a rare solid day one release.  Runs great on steam deck, can even tune it to almost 60 FPS when turning down scaling.  Boss fights are remisniscent of Fromsoft while also remaining unique.  My biggest gripe would be the way the edges of the environments are defined.  Some things that look traversable are not, but in another area the exact same looking area is indeed traversable.  Gripe 2 would be that the areas between bosses are fairly easy/low risk.  And without the risk of losing your XP it kind of takes a lot of the ""pulse-pounding"" out of it for me.  However, dont let that discourage you from playing!   Its a WHOLE lot of fun, and im a Souls SNOB!!!"
Positive,"I really like this Chinese mythology background and intriguing story. The is nearly empty on the market right now. especially it is generally well-crafted, with an engaging narrative and compelling characters. AndHowever, there are a couple of noticeable drawbacks. a. The frequent use of linear camera and movement mechanics during non-boss battles can cause varying degrees of dizziness for players who are not seasoned gamers. b. The map design seems to be caught between an open-world experience and more confined, boxy environments. This is further complicated by the lack of clear exploration guidelines and the overuse of invisible barriers.Despite these issues, the game is still good enough, for now. The diverse character designs, well-developed storylines, and impressive combat sequences elevate this game beyond the typical standard of Chinese games, making it an exciting and memorable experience."

They don't even care about the lives of the professionals involved in the project just because they think everyone has to agree to put ""woke materials"" on everything. The game is 10/10 :)."
Positive,"(This will be updated as i continue to play through the game, this is after finishing chapter 1)This one was unexpected, I honestly thought this game would be bad, I was VERY wrong.Black Myth Wukong, is AWESOME. Its stunning to look at, optimized well, it makes my 4080 GPU cry a little but that's okay (full raytracing at 3440x2560 resolution at max settings will do that) Combat is STUPID FUN, think dark souls/sekiro/ninja gaiden/DMC. Its well-paced, flows like water, and every hit feels crunchy. The way the character moves is fantastic, great animations, and feels agile as MONKE should. Transformations and spells: Transformations are badass, they are a limited time thing where u can transform into certain bosses you kill, the one I have has unique abilities that cause burning. You also unlock what I call ""mini transformations"" with these u have a wide variety of different moves depending on which one u pick, example: I can turn into a large frog that does a wide tongue sweep (there are way more but I won't spoil them) u can use these on  the fly with a cool down, fantastic.Stances: if u have played Ghosts of tsushima it's kinda like that, u can change these on the fly too, and they offer different ways to approach combat, ecample: u can sit on top of your bonk stick and then fly down with devastating overhead slam, or use the stick to spin around and hit multiple enemies. Cinematics: Very cool, the in game ones are great, BUT the absolutely beautifully drawn ones at the end of chapters are AMAZING, Really cool stuff.Worth buying? Absolutely if you're a fan of Dark souls/Sekiro/Elden ring like i am, OR you like action combat games like Ninja gaiden, or Devil May Cry, you will like this. Also, if you like old school kung fu movies like I do you will also like this because of its subtle humour, and over the top scenes with a little bit of cringy fun dialogue."
Positive,"I'm OK with LGBTQ+ people whom exist, what thing are you believe you are doesn't matter. BUT this game, this game or this story that should't have those element, as it suppose to be. Those who think every game should include LGBT elements, and ignore the story it self should be, DELETE THIS GAME AND GO FUCK YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!"
Positive,"Amazing graphics, combat is very fun for someone who never even plays action RPG; it's not as hard yet still challenging. I'm very intrigued with the plot too, eager to find out the ultimate goal. However, I will not rush the game, I want to take it slow to appreciate its beauty."

Positive,This game is art
Positive,This is a beautiful game with interesting skills and machanics. the story is great and compelling. The intro was out of this world also.
Positive,If this game aint GOTY 2025 it would be rigged asf
Positive,This game is an massive middle finger to the SBI and woke culture and that is good
Positive,"Very good boss rush, sending love from Mount Huaguo"
Positive,"I am on the 2nd Chapter and am about 10 Hours into the game. I have to say the customizable armour and weapons all look amazing and have unique attributes. Without spoiling anything the ""magic"" aspect of this game is as addictive as creating all of these potions / gathering.What is the game like?| 2/10 - Souls-like  |  8/10 - Cinematic Action Fantasy RPG =  10/10 Fun and Immersive"
Positive,"Ummmmm... Amazing, simply a beautiful masterpiece and a wonderful continuation of the famous Chinese folklore. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a challenging souls-like god of war type Chinese folklore monkey smashing good time!"
Positive,"Very fun, challenging at times. 100% Worth the money"
Positive,cool monkey know how to fight. good game
Positive,worth the 6 year wait.
Positive,Monkey Kong Smash
Positive,Funny monkey game
Positive,"This is what every souls like wishes they were. It can be forgiving but the style, story, graphics, all of it. Boss fights don't seem tedious just challenging in a competitive way. There's not many minions between boss fights. It feels like an anime battle without the guilt of feeling like a weeb.10/10"
Positive,"nice gamefurry boss rush with really good graphics.game is easy af, some bosses are harder but its nothing compared to soulslike games (only soulslike difficulty level boss is erlang the sacred divinity (not his tutorial version)).time slowing down on perfect dodge is cool mechanic and dodges are just really forgiving. you can spam dodge backwards and usually u wont get hit.the worst thing about this game is world design. you will find invincible walls everywhere and its unacceptable in 2024. idk why they are trying to make this game look like open world.but still ELDEN RING <3 is 2 years old but its just a better game. BUT if u want easier game to relax without being stuck for 6 hours at 1 boss fight then wukong is fantastic. ELDEN RING DLC IS THE ONLY AND TRUE GOTY (i know its dlc not a game but i dont care, its goty in my heart)"
Positive,"Epic game with a  captivating story and some of the best graphics I've ever seen. The world feels vibrant and alive, the combat is both fun and challenging, and the boss fights are outstanding—easily on par with games like Elden Ring, if not better. If you’re into any of that, this game is an absolute must-play!"
Positive,God of War + Elden Ring + Jedi Fallen Order = Monke/10
Positive,liiittttlle easy but brill game
Positive,monkey goes bonk!
Positive,"10/10 game for just raw action game enjoyers, if you read Journey to the West its even better. Every single fight is so cinematic and memorable. They just nailed it, no doubt about it. P.S possibly the coolest tutorial/opening cinematic in gaming history."
Positive,"I belong to ARPG newbies. Previously, I only played ""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"" for two hours. ""Black Myth: Wukong"" was my first ARPG that I fully immersed myself in playing. I finished the first chapter on the night of its release and look forward to the journey ahead!!!我算是ARPG新手，之前《只狼：影逝二度》只玩了两个小时就没玩了， 《黑神话：悟空》是我第一款完全沉浸下去玩的ARPG，首发当晚勉强打完了第一章，期待后面的旅程！！！"
Positive,"This game blew out all of my expectations.  I was honestly even expecting a unoptimized, buggy launch of it. But no, not at all.  Ran into no bugs at all so far, its optimized and polished, able to run it at 4k 120fps balance settings on my rig, 4k 90fps in Quality settings.  Its extremely gorgeous, the controls are fast and rock solid, so far im having a easy time with it, not a single boss during my first 6 hours has given me much, if any trouble, basically one shotted them all, but I came from playing games like Elden Ring, Sekiro, Bloodborne, Nioh, and Rise of the Ronin, so I have experience with these types of games.  Everything is just, beautiful, this is how the Unreal Engine 5, should be used *Unlike the travesty that is Ark Survival Ascended* they even got the Frame Generation working right, most games cant even do that without the UI going berserk, but here? No issues.  Not even a single crash.  This game, deserves, Game of the Year.  No contest. Believe me, I am usually very strict, on the games I review, you can tell from most of my reviews being negative.  But this?  This game?  Masterpiece.  Well done Game Science."

Positive,Return to monke
Positive,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" is an extraordinary and visually arresting masterpiece that immerses players in a rich tapestry of Chinese mythology, deeply rooted in the ancient folklore of the ""Journey to the West."" The game's breathtaking graphics, coupled with its intricate and meticulously designed gameplay mechanics, create an unparalleled experience that seamlessly blends both action and narrative.The developers have demonstrated an exceptional commitment to authenticity, paying homage to the source material with a reverence that will resonate deeply with those familiar with the classic tale. The protagonist, Sun Wukong, is brought to life with a complexity and depth that is as mesmerizing as it is formidable, embodying the duality of his mischievous and heroic nature.However, to truly appreciate the profound intricacies and cultural nuances embedded within ""Black Myth: Wukong,"" I would emphatically recommend that players acquaint themselves with ""Journey to the West"" beforehand. This foundational knowledge will significantly enhance one’s comprehension of the narrative subtleties and the mythological references that permeate the game, allowing for a more profound and immersive experience.Yours truly,ChatGPT"
Positive,"As a Chinese person, I am very proud of this game.  The game's overall quality, game-play mechanics, content, and system are truly outstanding. From a purely gaming perspective, this is an exceptionally well-made and enjoyable game 10 out of 10! Please believe me, even if you have no knowledge of Journey to the West, you will still really enjoy this game."
Positive,Reject modernity. Go play the monke.
Positive,"Great game so far. I think some of the enemies would give ""The Flash"" a  run for his money...."
Positive,"As someone from Beijing and a fellow gamer, this game felt like a dream to me, as I read ""Journey to the West"" when I was in 8th grade. In a time when most triple A titles failed to deliver, it is games like this making me believe that there is still hope in the industry.Everyone else already talked about the positives, so here are some problems I noticed:-Some performance issues, ranging from minor lagging frame rate to some noticeable lagging even when fighting-Map design is not perfect, chapter 2 is hard to navigate without a map, I think this is more of a chapter 2 issue because I had no trouble navigating chapter 1-The game is Chinese audience oriented, and I can feel that if you are not familiar with Chinese cultures and ancient Chinese literature, you will miss out on 50% of the content-Game is hard AF, but I feel it's easier than Dark Souls, plus I suck at Soul-like games"
Positive,"Just finished the first chapter. So far it’s enjoyable, despite that I died countless times. I’m not a hardcore action game player but an average PC gamer, and last time I died so many times in a game was in Witcher 3. But the experience was not frustrating. With the really nice shading and beautiful art assets, I’m immersed in the world and willing to explore.I’m actually happy to hit invisible walls when I was hesitated at the beginning which way should I explore first and what I could have missed. I know some people prefer open world, but to me without any map, guided path is a bless and relief.I do see some frame drops from time to time but to be fair, I’m running all highest cinematic quality with RTX on at 110+ fps on average. Those lagging never caused crash and I never missed a hit because of that, so I don’t have much to complain on that.The skill system is friendly which allows you to reset points for free. Not hard to understand. And few games on the market developed such a special stick weapon system.The music also contains a variety of authentic Chinese style components, instead of those imagined “oriental style” that I’m tired of. That’s not very common."
Positive,"Just in the first hour of playing this game it's already visually stunning. The opening sequence is definitely setting the tone of the style of the game. If you use cinematic in the graphics setting with ray tracing on it's truly astonishing how the world looksReview after finishing the game:The unique way of storytelling about Wukong is wonderfully told within the game, with each chapter following up with the an animated cinematic.Gameplay wise I've never seen a boss used twice and all of them were pretty unique and the combat feels fluid. The game gives you many ways to play with different styles as you like, but what it doesn't do is free exploring the world. Some times it looks like you can go places but then get stumbled upon a invisible wall.Nowadays it's also very rare to find a full complete game which is actually finished and that for a competent retail price.The game is so gorgeous and optimized without crashing once.This proves that there's actually a finished product as trailers will show you.With a review score of Overwhelmingly Positive over 550k+ rating, that's an achievement to behold.This game is a seriously GOTY contenderI see no reason to not pickup this game"
Positive,Go Apeshit Wooo WooooW ooo
Positive,"Fun game, slight stutter upon launch but it works well after about 3 minutes.Would be better with some form of map tho, even without a minimap."
Positive,I am having so much fun with this game right now
Positive,the game has multiple monkeys in it
Positive,very good already Goty after 5 hours of playing might even be as good as elden ring
Positive,"As a wise old turtle once said, ""Mmm, monke..."""
Positive,insane graphics and gameplay PEEEEAAAAAK
Positive,"Reject DEI, return to monke"
Positive,"visually pleasing, satisfying combat"
Positive,"Soooo in the books they keep describing the Monkey King as ""handsome"" and I thought it was really weird as a kid. But I think I know why now..........ANYWAYS - as a disclaimer: I have immense skill issues with souls-like games. I really want to play souls games, they look super fun and usually the aesthetics they have are my type of thing (Bloodborne, Lies of P, Elden Ring). So it sucks I can't play through these games without just feeling frustrated for some reason. :( When I got Black Myth, I didn't think I'd like this one so much, but I really really loved the look of it and the fact it's exploring The Journey to the West in a way I haven't seen before in a video game. I also heard it wasn't a complete ""souls"" game, so I took the gamble. And love it! I think it just hits the right amount of challenge for me (who sucks at these kind of games). I do love the fast-past game play, the variety of abilities, the satisfaction of a perfect dodge. I was weary of stances, cause I thought it'll take me too much brain power to figure out, but they're fun to mess around with! So far the bosses have so much variety, which is amazing judging with how many this game has. The character/creature designs are phenomenal, since it's based in Chinese Mythology it's super exciting to just see new, strange monsters that I've never seen in a AAA game before. Kudos to Game Science for working so hard on this game to bring Chinese Mythology to mainstream! Hope to see it inspire more :)Not to mention, it's an insanely gorgeous game. And I'm a big sucker for pretty games. I'm only running this on a 4070 but now I want a 4090 to REALLY see it haha. Also, thank god for the meditation spots, cause lord knows I need it after sweatin' so much. So yea! If you have skill issues like me, I would say give it a try! Also. Embrace the monke."
Positive,It's a must-play. Simple as that.
Positive,"Just finished the first chapter and can happily say after the first 4 hours game play Black Myth Wukong is a quality game. The game it self looks beautiful and the game play feels smooth and well though out. Many will say it soul like and that is true to a certain extent. However, don't be put off by this. The game offers a gap in between souls like and an RPG adventure game. Yes some of the bosses are challenging but not to the standard of souls games which allows the casual player to pick it up and play. So don't be scared because people say its souls like., give it ago you'll enjoy it.The only negative I could say is that the game could do with a little more to the levels to allow a bigger gap between bosses. Sometime it feels like a boss rush which some people many not enjoy. Finally the game is 100% worth the money. We all know its hard to say this in 2024 as a good game is hard to come by. This is one of them good games.  BUY IT!!!!!"
Positive,"BLACK Myth WU Kong is epic, big flex i ordered the Deluxe like 2 months before it came out, was it worth it?? so far yes the best way i can describe the game is like this, Imagine BAYONETTA and MONSTER HUNTER WORLD had a BABY black myth wukong is this baby and dark souls is his uncle the game is not difficult but it does have some soulslike elements its mostly like the 2 hack n slash games i mentioned earlier the dodging mechanics = bayonetta incarnate, combat too, its also like Monster hunter world the control scheme is almost identical lmao there are even scout flies! right bumper to sprint xD love it! you can also switch styles! like dmc! lol im only 2 hours in and i beat both bosses first try epic anyway the game is great so far the story cant be complained about coz its based on journey to the west, is it worth it right now?? idk it depends on your budget, so play skyrim until it goes on sale lol thats it, JESUS LOVES YOU AND HIS GRACE IS SUFFICIENT ! 2 CORINTHIANS 12:9"
Positive,"Magic Monkey Makes Mythic Melee's. Magical Mayhem, Masterful Metamorphosis, Monstrous Marauders, Majestic Mysteries. Momentous Marches."
Positive,WUKONG MY GOAT!
Positive,"Very fun and not that punishing. Has souls-like elements, but not to the extent of which the game becomes cruel or unusual. You can tell that the focus is on having fun and overcoming challenges without trying to make you also feel despair at the same. Overall a fun game if you have any interest in souls-likes or even God of War."
Positive,"Game Review:Many people label Black Myth: Wukong as a ""Souls-like"" game, but I find that description a bit misleading. The game doesn't have death penalties or a cryptic narrative. In my view, Black Myth: Wukong is more of an action RPG focused on intense boss battles, with a heavier emphasis on RPG elements compared to typical action games. It features a leveling system, gear and equipment sets, transformation abilities, and more. So, if you enjoy challenging different bosses and savoring each fight, I believe you'll really like this game. If you find certain bosses too tough, you can always level up and come back to face them—the difficulty can be adjusted by improving the character’s stats.Pros:1. The combat is top-tier in my experience. The fluidity of the actions and the epic BGM make every boss fight thrilling and enjoyable.2. The environmental design is absolutely unique. Many of the buildings and item models have real-world counterparts, and it’s inspired me to start planning a Black Myth: Wukong themed trip across China to see them in person.3. The lock-on system is a standout. Compared to the frustrating lock-on mechanics in Elden Ring, Black Myth’s boss fight camera is smooth and responsive, making the experience much more enjoyable.Cons:1. The abundance of detailed visual assets ironically detracts from the exploration experience. The realistic color palette makes it difficult to distinguish different areas, leading to poor map readability. While it’s not impossible to navigate, the process is visually exhausting and feels like a strain on the eyes.2. The presence of numerous invisible walls negatively impacts the experience. Some areas look accessible but are blocked off, while others that seem unreachable are actually passable. This inconsistency forces you into a trial-and-error approach whenever you reach the edges of the map, disrupting the flow of exploration.Overall:This is a ""solid"" single-player purchase—neither flawless nor overwhelmingly negative. However, considering the landscape of the Chinese gaming industry, where most resources go to mobile games and online games, having a “normal” game like this is quite a rare gem. The development team clearly went through their own “81 difficulties” to bring this project to life.Now let's discuss cultural, diversity and inclusivity:Imagine growing up immersed in a mythological tale since childhood, exposed to countless versions of it across various cultural mediums—be it the original novel, children's picture books, animations, TV series, movies, music, MMORPGs, comedies, and more. Now, imagine that same cherished myth being reimagined as a modern AAA video game. The excitement you would feel is exactly how I felt playing Black Myth: Wukong. The experience was nothing short of magical, especially when the familiar Journey to the West melodies from my childhood were beautifully reinterpreted in the game. The nostalgia mixed with the impressive modernization left me absolutely thrilled.In my view, cultural diversity and inclusivity are both important and reasonable. I’m happy to explore Greek mythology through Hades and Norse mythology through God of War—these, to me, are treasures that go beyond obvious labels like race, gender, or skin color. Now, there’s a game developed by a Chinese team that uses modern technology to bring Chinese mythology to life in a way that no one has ever done before. In a gaming market primarily dominated by Western and Japanese titles, this is a true example of diversity. In the future, I hope to see more games and creations from teams in other countries, allowing us to explore the myths, histories, and stories of different cultures. So, who exactly is saying that this game is lacking in inclusivity and diversity?After reading the English translation of Journey to the West, I couldn’t help but feel that there’s still a significant loss in the original meaning and essence. I’m not entirely confident in how much of the story’s depth can be conveyed through the text in this game, but I hope that every player can enjoy a delightful Journey to the West experience through it.很多人说黑猴子是魂like游戏，但我觉得这种说法并不完全准确。游戏没有死亡惩罚，也没有晦涩难懂的剧情。在我看来黑猴子更像是注重boss对战的AROG，它的数值强度占比还是很高的，有等级系统、装备、套装奖励、变身系统。所以如果是喜欢与不同的Boss对战，享受每一场挑战，我想你会喜欢这款游戏。如果遇到实在打不过的Boss，可以去提升等级再回来挑战，因为游戏难度可以通过主角的数值来调节。优点：1. 战斗体验非常流畅，动作和背景音乐的配合让我在每一场Boss战中都感到乐趣十足。2. 场景美术独一无二。我现在就想圣地巡礼！3. 我必须说，锁定视角的体验非常流畅舒适！相较于艾尔登法环糟糕的锁定系统，这里的Boss战锁定体验简直起飞缺点：1. 过于丰富的美术资源反而让跑图体验变得有些糟糕，写实的色彩运用导致地图辨识度低。虽然我并不会迷路，但跑图的过程确实感到累且伤眼。2. 空气墙的存在影响了游戏体验。有些地方看似能到达却被空气墙阻挡，而当我以为都是空气墙时，有些地方又可以通过。这种不一致性导致我在地图边缘处只能不断尝试是否能通过。总体来说，这是一款“正常”的单机买断制3A游戏，既有明显的优点也有缺点。但是就是这样正常的普通的游戏，在现在这个市场来说，究竟有多不容易，我想玩游戏很多的老ass们都门儿清"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is visually stunning, I love the way the devs captured the beauty in the surrounding landscapes, I think the devs knew this game was beauty because of the different viewpoints that are littered throughout the game.  The combat feels very good, took me some time to get use to since I've never played a souls game and this game greatly took inspiration from the souls genre as this is the common theme in modern action adventure games. The only issue I have with combat is there is no block/parrying system so you have to time your dodging precisely and master the perfect dodging system if you're going to progress in this game.  The boss fights can be challenging at times but it will make you want to respec your character and use different equipment combinations to find the right build to adapt to the bosses.  There has really only been two issues I have come across so far; 1) I have experienced some hitching in the 4 hours I've played thus far but I think it was my graphics card that was causing the hitching cause once I turned down my graphics a bit the problem went away.  The second issue I've experienced was the audio will randomly get extremely low and sound muffled.  I've been waiting for this game for 3 years ever since I saw the first trailer and Black Myth: Wukong has greatly exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend this game to anybody who loves action-adventure games, Souls/Souls-like games, and for people who understand the lore of the Journey to the West."

Game of the Year award for sure."
Positive,Awesome game Monke/10
Positive,game of the year
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is one of the greatest games I've ever played.The story is told in incredible beautiful stories and as you progress through the game everything pieces together, after each chapter/area, you are rewarded with some of the finest game design and it all culminates into a masterpiece.The combat is just something else, although you don't have a variety of weapons like Elden Ring, you do however get access to a huge skill pool where you can perform amazing combo's and it's just so insanely polished you are right off the bat blown away even by the first boss enemy you encounter. The bosses are something else, perfectly designed no bullshit mechanics or stuff which makes things unfun, if you're struggling with a boss there are so many things in place to help you beat the boss and progress. The bosses are challenging but incredibly fun, I found myself trying again and again on certain bosses but never getting frustrated or anything because the animations, the music the moves just bring it all to life and blow me away.The graphics/scenery are just breathtaking, sure unreal engine 5 looks incredible but the love and passion put into painstakingly crafting each area is something you don't see in other games. The attention to detail across the board is something that only people who put their soul into the game would be able to achieve and although performance is not great on PC it will hopefully improve as Denuvo is eventually removed.My absolute game of the year. 10/10If you're on the wall about getting this, then all I can say is please do, you absolutely won't regret it."

However, bosses are difficult enough to offer a challenge and may leave you with a few deaths until you are successful. The bosses have amazing details and never feel the same combat has been recycled, they're all unique and offer engaging, enjoyable fights."
Positive,"Absolutely the best game I have ever played. Graphics and combat is simply peak. Also as a huge fan of Journey to the West growing up, this game has brought back such nostalgia that the music is probably (for me) the best part of this game. Celestial Symphony OST is just so so good."
Positive,"As someone who has watched the original Journey to the West TV-series (from 1986?), this game truly touches my heart. The art direction, the track, the combat and the world design... I fell in love with it since the very first trailer. After have played the game for 2 hours, I'd say it exceeded my expectation. The execution of the project was top-tier. The result quality is high and the gameplay is smooth and enjoyable. The ray-traced ambient occulsion is an unexpected bonus, it simply looks amazing. What I would like to see in the future patches:- As others have mentioned, the invisible walls do break the immersion a bit, especially in places where they are unnecessary (imho).- The difficulty could be higher xD."

Positive,"Reject modernity, Embrace monkey"
Positive,"Spread the word ""MONKE""It is so freaking enjoyable that I'm being rattled by ""wandering wight"". Having a blast replaying same boss over 100 times, now onto the 101th attempt.Anyways, Game is MONKE-FULOUS. Incredible visuals. Although my 4090 was behaving like an OVAN apparently when I toggled FULL RAY TRACING.10/10 Game for sure though! Quite fun!"
Positive,"The fighting system is fantastic! The boss is hard to hunt down, but they always have weakness, you need to find a wise strategy and build. Have to say that the artwork is going to be the Greatest of All Time.Can not wait to see 'BLACK MYTH WUKONG 2'. ( based on the selling of this game, it is likely)If the developer would add the map designing like what in ElderRing, it would be GOAT game."
Positive,"Imagine, an AAA game with stunning graphics, extremely satisfying combat and interesting environmental design releases. On day 1 it has no performance problems and no major bugs. It also features no microtransactions. This game is Black Myth: Wukong.With each chapter game keeps getting better and better (excluding chapter 5). New systems keep unlocking and combat keeps getting more varied as your combos improve and bosses become more and more fun to fight. Honestly the combat in Wukong is one of the best and most satisfying combat systems out there. Another highlight of the game is the music, it just fits so well. So far I wasn't able to find even a single flaw in the game. All the systems just make sense and there is no jankiness that one could expect from a recently released game.As for the souls-like tag, I find it hard to agree. If anything Wukong is a souls-lite. There is a few similarities mainly the stamina based combat and bonefires which heal you, restore your estus and respawn enemies, but that's where the similarities end. Combat is much more dynamic with little to no animation locks, you don't lose souls on death, leveling is done via XP and there is no equipment load mechanic. One more similarity is the way quests are handled. It's the same cryptic way of conveying information. Like in Dark Souls 1, there is no markers, no map, no quest books.Difficulty in Wukong is a mixed bag. For the first 3 chapters it keeps going up at a nice pace, but then in the middle of chapter 4 it drops so much. After killing Yellow Loong (who took many tries), each following boss felt like a joke and could be cleared on the first try or at most in 2-3 tries. I was very surprised when I realized that some random boss which barely did anything was the final boss of chapter 4. Due to the nature of semi-open world it is possible to do the bosses in different order which would make it so bosses I found challenging would be easy for someone that took a different route. Additionally different builds will struggle with different bosses. For example I keep seeing ""The Scorpionlord"" and ""Hundred-Eyed Daoist"" being mentioned as some of the most difficult bosses while for me they would barely make it into the top 20.Another thing is the fact some bosses are optional. Someone who cleared all of the bosses will have more mind cores and will be higher level. By the time you reach chapter 5 your build should be mostly finalized and having 100%ed the previous 4 chapters it's possible to simply out-scale most of the difficulty. Overall the game is slightly challenging. It's definitely not a game you can recommend to your grandma, but for someone that plays action games Wukong shouldn't pose much of a challenge (except for a handful of bosses).My ranking of most difficult bosses (totally subjective and build dependent):1. Erlang - The secret final fight of the game is definitely the most epic and most difficult one. This was the only boss for which I had to change my build, after doing so I was able to beat him in 3 tries.2. Yellow Loong [Ch.4] - Cleared right after Buddah's Left Hand and it was definitely the most challenging fight in the game (excluding secret final boss). Took almost an hour to clear with most tries ending before I could even get him down to 50%.3. Yin Tiger (Blacksmith Challenge) [Ch.3] - Cleared it right after turtle island section. It felt like this was a later game fight, but the satisfaction of beating him was definitely worth the hour it took.4. Yellow Wind Sage [Ch.2] - This fight would be definitely easier had I not skipped 50% of the chapter. While trying to beat him I did not know it was the final boss of the chapter so I didn't bother clearing the rest of the chapter and as a result I was severely under-level.5. Cyan Loong [Ch.3] - Cleared before main boss on turtle island. This fight's main challenge was the damage output of the boss. Each hit would deal 50-60% of my HP so I had to learn the attack pattern. It was legit one of the best fights in the game and it felt incredible to finally kill him almost hit-less with all gourd charges left.To sum up, Black Myth: Wukong is a ray of hope for AAA games. I wish more studios were able to deliver such a high quality product that actually works day 1 and isn't just a cashgrab in disguise. Can't wait for DLC or sequel."

Positive,"I am not going to take too much of your time, do yourself a favor and buy this game!  It is absolutely worth every penny, these guys knocked it out of the park with this title.  It is so different and refreshing with a bit of what your familiar with in this type of genera that it feels like nothing else you have played.  The fighting is so fluid and rewarding.  10 out of 10 for me."
Positive,"Visually stunning, close to realistic and really interesting spin off to the Journey to the West story. Sun Wukong always has been my childhood OP hero watched on TV.Would recommend to play if you have a machine that can tank the graphics.So far I only encounter a single crash after prologue, after that just skipped the prologue to avoid the crash. Afterwards, no more crashes and the game runs very smoothly."
Positive,愿这部杰作标志着中国游戏行业新时代的到来。May this masterpiece mark the dawn of a new era in the Chinese gaming industry.この傑作が中国ゲーム業界の新時代の幕開けとなりますように。이 걸작이 중국 게임 산업의 새로운 시대의 시작이 되기를 바랍니다.Möge dieses Meisterwerk den Beginn einer neuen Ära in der chinesischen Spieleindustrie markieren.Que ce chef-d'œuvre marque le début d'une nouvelle ère dans l'industrie du jeu vidéo en Chine.Que esta obra maestra marque el comienzo de una nueva era en la industria de los videojuegos en China.Que esta obra-prima marque o início de uma nova era na indústria de jogos chinesa.Пусть этот шедевр ознаменует начало новой эпохи в китайской игровой индустрии.
Positive,"I'm still far from the last chapter and I don't normally write reviews, but when I do, it just means that the game is that amazing.Can't afford to skip any cutscene as it is just visually pleasing. The environment is beautiful up to every last detail. I love the idea that there is a boss after another which satisfies my souls-like needs. 10/10, game of the year for me. I can guarantee I'll be enjoying everything in this game while I venture through until the last fight."
Positive,I love it!
Positive,Monkee together stronk
Positive,"I was really worried that this game wouldn't run very well on my 3070, but I'm very glad to say it runs extremely well. Running a 1440p, all high settings and RTX on medium constantly above 60fps.As for the gameplay, as reviewers have said this is more of an Action game than a Soulslike, but that doesn't mean it's incredibly easy. I find myself still having to lock-in when fighting bosses and concentrate, but the boss I struggled on the most took maybe 10 attempts, and most of them I beat under 3. The combat feels really fluid though and is very fun. The levels are quite linear, and have a few branching paths for optional loot and bosses. The game is definitely more of a boss rush, you won't be going very long before meeting your next boss. I personally like that, the bosses are so far very interestingly designed and fun to fight."
Positive,"Monke want peace on mountain, but court say no. Remember Ruby Ridge."
Positive,This game is about monke. 10/10 🙉
Positive,FOR THE GOTY...
Positive,"God damn this game is good, been playing since it dropped and I'm only hopping off now so I can sleep lolLooks visually stunning, plays like a dream.Also reviews said the game isn't inclusive enough, but I'm on chapter 3 now and have beaten up Non-White and Non-AbleCPU: 7600xGPU: 4070"
Positive,"This game puts western AAA developers to shame. They spent significantly less money and still ended up with a result that is second to none. Every facet of the game just oozes quality, not just the visuals and the audio, but also when it comes to game design.This is a game by Chinese people for Chinese people. The story is still coherent even if you're not familiar with the source material, but you will also miss out on a lot of references, call outs, and character recognition. At least watching the 80's TV adaptation of Journey to the West highly recommended.It's also a game by gamers for gamers, so even if you're not here for the story you'll still find a very solid combat system, skill trees and itemization that enable somewhat different play styles, and lots of boss fights ranging from okay to peak gaming ecstasy. It's hard to pin down exactly what to classify this game as, since it takes inspiration from a diverse range of third-person action games. There's a heaping of Souls in there, but the combat owes much more to faster action games and you shouldn't expect nearly as much RPG progression.There are some not so great parts, like chapter 3 dragging on for way too long and the self-admittedly unfinished weird chapter 6 which lacks the direction of the previous ones. Some bosses lean more on the annoying side rather than being hard in an engaging way, basically making you have to stall in a game that is otherwise all about going balls to the wall. Some skills are outright broken and don't work as described and the thrusting stance has big issues hitting several bosses. None of this ruins the game, it's just fleeting annoyances in a sea of greatness.9.5/10, instantly went into NG+ and will for sure replay this in the future. Are we doing Black Myth: Water Margin next?"
Positive,"First and foremost, don't listen to the negative reviews. I'm a person who usually goes straight to read those first when I'm checking out a new game but everyone here seems to just be nitpicking. That or it's an issue because they don't have a proper PC to handle this gorgeous game. Now don't get me wrong, this game is far from being a perfect 10/10. But it's still amazing nonetheless. The visuals are astounding. The story telling could definitely use a bit of work but it's still enough to pull me in. You can't FULLY free roam. When you get close to somewhere that you shouldn't be, there is an invisible wall. The fighting is a mixture of souls-like games with hack and slash combos similar to games like Devil May Cry. The leveling up system is simple and easy to understand, I would write more but I'm in a rush to continue playing. So I hope everyone enjoys this gem as much as I am.My specs (because I haven't had any issues, mind you I'm running it at it's highest resolutions): Processors: Intel Core i9-13900KS 24-Cores 3.2GHz (6.0GHz TurboBoost)Motherboard: ASUS ROG MAXIMUS Z790 HERO DDR5Memory: 64GB CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 (2x32GB) 5600MHzGraphics Card: NVIDIA 24GB GeForce RTX 4090Operating System Drive: 2TB Samsung 990 PROHard Drive: 4TB Samsung 870 QVO Series"

Positive,NGL BEST GAME EVER GREAT MOVEMENT ANIMATIONS GREAT STORY TELLING BEAUTIFUL GRAPHIC  无敌黑马楼~~~
Positive,"I picked this game up the day it released an was immediately immersed in the story. I was enthralled by the idea that it followed a classic literary piece from the 1600's journey to the west about the origins of Sun Wukong. Upon entering the game you are thrown into an epic intro fight that lets you explore the true power of Wukong, and be an interactive part of the story telling process. It was quite frankly amazing and set high expectations for actual game play.After playing through the intro battle, and watching some story you are entered into a tutorial area that is incredibly linear. There are massive invisible walls blocking paths that look as though you could clear go down them. The feeling of any type of open world exploration was immediately dashed. The first couple of mobs you fight while you get your bearings died in one or two light attacks making the combat difficulty feel completely underwhelming. Again, it's a tutorial area so I shrugged it off and pushed on through.After completing chapter one of the game, I can say I stand by my original thoughts. The combat system in itself feels really good. It's fun, fast paced, engaging, and quite frankly how you approach bosses can be really unique. The talent and power systems are interesting and expansive, leaving a lot of room for customization which also feels good. The story doesn't feel dry, or repetitive but instead builds on itself as you meat different yougai and story characters.My complaints remain the same. Massive invisible walls in front of areas that look like they're supposed to be roamed leave the game feeling incredibly linear, and a bit boring from an exploration standpoint. It feels almost like a platformer in the sense that you can really only go one direction.Some of the larger bosses and mini bosses have incredibly wonky hit boxes. You can hit them from places you think you shouldn't be able to, and completely miss them during what looks like direct combat. I found the best way around this is to just stay close to bosses, dodge, and connect with the hit box when you  can. My final complaint is that the game is far too easy. Maybe by design, or maybe coming off of finishing Elden Ring DLC into this game makes it feel easy. This is a personal opinion, and isn't meant to discredit the game. I didn't see anywhere in the settings or when starting the game place to adjust to difficulty so I can only assume it has one difficulty. Maybe as I progress through chapters the game will ramp up in difficulty. Overall 7.5/10 using my stupid rating systemCombat - 8/10Story - 8/10Exploration - 4/10Talent system - 8/10Fun - 7/10"
Positive,Seriously fun once you get past the performance issues
Positive,"Great game, I would give it 8-9 out of 10. The invisible walls are a bit annoying, but the action system is good enough."
Positive,"Monkey see Monkey Do , I love Wu Kong so should you"
Positive,"Great game, 'Black Myth Wukong' draws inspiration from a traditional Chinese myth. It's not just a recreation of 'Journey to the West', it's an extension with its own story line. The intricate plot and challenging bosses contribute to the game's depth. The game has impressive aesthetics and meticulously accurate depictions of ancient chinese architecture and sculptures. The soundtrack is both catchy and epic. Challenging and difficult, yet intriguing, the game play invites me to strategize and tackle bosses with clever tactics rather than relying solely on brute force. Highly recommended."
Positive,"In the age of continuous releases of modern garbage meant for the ever so absent ""modern audiences"", Black Myth: Wukong is not just a gem but a very much needed wake up call for all. Not only does the game respect its players, the sincerity to stay true to lore while adding its own spin and flare to expand upon a beloved mythological tale highlights the care and respect Game Science has for their work.The game takes place after the story of Journey to the West, where the legendary QiTianDaSheng (Wukong) returns to his home HuaGuoShan after refusing immortality from the Celestials. After a fight takes place between the two parties, Wukong is defeated and supposedly sealed back into the stone at the top of the mountain. The story then begins when a prominent young descendent takes up the mantle in hopes of collecting the legendary artifacts left behind by Wukong and to one day live up to his predecessor's legend.While comparable to the Souls genre, Black Myth: Wukong is NOT a Souls game. Progression in general is much easier and the power fantasy is definitely a focus. As such, players will feel much stronger as they level and upgrade without needing to worry about the lost of progress from dying.The combat is dynamic and powerful, especially with every swing of your staff synchronizing to the vibration of your controller. Enemy variety is immense, and while the file and ranks do fall easily, players will also need to strategize against larger groups of them to succeed. This is made easier with unlockable abilities that can be upgraded in different directions paired with stance upgrades which directly impact your fighting style and combos.Itemization is also extremely diverse in this game, with armour giving unique set bonuses and your healing gourd having special effects as well. Players will also see the use of a curios system where unique items can be equipped to give minor boosts to stats or combat bonuses. As players progress and collects more materials, better armour can be crafted along with the option to upgrade the weapon which all comes with unique visuals and effects.The main focus of this game is the bosses, and there are many ranging from story bosses to open world optional bosses. Due to the fantastic combat system, every boss fight feels like a cinematic highlight. The music is as gorgeous as the environment, and both fit the theme of the boss extremely well. Players will need to think on the fly and devise the best way to tackle the boss, with some needing rapid attacks to pressure out of ranged retaliations and others needing players to be always on the move. And true to Wukong's lore, some defeated bosses can drop their spirits which players can absorb. Said spirits can be used to transform mid combat, allowing players to utilize certain attacks once belonging to the bosses players defeated earlier. This is diversity done right. Utilizing the power of Unreal Engine 5, Black Myth: Wukong is possibly one of the best looking games on the market today. The environment is diverse and expansive, with lush forests echoing the sound of crickets, streams, and rustling leaves, to barren wastelands and its blazing sun, players are presented the very best of what modern technology has to offer.Black Myth: Wukong is the epitome of passion and creative abundance. As of current, it has surpassed major titles like Elden Ring and Cyberpunk in all time player count at 2.2 millions while peaking at 1.4 million the night of launching. Not only does it excel in narrative and lore, it is visually stunning and audibly magnificent. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, especially those who attempt to pick apart this gem through desperate political theatrics and DEI drama. Remember: if you think you hate game journalists enough, you don't.Final score: 10/10 Strongly recommend for all"

Positive,"If you are going to read anything in my review, be this: If you want to understand what's happening, you should read/watch Journey to West. This game starts where that story ends and without knowing what happened before the prologue (or knowing a bit of Buddhist world-building), you won't be able to understand much of what is happening lore-wise. Yes, you can go Full Monke and bash everyone on your screen with your staff, but you'd lose what appears to be a very good story, at the very least until Act 2 (where I am rn).The game is awesome and, quite frankly, a breath of fresh air in a moment when good games are very, very few.Compared to a From Software game, since he is a ""souls-like"", BMW is very linear. Side paths will have important rewards that you should go and fetch, but to progress the story you have to basically keep moving forward. A ""grace"" system, similar to Elden Ring, guides you towards the next ""bonfire"" once you are reasonably close. The experience is much more forgiving than a Souls: no currencies lost on death, respawn points quite close to each other and the bosses gives you more than enough moments to heal up mid-fight once you have learnt their patterns.Performance-wise, the game is magnificent. I'm running it in cinematic mode and the FPS never went below 120, even during some very impressive ambient effects or bossfights. Walking around the various zones, each one is stunningly beautiful and the enemies I found up to now (I'm starting Act 2) are very well done."
Positive,"Amazing art piece, fun to play."
Positive,"As soon as monkey king went to heaven, My GPU and CPU went along with him.Monke <3"

Positive,After completing this game and getting true ending. This is my conclusion-Wukong is the game of the year? Nah .... Game of year will fail and deserve this game to make it shine this year!! What a master piece!!
Positive,It feels and plays like a charm. This might just become one of my all-time favorites. I’ll keep you posted.
Positive,Very good graphicsCombat is decent (will update if smth changes)Performance: -have stable 60+fps on ultra without Ray Tracing-have stable 60-75 fps with all ultra settings + Ray Tracing + DLSS Frame Generation
Positive,"What an amazing experience so far. The gameplay is pure fun, super responsive and satisfying. Perfect release aswell - no crashes, no bugs, nothing. Incredible. Game Devs really need to take notes. Creativity is off the charts with this one and oozes uniqueness out of every single pore. That said, Recommend if you like: - Dark Souls / FromSoftware Games- Smaller scale gameworld, heavy focus on fighting bosses- Customization / Gear progression- Different build possibilies to change your playstyle - (vague) story tellingplayed on RTX3060 12GB, AMD 7800x3D, 32GB Ram. 60-80 FPS, Medium Settings, 1440pEDIT after 50h playtime:Everything said above still stands. What genuinely impresses me is the stability and performance of the game. I expected it to fall off towards the later parts of the game, but it doesnt. Which sounds like it should be normal, but it really isn't in this day and age. So i appreciate that. Black Myth Wukong definitely is a Boss Rush kinda game. Yes, you can make comparisons to Soulslikes or God of War, but in the end of the day its vastly different from those. The scale is smaller, the gameplay more focused and compact. The only complaint I can make is that there isn't enough of it. All of what is in the game is incredibly well done and feels generally great to play. You'd only be wanting more. More stances, more attack variations.. etc.But what is there fits the game, its scale, its bosses and its general length. I hope we will see another title that takes this great base, expands on it and delivers a larger scale game that justifies even deeper mechanics.The small, yet meaningful variations to combat that are available for the player to skill into fit the content perfectly.Depending on difficulties you encounter there are systems in place for you to utilize against.For example: Struggling with ground effect mechanics and dodging? Use the pillar stance to your advantage to evade those.Additionally the gameplay is fairly smooth. It takes some getting used to - the light combo finisher and the heavy attack lock you in their animations, moves need to be executed ""carefully"" and wild button smashing is punished fairly often. This is a critique point for many - but for me it is just how Wukong plays. Its almost like a dance at times - a considered choreography of smashes executed by the player. It helps that it feels utterly satisfying to ""bonk around"" with your Monke (: As for the numerous bosses in the game - different to Elden Ring (which this game gets compared to alot, i don't know why tbh) the bosses in Wukong are unique. There are no copy pasta repetitive bosses. Now, some share certain mechanics like your average ground effect casting phase, but the fights generally play different from each other. What needs to be highlighted are the great designs of the bosses. I think they've done an incredible job and their art director needs to get all the praise possible. Additionally non of the bosses felt cheap or unfair. If i died, I always knew how to approach the fight next time. This is one of the core reasons as to why its not a drag to fight 80+ bosses or so in the game. This is especially refreshing, as some of the ""fan favourites"" of comparable games have in recent years tend to evolve in a direction that is less welcoming to the average player, but more so to those that want to be challenged by bosses. Unfortunately i don't see input reading or charge attacks as super fun. Black Myth Wukong is a welcomed change and a breath of fresh air. Another thing i'd like to highlight is how user-friendly the game is. Unhappy with your skill choices? Reset them at any shrine you want, for no cost whatsoever. Reset how often you want infact, try out what feels best for you and how you want to utilize the skills available to you! Weren't happy with the passive choices that can be leveled later on in the game? You'd rather have better stamina recovery for the current bossfight instead of additional mana? Sure, go back to the NPC, reset them and pick something else! Oh no, already beat the chapter boss before exploring an area you intentionally skipped for now? Or you want to complete your journal and you still have a boss open that you need to find? Don't worry about it, all areas are accessable even after chapter completion and you can even retroactively complete sidequests and what not! The game is here for you to enjoy and not get frustrated or having to know every detail beforehand. <3 Are you worried about dying and loosing your precious gathered currency (""Will"" similar to runes/souls)? Do not fray, friend! All will collected through defeating enemies or absorbing spirits stay with your character upon death.These are some of the great examples as to why Black Myth Wukong feels so rewarding and fun to play.Do you need to know the story/mythology the game is based on?No. It probably helps understanding certain dynamics, but the video sequences and dialogues with other characters do a great job of guiding you through the world. Apart from that your overall objective is quite simple. The creatures encountered throughout the chapters make for an incredibly fun and diverse experience. Humorous dialoge is also no stranger to Black Myth Wukong. They've done an outstanding job bringing these characters to life and having the game on chinese adds to the unique vibe. It is vague, there are questions but not everything needs to be laid out right infront of the player and some additional information can be aquired by reading the journal entries (which btw are well done). And since people love comparing them: Yes, the story is better than Elden Ring. ER's is even more vague, with basically nothing except for maybe an occasional npc dialoge and mostly relying on Lore entries and the player connecting the dots. This game does a better job of telling a story. There are more comments to be made about the game. Like the gear system that not only offers great looking armor pieces,, but also variations to gameplay, boosting certain abilites. Or how each Chapter has an incredibly well done short video of 3-5minutes to recap the story or tell a part of the mythology. Especially these videos are sooo well done and a pleasure to watch!Black Myth Wukong definitely is a passion project by the developers and you can tell. I can only advise anyone interested in these sort of games to open yourself up to the chinese mythology and enjoy diving into it. No wonder the game is so insanely popular in China. If a development studio would pour their heart and soul into an AAA title based on germanic folklore i'd similarly be all over that."
Positive,awesome game for a change
Positive,Game of the year
Positive,IGN complained about a lack of diversity but youre literally playing as a monkey???? hello?
Positive,"I've played 10 mins and can already tell this will be a GOTY winner - brilliant graphics, gameplay and a monke with attitudes - you will go bananas for this game - apes together stronk"
Positive,macaco porrete 👍
Positive,"This is supposed to be the game of the year, hopefully, it lives up to its expectations!"
Positive,"great bosses and good animations with poor exploration experience.put their heart into the art style and music, get it if u r interested and not bad at action gamesps: exploration gets better in the second level, not bad but still too many invisible walls"
Positive,"Playing on an MSI 32 GB Ram RTX 4070 Core(TM) i9-13900HOverall the performance on my laptop is amazing! I heard AMD has issues but nothing that cant be remedied. The gameplay is fresh and not as challenging as Souls games. The narrative is great and the story manages to keep you intrigued. the lintier open world aspect is fresh and satisfying with this game It is a very big fresh breathe of air to see a game succeed, that denied DEI extortion. A game with its own diverse culture does not need western ideologies. These are video games that tell a story about something unique and This one is a video game made with care and creativity!overall 10/10"
Positive,"""By order of Xi Xi Ping, 2 billion Chinese must play!""Review after 40 Hours (Chapter 4 of 6)This is 100%, a Chinese take on God of War using the mythos of Journey to the West. The game expects that you have some knowledge of the original story as you will be retracing the steps of Sun Wukong to reclaim his lost power and challenge the Gods once more. If you are not familiar with Journey to the West, the story won't make a lot of sense and the game does not dole out enough lore through conversations or other methods to make up the difference.That being said, if you're the type of person to just play something like Elden Ring with zero regard for the story and world building, than you won't have an issue here. Black Myth Wukong is an extremely competent first attempt by Game Science and all though I have some caveats regarding it's game design and overall performance, they're minor enough for me to not really complain about them.One issue I will point out is that sometimes input reading is delayed or missed entirely, so you could finish a combo and say, press the button to chug from your flask and it will just not register whatsoever. That and some of the skill descriptions are clearly machine translated and not very clear, so you'll have to figure out some things on your own.By the way, the game isn't hard at all if you breezed through something like Shadows of the Erdtree, but some of the boss fights can be challenging if you don't know what you're doing. Also, experiment, experiment, experiment. The game is super generous with allowing you to do so.Do get Black Myth Wukong if:- You enjoy God of War style action games- You enjoy build crafting (the game is very generous with respecs)- Enjoy some ""souls-like"" features with the punishing stuff removed- Lots of boss fightsDon't get Black Myth Wukong if:- You haven't upgraded your PC in the last 4 years- You dislike God of War style action games- You hate anything ""souls-like""- You are worried about your expenditure going to the CCP"

Positive,"GOTY       9.5/10The fights and scenes are smooth and beautiful. The COMBAT is SO ADDICTIVE. Absolutely epic. The game runs quite stably.(3070+2.5K resolution+TSR+super resolution 60). The standard difficulty is easy for ACT/ARPG players, a bit hard for others. (enemies deal fairly damage, dodge windows are almost forgiving) BUT THE INVISIBLE WALLS ARE USELESS AND DISAPPOINTING, so it cant get a 10/10, but a 9.5/10 is still the GOTY of 2024."
Positive,"A fantastic game. Although the game has crashed for 7 times during the opening CG, I still want to give full marks to it. In order to fix the bug like me, you should use compatible mode to enter the game, update the NVIDIA driver and lower the graph quality. Once you finish the opening CG, you can set your graph quality higher and there will not be bugs. The art designing is out of this world. Many traditional Chinese cultural signs are displayed in the game, making it a imagined Chinese Utopia. Despite the scenery, the combat is so exciting that I can't help playing it from 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and end up because of eye strain unwillingly. I love the game and I love Game Science."

You feel the love and the attention to detail from the people who worked on this project. While I don't think it's quite at the level of a Game of the Year contender, it has lived up to the hype which is no easy task. I look forward to any future project coming out of this studio."

Positive,"It has been a great surprise, I didn't believe that a new chinese studio could deliver a game like this. Definitely game of the year material, a good take on the Journey to the West novel.I want address the 2 main flaws of this game:There's no combo system, I mean the combat feels good but you don't unlock special moves that let you mix light and heavy attacks to unleash powerful combos, plus some bosses can parry your heavy attack, so basically it's very effective to spam the light attack button with the occasional dodge.The other issue for me is that the game feels better in the more linear chapters, cause you have no map and tons of invisible walls but there are some many missable well hidden secrets, even entire areas and bosses. And exploration without the proper tools doesn't feel good, it breaks the pace from one boss fight to another, and this problem is particularly noticeable in chapter 3.Combat feels great, spell and transformation are cool, bosses are awesome and impressive enemy variety. Compelling story, interesting characters, extremely good music and cinematics. Crafting and upgrades are meaningful and you can respec easily without limits so you can try out every build you can think of without regrets.A well crafted title in so many aspects that deserve the praise and possibly the award for GOTY 2024."
Positive,"Played the first few hours. Very very satisfied. Plays like a cross between God of War and Dark Souls, except it's a LOT less punishing and frustrating than Dark Souls. Not to say it's an easy game, but the difficulty is just right. If you've every played  SoulsBorne game, you know how frustrating and unfair those games can feel. It's filled with an awesome and diverse array of enemies and bosses and the combat is very satisfying so far as well. If you know about Chinese culture and the classic ""Journey to the West,"" it makes this game all that more enjoyable. Awesome game."

Positive,"This game isn’t exactly easy, and you don’t get to pick the difficulty, but the awesome visuals and battles totally make up for it! The first 5 hours have some annoying invisible walls, but you’ll start to figure out where they are, so no big deal. Finding save points can be a bit tricky, but aside from that, I’m really enjoying it!8.5/10 (as for now)"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a very great AAA game. Everything in the game is perfect. This is the first Wukong-related game I've ever played, and it didn't disappoint me at all. Before the game was released, I have high expectations from developers. And this game fulfilled everything I had hoped for. This is a TRUE AAA game that I couldn't stop playing~!I can't wait to see more Wukong-related games, or Romance of the Three Kingdoms, or games from the Jinyon universe, especially ""The Return of the Condor Heroes"", This is my favorite movie that I would most like to see as a game~!9/10 ♥The subtitles are very small, I hope the developers will add options the can adjust the subtitles size very soon, especially adding the names of the characters who are speaking is something I really want to see in this game~!

Positive,"So far the game is doing everything I hoped it would; love the presentation of the world, the enemy design, the voice acting, the use of at least some of the 72 transformations. It's all exactly what i wanted from a Sun Wukong game so far. I play the game with Chinese audio and English subtitles, and if I had one complaint it would be the that the minor mobs' barks and dialogue have no subtitles. Not a deal breaker by any means, but it would be great to understand the conversations i'm overhearing in Golden Cicada form."
Positive,After about 5 hours of gameplay. Here is my review on this amazing game.

Positive,"Black Myth Wukong ReviewI played 10 hours but so I think it will say I played 10 hours, I didn't beat the game, yet I still made this comprehensive review to explain the core aspects of the game and it's quality. This review uses my own experience and those of my friends who got ahead in the game. I am 23 years old, and I don't enjoy souls likes anymore in the long term. Still, I did my review objectively and I think you might find it useful. Cheers!~Black Myth Wukong is a soul-like game that adds some interesting elements to the genre by incorporating new ideas into its gameplay through the legendary tale of Sun Wukong. Players can transform into bosses they defeated before (with some limitations), and Wukong's tricks are plenty. They can range from transforming into rock to making multiple clones of themselves or freezing foes in place, unable to move or fight back.The player will explore the tale of the legendary monkey king while fighting challenging bosses and recovering the artifacts of Wukong. The game starts easy but rapidly reaches difficulty levels of your most popular soul games, requiring skill, strategy, and wits to defeat fearsome foes.What Makes It Worth Playing?If there is something people hear about this game, it is two things: transforming into bosses and ray tracing. The ray tracing of the game looks beautiful, as reflections and environments look superb on the screen. The requirements are quite bulky, as I used an RTX 4070 Super and could either go 2k with Ray Tracing at medium with settings on very high for 70-90 FPS or 4k with no ray tracing at the same frame rate.The story is surprisingly very good and interesting, voice actors do well in their assigned roles, and the opening of the game is similar to a blockbuster movie. The tale deals with wanting to be free, which Wukong wants, but the Celestial Court won't let him be. In addition, the court enjoys mocking him and other beast-like creatures, angering him as he rebels to prove his might. The difficulty is another aspect that might attract players looking to establish themselves and face off against challenging foes in exciting and nerve-wracking gameplay.Core GameplayThe game's core combat focuses on options and the availability of resources. The player has multiple avenues for choosing how to fight enemies, such as spirits that they can summon and take their form to unleash special attacks, becoming bosses, using skills such as invisibility, or using their pole to get above the enemy and avoid attacks. Having so many assets to use on foes and see what works best against certain enemies is incredibly fun and rewarding.The premise is that the game is a boss rush; you go to a place, explore it, beat the boss, and move on. If you defeat bosses effortlessly, you run into a lot of bosses on the norm, and each combat is intriguing and unique. Battle monks that summon the fallen, rat siblings in a 1vs2, giant tigers that bathe in the blood of their foes with big swords, etc. The game action is fast, so you have to act quickly before enemies resume the onslaught of attacks. There is no co-op for this game (so those that like souls games with co-op experiences, be warned, it is only going to be you!), and there is no punishment for dying in-game, so you are stress-free and don't have to pick up your ""souls"" or currencies of other types.My ExperienceI enjoyed my time in the game, as brief as it was (I am getting old to be playing this hardcore game, I swear, haha~). I didn't find the stances attractive, as the default stance worked better for me than the other two. The tricks of Wukong are fun to use, and in boss fights, you need to use all of your arsenals intelligently to emerge victorious on the challenging boss fights, which is a great gameplay design. Enemies often have their particular bag of tricks they will use on the player.I used many points in the foundation, mainly HP and stamina. I also used some points in transformations and the immobility spell, as they are instrumental. The gameplay is like a combination of souls, like in action games. It is hard, but you are as powerful as your foes, making the soul-like experience less stressful and difficult. The game's presentation is fantastic; enemies react to your boss's transformations, and the dialogue in fights is on par with the rest of the game.Long Term AppealA game playthrough will last between 40-60 hours, depending on your skill, and you can always replay the game after beating it to challenge even stronger foes. I am getting burned out of the genre. Go there, fight a powerful enemy, get destroyed, do it again until you succeed, and repeat for another 40 hours. I may have been playing too much Elden Ring, but I don't enjoy Souls games as much as I did before.Back to the review, if you like challenges meant to block your progression and prove your skills, this game is impressive. It excels at all its facets and is incredible to experience. If you prefer to avoid difficulty, be wary. It is a marathon to get to the end of this title, as the mountain is rather tall and complex to climb.Price Point AnalysisIt is an easy buy for its asking price. If your computer can run it, you are guaranteed to have a good time with this game.ConclusionIn a genre so cluttered with so many games that it feels oversaturated, Black Myth Wukong succeeds in adding a new spice to the genre by revolutionizing the gameplay and rewards of its core experience. It is a must-play for all souls, like fans who enjoy this title, and an invitation to try it out for those who feel braver and confident in their skills. This game's graphics, music, story, gameplay, and design are superb and worth all the praise it's been getting.10/10 MASTERPIECE"
Positive,Game of the year 2024
Positive,"Amazing game!! I waited so long for this and am not disappointed! This game is beautifully done. Environment looks great, sound is nice, and the game is semi open but keeps you on course to advance through the story. The smaller minions are pretty easy to kill or get around for the most part, which I don't mind at all.  Some bosses are very tough but not quite as bad as dark souls, and I did find myself having to try 15+ times on a few of them so far.   If you like God of War and/or Dark Souls games you will probably be a fan of this.  I was a little worried on how well my computer would handle this but I've not had a single issue running at all highest settings on a 4k monitor.  I am using an I9 14900kf 14th gen and a 4070TI with 64gb of ram and this game was optimized very well!"
Positive,BEST GAME 2024!!!! MAN! How I love this game!
Positive,"so fun to play, just amazing"
Positive,"Embrace monke, be monke, fight as monke, overall monke"
Positive,"One of the most epic opening scenes to a video game that I have experienced and I must say I am really hooked. The visuals and particle effects are absolutely stunning. Combat also feels really smooth and responsive. Like God of War, world exploration is linear but there's nooks and crannies for easter eggs and additional lore. Can't wait to keep playing and bash things with my giant pole!"
Positive,"Overall, it's worth GOTY. Hard to imagine a group of 100 ppl achieved this quality. The invisible wall disrupted some immersion, which I hated at the beginning. But once you get past that, the game is incredible, offering the best graphics and content you could ever imagine for Journey to the West"

Positive,"im playing for two hours, and i didn't get bored for a secondim voting this game for GAME OF THE YEAR"
Positive,"Art, Combat, Story, Optimization. You name it, you can have them all! GOTY Let's goo."
Positive,Aside from some Screen tearing and FPS drops and some pop in and graphical issues here and there I'm enjoying my time.
Positive,"At first I was upset as the opening cutscene i got sub 30 fps, then beat the opening fight, got a random crash and had to redo the opening fight again, no skipping cutscenes allowed. Although this was probably a shader issue, i should have just restarted the game. After the crash I've had a smooth 120 fps+ experience the last 4 hours, so far so good. The music is great, really draws you in to the boss fight. So far i'm loving the game, if something changes my opinion down the road then i'll change this. As of now, this is just a good game, plain and simple."
Positive,Beautiful game ! I can't wait to play more and enjoy the story.
Positive,"Five stars, amazing game. Looks incredible and is difficult in a fun way."
Positive,"10/10 Game of the YearEasily Game of the Year. my personal pick at least. It is NOT a souls-like, if anything it's more like a hack-n-slash with RPG elements. the world is semi-open, semi-linear. by that, I meanyou are being led by the environment, funneled into spaces but can go off the main path. I even used a hidden path to completely avoid a difficult boss and progress, all without breaking a sweat.If your in a situation that is giving you grief, you might be able to avoid it by going around. Explore and look around before facing an enemy head on. the game rewards exploration. I found items in chests that helped me defeat the Fire Yaoguai (IDK his name) because I went a little off the beaten path. the graphics are amazing. it is simply a gorgeous next-gen level game. the details on the characters make each look unique. The items, which are beautifully crafted, stand out from the equally-beautiful environment. The combat move set flows nicely together for smooth combos. every button, you feel the weight of the weapon swing. It tells a unique, rich story based off the Chinese novel: ""Journey to the West"". While you don't need to read the book to understand the game, it will help contextualize the story setting. This game should be the industry standard for triple A games. Simply, a must have for your game library. Worth every penny spent."
Positive,"I've only played for two hours so far, so these are my initial thoughts. I will provide further updates as I progress.Pros:1. The animation quality is excellent.2. The game features a superb soundtrack.3. The combat delivers a satisfying sense of impact.4. The visuals are meticulously detailed.Cons:1. There is some noticeable screen tearing around the character when the camera pans left or right.2. The facial expressions of the characters appear rather stiff.3. The game lacks sufficient guidance for new players.4. There's no map available. While this could be considered part of the game’s guidance issues, it’s a significant drawback for me personally, so I've listed it separately."

Positive,To my own surprise it's actually pretty good.
Positive,"Absolutely a Great Gamewhat to expect:- a Demonsouls/Darksouls 1 base- a simple gather and crafting system- a great narrative- stunning visuals- many unique and fun battle features- the gourd (flask) it contens can be brewed with key-items for additional boni- ""git gud"" this is not a souls-like game, combat is vastly differentIssues you might encounter:- some ""growing"" trees during the final intro cutscene- offset lipsync (if you are using english voice)i will write more about this game at a later time, for now i will keep it short and simple"

Positive,"This game piqued my interest ever since the first trailer where he pulls the staff out of his ear and spins it around. There are not a lot of games around where you can use a staff, spin it around like a maniac and enjoy it. So far, I only managed to play just a little bit before work but if the whole game is like this, this is a definite win. The dodging mechanic is a bit clunky imo, but hey, it might me just me and my rusted gamer instincts. There were a few reviews that compared this game to God of War in terms of fighting mechanics, and while I agree to some point, it is a lot faster. The movements are a bit more less impact-full, let's say. In no meaning this is a bad thing but just so you know. I highly recommend this game and the actual book.Embrace the monke"
Positive,Reject humanity return to MONKE
Positive,"Honestly wish I could leave a mixed review cuz like yeah it's pretty fun but like most of the bosses are dogshit, idk couldn't really get into it"
Positive,"Graphics are stunning, the intro was hype and the combat feels fun, fluid and challenging and it appears there's a good amount of progression. Leaves a very strong first impression if you enjoy soulslikes."
Positive,lore accurate MONKE
Positive,"Good looking game and fun combat. There are combat elements from all sorts of game like Dodge offsets from Bayo, Stances from Nioh just to name a few."

Positive,"games makes you feel like an overpowered anime character. combat takes a little getting used to, but feels very good once you figure out the mechanics and timing. bosses are diverse and challenging, and dont feel unfair or bugged. the fights in between bosses are fairly easy but encounters are varied enough to stay interesting. on an rtx 3080 and ryzen 9 5900xthe only major issue so far is stutteringfps stays consistent locked to 60 on high/very high graphics, 3440x1440, ray tracing off, DLSS 70%, without being locked it varied from 65-80"
Positive,"Received the game as part of a bundle with the R.O.G SCAR 18 2024 4080 VersionI am playing it on my desktop with an R.T.X 4090, 13900 K, 32 GB Corsair dominator memorysettings on Full scale resolution at 100% and Ray Tracing on Full and Cinematic setting, FPS fluctuating between 102 and 110 including the opening battle with all those effects going on.I played 30 minutes so far, Unreal Engine 5 really shines here, absolutely stunning graphics, I feel like I am walkingwith the monkey in the forest, all i need is a forest scented candle ( getting it tomorrow).I think the character movement while walking and running seems a little off ( clunky i think, but not really )nothing that cant be fixed with an update or a future MOD. The fighting is amazing another reviewer compared it to a Chinese God of War and that's a good thing, and Amazing thing.i'm looking forward to Game Science succeeding big time and bringing us amazing games in the future.for now I give this Game a Strong buy, I know it's only 30 minutes and I will update this review when i am at 50 hours even if I am not done but I have a hunch from what I just experienced that the Strong buy will change to a must buy.Let me know what you guys out there think."
Positive,"Edit: Update, NVIDIA Just Released driver 560.94 and it fixed bad stutters i can push the game to low RT with high and medium settings 70+ fps smooth. Highly Recommend you update before you leave a review. Amazing Game Original review:Game is not smooth and it doesn't look good without ray tracing enabled (But tanks the performance to unplayable when even set to low) i shouldn't have to lower the settings like i'm on GTX 1060...3080ti with 12900K @1440P with 1 hour of settings tested and it is not playable. Locking it to 60 is not an option on an ultra wide. Frames stutter like crazy in the forest.Love the game but the performance & Graphics are bad."
Positive,This game is cinema
Positive,Ignore all the people saying it runs like shit because it doesn't. I have 6600xt graphics card and the game runs perfect at 70-80 fps with no drops on medium to high settings. The game is beautiful.
Positive,Great fucking game but toooo harddddddd
Positive,It lacks inclusivity and diversity...Thanks to Screenrant for the review!!!!!REJECT HUMANITY BECOME MONKE!Edit: Harambe did nothing wrong.

Positive,THIS GAME IS AMAZING EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. SOME GOOD SHIT RIGHT HERE. THIS IS HOW GAMES SHOULD BE NO NONSENSE. SWEET BABY INC FAILED NOTHING BUT W'S. HIGHLY RECOMMEND WUKONG IS A STRAIGHT G. DIALOG AND CUT SCENES ARE SICK. WELL WORTH THE MONEY NOT GONNA GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL CAUSE DON'T WANNA SPOIL ANYTHING. BUY THE GAME. BASED DEV'S GREAT GAME-PLAY TONS OF CUSTOMISATION THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. 10/10 ALL DAY GAME SCIENCE CAME WITH THE HEAT DOPE ASS GAME.
Positive,"+ Music+ Nice art + Interesting gameplay and skills+ Interesting background= Path-finding moderate difficulty- Keyboard bindings suck- High difficulty- for people without the background story knowledge - it's a very confusing openingOverall, I would say try it.-----update---- (Major negative point) Unsatisfying storyline and OOC content! Wukong freaking just really died. What the fk?!Excuse me, but if this is all the endings, what the hell?!--- OK, if I don't consider this a derived story of Journey to the West, then it's still recommended."
Positive,Maybe I judged China too harshly
Positive,It's good..  getting my ass kicked but its fun and really beautiful.
Positive,"Don't mind the crosschatter. The game plays well on a 2080 super. The bosses are fun, combat is fluid, lots of interesting things to see and ways to level up. It's not probably what you are thinking it is, Check it out streaming and see what you think. I've played a lot worse for more money. I am really impressed with the visuals and the voice acting is great. It's immersive, fun and you could drop a lot of time in this. I didn't get this for free, I am not paid for this review. It's just a fun game that has run the gamut of Social Media and I wanted to put my two cents in here for anyone who may be on the fence. It's more of a ARPG than a soulsike to me and that's fine."
Positive,"This game is sooooooo wonderful and amazing. You can never imagine this is the first product of Game Science.Of course this game is not perfect. The map is not easy to recognize. And the action modules of bosses are not that great, comparing to Capcom's Monster Hunter.While, this game DO have a lot of shining areas. The most impressive part is the art and design, for both environment and characters. The mountain is so beautiful and the enemies' design is so diverse. You can feel that each enemy has its own story and character. It feels like a real world.I highly recommend you to try this game. Although it's not perfect."
Positive,AWESOME!!! That intro fight was amazing! And if you're a dork for Wu Kong you'll immediately appreciate the intro set-up. It's less souls-like and more Action Slasher than I thought it would be. There's skills you can level up and upgrade as you gain levels killing things.Stunning Graphics and sound design.Absolute joy.Can't wait to play more of it!
Positive,Getting 110fps on 2070 super. 75% Super Resolution and crashed maybe once in my gametime. Game runs pretty well.
Positive,"Monkee, my dear!Can you release soundtrack? plz"
Positive,I am having fun in this game. Been a huge fan of Wukong!
Positive,I want a fucking truck to run over Wandering Wight :)
Positive,"All I can say is, it's Amazing!"
Positive,monkey with stick 10/10
Positive,"Admittedly I am not far in, but this game is just gorgeous.  It's a bit more linear than I expected, but there is a lot to do and find inside the areas.  The movement is fluid, the environmental rendering is stunning. The mandarin voice acting is impeccable, I was a bit thrown off by the English voices but not everyone like to deal with subtitles so that's just a personal preference.  Really looking forward to see how this story plays out."
Positive,"Wow. Just wow. What a gem this game is! Well done devs! Hard work pays off. All thos gen Z journalists who took a dump on the game can go f*** themselves. This game is amazing. Runs smooth, gameplay is awesome, fighting is awesome."
Positive,GOTY 10/10 Cant wait for dlc. I love extending my pole.

Positive,"Played it on a differnt account.Black Myth: Wukong is a breathtaking masterpiece that seamlessly weaves Chinese mythology into a visually stunning action RPG. Developed by Game Science, this game takes players on an epic journey through the rich world of Journey to the West, offering a fresh and engaging narrative that both honors and reinterprets the classic tale.Visuals and Art Direction: One of the standout features of Black Myth: Wukong is its stunning graphics. The environments are lush and detailed, bringing to life the vibrant landscapes of ancient China. Character designs are equally impressive, with the Monkey King, Wukong, rendered in a way that captures both his mischievous spirit and formidable power. The animation is fluid, making combat sequences exhilarating and visually striking.Gameplay Mechanics: The gameplay is a masterclass in combat design, blending fast-paced action with strategic elements. Players can utilize Wukong’s shapeshifting abilities to adapt to different combat scenarios, providing a dynamic experience. The variety of enemies and intricate boss battles keep the gameplay fresh and challenging, ensuring players are always on their toes.Narrative and Characters: The storytelling is rich and immersive, exploring themes of loyalty, courage, and identity. Wukong's journey is not just about defeating foes; it's about understanding his place in the world and the responsibilities that come with power. The supporting characters are well-developed, adding depth to the narrative and enhancing the overall experience."

Positive,monkey game good.
Positive,"Monke is love, Monke is life"
Positive,"It's a pretty good game, fantastic graphics and the scenery is really beautiful. Even the dessert areas are pretty amazing. I can almost never defeat a boss first try, but when I do defeat them after like 2 hours it feels like I actually accomplished something. Typically they also give you access to new armour or weapons, or there's a pill nearby and it will increase you maximum health/stamina/mana. If you just want a casual game to play where you don't really have to do much then I wouldn't recommend this to be honest. But, if you want a challenging fighting game then I think this would be a nice fit for you."
Positive,"Spectacular. Rich storytelling, and satisfying combat depth (with easy to grasp basics), and breathtaking views. With each Chapter feels more and more that if Sekiro and DMC5 had a baby, it’d be Black Myth: Wukong (can’t believe I’m making this comparison either).It’s not your classic Soulslike to be confidently labelled as such (I’d say BM:W belongs to Soulslike as much as Sekiro belongs to Soulsborne, i.e. a stray that somehow managed to get adopted into a fam but still looks weird next to its newfound siblings). Just do mind that there are definitely enough challenges to overcome in the face of major bosses. As a side note, additional kudos to Game Science for making that many boss encounters unique and memorable.As for level design, following BM:W's no-nonsense, linear levels feels much better than scrambling through some half-empty open world with recycled content, so I’d take quality over quantity in terms of map size any day. Yes, invisible walls are pain, but honestly? Game’s so good in other aspects that I can kinda live with the invisible walls, no biggie."
Positive,"I am not into soulslikes, never played it, my reflexes are not what they used to be. Bought the game by interest, motivated to grind on because screw game journos and their lies.Been told by proper, real game testers that this game is easier to grasp, although i'll be eating dust a lot still.Not gonna lie, they were absolutely right.But this is fun. This is doable. There's no deep punishment to fail (although consumables you used don't come back, that's okay).I'll polish it till it's completed, 100%.Mhhhh. Monkey."
Positive,Reject the HeavensReturn to Monke
Positive,it is a wave of indescribable pleasure i felt playing this game
Positive,This game is absolutely fun! So far I'm having such a blast!
Positive,"Monkey see, Monkey do"
Positive,"Amazing game and overall one of the best representative of ""souls-like"" genre.It's big and beatiful with tons of secret quests, areas and bosses. Story is simple yet entertaining with many interesting characters.But what makes this game so great it's definitely a fast, challenging combat system with more than 80(!) unique bosses on your way. 10 out of 10 for me and HUGE claim for GOTY/"
Positive,"This is the game I've been waiting for. I love Dark Souls etc, but I just am too old and slow to fully get into them. I always get shit on about half way through or so to the point where I literally cannot proceed. This game I think is the PERFECT difficulty setting for people like me. It's still hard as all hell, but I'm able to get through it if I try my hardest. Some bosses I have to try my hardest many, many times lol and that's great. Besides all that, I can say this game is gorgeous and so incredibly polished. But possibly the most important part: There are ZERO microtransactions. ZERO battle pass. ZERO cash shops. You buy the game and you get the game. The items in the game are earned by completing challenges in the game. This is how gaming needs to be again, please, please more of this. I will forever pay full price for games that honor this system. I hate that I've been tricked by greedy corporations over and over again and this game is a rare beacon of light towards a promising future. 10/10 from me boys"
Positive,"Was this worth it for a seven year wait? Yes. Yes it was. In fact, it delivered even MORE than I expected. So stoked I am able to return to monke. In all seriousness though, as someone who really really loves God of War, the mechanics are very similar to it and as such, make the game even more enjoyable to me. However, I do feel this game does take it a step further from the steps that GOW laid out and for that, it makes me all the more grateful and have all the more fun with it. The most unexpected thing that really threw me is the fact that instead of playing as THE MONKEY KING himself. We're playing as his apprentice/predecessor, which I find very unique and actually really like."
Positive,"This game almost made me quit at chapter 2. The start felt like i had a color. Could not do anything with my powers and attacks. When i found the hidden areas, everything changed. This game is worth playing, its hard but fair. One boss had me stuck for 4 days but i got good son. Amazing story music and combat. Game feels more like God of War with the re-spawning of Dark Souls. 100% should get game of the year."
Positive,"I have a hard time to decide between this and final fantasy 7 for who is the game of the year. I remember that when this game was first teased a couple of years ago , many people were extremely suspicions , saying that this game is impossible to be made. Now that we have this game finally here, i can only say that i'm impressed with everything . The combat is amazing , the graphics are next gen, the main character is memorable and unique , the bosses are hard but fair and the design is top noch . 10/10 game ."

Positive,Great Game indeed. Love it.
Positive,"For me, it's an 8 out 10 decent games I wish I could give 10 but the game has few problems like there too many invisible walls, combat could be more dynamic only 1 weapon type 1 combo 3 stances attacks and the way story was told was really bad I didn't fully understand what's going on, everything else was made amazingly"
Positive,"This game is amazing. Plays really well, looks really nice. No BS politics in the game, the story was an Anime straight from the start, Im hooked. Its like a casual Elden Ring as far as boss fights go. Tricky, but still really fun and a lot easier IMO as someone who struggles with this Genre."

First off this game looks beautiful and it runs really well, but I dont have too much play time as of right now to tell you all if this game is top tier or its meh. I'll update you all later whenever I have more playtime into the game!"
Positive,"Its a beautiful game. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay loop is awsome, the fighting is perfect. There are a couple of things i think anyone who wants to buy it should know.1. Its not a true open world game, there is no map, you follow a specific path, and explore secret areas that stray not far from the path. 2. the lip sink on english mode is dogshit, as it is originaly chinese3. dont download the game on a hard drive, the audio will bug out during cut scenes if you do.Have fun!"

Positive,"A game with hype that releases and isn't an utter joke on PC? Not bad, China.... not bad."
Positive,Naming this a black myth because of monkey has to be racist 10/10
Positive,"absolutely stunning, running at around 70-85 FPS on RTX 4080 mobile @ 1440p, with RT set to Very High, graphics set to Cinematic and DLSS to 75 with Frame Gen on. Beautiful game, not souls like but the combat is still fun and anyone can adjust to it.update: it's not the easiest game but it's not as hard as most of the souls games."
Positive,"Great game. I'm not a fan of soul-like/lite games, but I enjoy playing this one and experience the landscape, art, mythology, and storytelling. I do have a word about the ""lack of diversity and inclusion"" controversy. This game is made by non-Westerners. It depicts Chinese culture and mythology, a culture underrepresented in the West. In a Western context, this game falls exactly at the heart of diversity. Meanwhile, intolerance of a game like this is the exact opposite of inclusion."
Positive,"It's a brilliant game, I really liked it, I won't go into detail about the nuances, it's a completely cool game, even though I don't know English very well, the subtitles didn't make me feel uncomfortable, but I'm very sad because I can't recommend it to any of my friends, because no one will play it, if they play it, they can't miss the first boss and will be deleted. Not everyone is a gamer, not idle, people go to work, not everyone is stupid like me to spend so much time on this game. Those over 30 who just want to play a very cool game, simply cannot play it. It was the first game in this genre that I played, I really didn't spend so much time on any game. That's why I'm so sad that it's not for everyone. Thanks to the authors and all the working staff. Finally, I finished with a good ending."
Positive,"Where did this come from? An incredible souls-like that has everything you could ask for. Combat is really satisfying and the story is fascinating. You know a game has grabbed you when you are researching the mythology around it and trying to learn moreThis game is based around ancient Chinese mythology and Buddhism, it continues on from one the most popular novels of all time ""Journey to the West"", and it seems to have done so with a lot of respect for it's source material, the entire story seems incredibly authentic and helps to create an insanely rich world that you can get pretty lost in. A must play for anyone that enjoys this genre. Insane that it is only the developer's 2nd ever game"
Positive,"Gameplay and Boss Fights:The gameplay is incredibly fun, with most bosses offering a thrilling experience. A few are particularly challenging, even harder than hardest bosses in Souls games. The mobs are also well-designed. It's satisfying to get behind them, only to be surprised by a powerful counterattack that prevents cheap hits.Cinematic Brilliance and Soundtrack:Visually, this game is on another level. The cinematics are stunning, deeply emotional, and beautifully crafted—especially the mini films, with the last one being most touching. The soundtrack complements these moments perfectly, adding to the emotional depth and making certain scenes hit even harder.Minor Flaws:The game does have a few minor issues that may or may not bother players, depending on personal preference. For example, some areas require a long walk without a checkpoint, which can be frustrating. Another small gripe is the restrictive pathing—there are many places that look like you could explore or jump into, but invisible walls prevent it. One final gameplay-related issue I had was with the movement. When running, if you dodge or jump, Wukong's momentum breaks instead of flowing smoothly, which felt like a missed opportunity for more fluid gameplay.Biggest Flaw:In my opinion, the game's biggest shortcoming is its lack of a recap or introduction that explains the backstory for players unfamiliar with Journey to the West. Games like Devil May Cry 5 handle this well, offering a brief explanation at the beginning so new players aren’t lost. Without a similar feature, those who haven't read Journey to the West might miss out on fully appreciating the incredible characters. I've read it about 4 years ago and I forgot some things, but someone who didn't really know much about Wukong is unfamiliar with Zhu Bajie, they wouldn't grasp how awesome he is on first encounter, as his backstory with Wukong is only briefly touched on through dialogue and it is rather confusing just reading an attempt at making players remember something they didn't know in the first place. You could easily tell the target was the Chinese audience, but would have still been so much more if these important characters were better explained."
Positive,"Nice combat move, cool combo, unique fighting style... Also stunning visual everytime you meditation"
Positive,"10/10 GOTY, 'nuff said. Beat the game in 70 hours and about to start NG+. Looking forward to beating the shit out of these bosses. Yellow Loong and Erlang, better watch your backs!"
Positive,"After completing both endings at around the 50-hour mark and now aiming for 100% achievements, I can confidently say that this game is a true masterpiece.The combat system is stellar, offering a dynamic and engaging experience. While I did encounter some minor issues, such as input lag during the fourth chapter where dodging seemed unresponsive in the face of enemy attacks, everything else about the combat is exceptional. The variety of builds is impressive, allowing players to freely experiment and respec skill points at any time. The progression system offers plenty of ways to enhance your character, from permanent celestial medicines that boost stats, to unique armor sets and upgradeable weapons that provide powerful bonuses.I appreciated the fair difficulty balance for each boss. The game strikes a perfect blend of challenge and forgiveness, where boss fights feel intense but never -too- punishing. You can jump into them stress-free, as death only costs a bit of sanity instead of hard-earned progress.This is not an open-world game, and at times it can feel restrictive with invisible walls blocking paths where you expect freedom. However, the game’s linear progression still provides plenty of exploration, especially as the world opens up the deeper you go. One of my favorite aspects of the game is how it introduces its mechanics gradually, never overwhelming players from the start.There’s a great sense of learning and mastery as you progress, and the quest structure provides plenty of variety without feeling convoluted.As someone with a budding interest in Asian mythology, I found the storytelling here captivating. The narrative is steeped in mythological themes, and while it can feel vague at times, each chapter brings clarity through lore-filled animations. The game is inspired by the classic novel Journey to the West, but diverges into its own darker, more atmospheric take on the source material. The characters and world draw you in, and after experiencing both endings, I’m left with a bittersweet feeling—both fulfilled and wanting more.While I loved much of the game, a few things did stand out as frustrating. Achievements that require multiple playthroughs, or lock you out of quests based on progression, can feel restrictive. The RNG-based achievements, like gathering all 15 seeds, can be particularly tedious. For example, the celestial pear tree only spawns 4 trees on the map with a 30-minute real-life respawn time, and there’s only a slim chance of getting the seeds you need. It feels like unnecessary padding for completionists.As someone new to the souls-like genre, this game hit all the right notes for me. While it leans more toward the action-RPG side, it incorporates enough souls-like mechanics to satisfy fans of both genres. The visuals are stunning, showcasing the power of Unreal Engine, although the downside is that even small patches can result in massive updates (the last one was 65GB).Overall, this game is an unforgettable experience, and I highly recommend it to fans of action-RPGs and mythological storytelling alike."
Positive,"100% this game with all the achievements, so i am qualified to tell you guys my review of this game. Its good"
Positive,"Absolutely phenomenal game, made me fall in love with the combat and once i beat this game i will be playing more of these types of games. Also if you beat big head, you have my respects."
Positive,"This combat system in this game feels really fluid and fun. I really like how you can re-spec your skill points (at save points) so you can try different strategies for beating the bosses.Epic writing/storytelling, beautiful visuals, tons of secrets, no micro-transactions.. They sold this game completed.10/10 - I'm going to be pissed if this isn't the game of the year."
Positive,"M o n k e h  supremacy.The game's story, combat, level design, music, grind level are all top notch for me and is very welcoming for those who have no experience with games that have souls-like elements and whatnot. Not to mention I really like mythology in games too."
Positive,Bought this game because some game journalist said not to.
Positive,monke see monke do
Positive,"”Ha ha ha ha ha, hello monkeys"" Frieza"
Positive,The combat is so fluid and fun. The people who made this game really love what they do and it's visible in the detail in the world.

Positive,this game is not souls-like but to me feels like it incorporates that into the game and is something different. If you enjoy souls-like games you may find yourself enjoying this one. I found the mechanics of this game to be a little difficult to getting used too. I tried playing both on controller and keyboard. I would only recommend this game if you have a controller to play with. The default keyboard controls felt like I was stepping on leggos with my hands.
Positive,"Love the game. Graphics are great, albeit hardware hungry. But you don't have to play it on ultra for it to look great. Gameplay is complex and fun - so far all the bosses and mini bosses were unique and different and in between it is simple but fun, too. All in all very nice game."
Positive,10/10 be the monkey
Positive,Highly recommend and the best story!!! 😭😭😭
Positive,"Reject modernity, embrace monke 🙈🙉🙊󠀡󠀡"
Positive,"I'm only a few hours into the game, and I swear, it's like re-learning Sekiro all over again, lol.But all in all, great game so far."
Positive,Medium Settings above recommended specs this game crashes frequently every 1-2 cutscenes even in compatibility mode early on in the game.Edit starts here after beating the game and the review changes to positiveCredits did still stutter and i hope they keep working on it.Great combat with complex options but also ways to keep it simple.Huge number of unique bosses with very few reskins. Reskins fight completely different and match the stage they are in.Aside from 1 level the game was fun to explore and get lost in. But its not very open and more branching paths leading to set encounters.I actually liked the story and i usually hate the story. Characters and Cutscenes are very good.Game gets difficult towards the end but i liked.
Positive,"To learn and appreciate the story To learn and appreciate the historyTo learn and appreciate the culture To learn and appreciate the team's hard workNo BS, No political rightness, It is what it is, a great game. Oh, and Fxxk all the western media and critics, go learn some other countries' culture and stop being idiots"
Positive,After my 2.6 hours of playing so far... I can say I love monkeys and hate china slightly less 👍
Positive,"It was well worth the 4 years of wait.Now, I'll finally be enjoying my monke moments and Chinese mythology while the western gaming industry is busy with taking notes."
Positive,Pretty difficult game but overall well built. Not bad for first AAA game from a start up studio
Positive,best single player game I've played in years!
Positive,Monke game good :)
Positive,"Feels like a proper AAA game. The storyline is post Journey to the West.Gameplay mechanics is quite intuitive, and requires some good timing to execute, which introduces some difficulty.Interesting bosses and storyline. Really good cinematics, with varying styles used to showcase them. The soundtrack used in the music videos are top notch and brings very strong emotions.As a chinese from Singapore who grew up watching journey to the west this made me really hyped for the game and what was more pleasant was the game exceeding my already high expectations for it.Rating: 9.5/10 for me"
Positive,Pretty cool game
Positive,magic monke  with  stick  and  homebrew 100 proof . 9.5/10

Positive,i normally don't do well or hate souls like games but this one clicks story is awesome game play is great and bosses while hard are not punishing love it
Positive,"In the recent years rarely have I got a game in which I just don't want to stop playing no matter how busy I am or how much work I have pending.This game is not flawless but it hits each and every mark that makes a game FUN for me. I am a Souls like snob so the combat was appealing to me even though it's not that hard (for the most part), but what sold me were the visuals and the presentation that this game encapsulates beautifully.The story is told through these gorgeous cut-scenes with superb art styles that convey the happenings and the past at the start of every chapter. Each of the story feels even better than the previous one and the characters and events represented in these are the highlights. The story and characters's lore goes very deep and is a great introduction to those who want to know more about The journey to the west.All that said no matter what, at the end of the day it is a game and as far as gameplay goes it is a very fun, mildly challenging and very rewarding game. It takes a bit of time to get used to the mechanics and just to the sheer quantity of them. The abilities are fun and the variety between enemies especially the bosses keeps this game always interesting. I feel like I'm a child again playing Dark souls 1 not having a clue what's around the corner and using 10 items just in sheer excitement and fear about what's to come next.Conclusion- For me it's an 8.5/10. If it didn't have some hiccups and performance issues it might have gone to a 9. I'm eagerly waiting for any DLC to give myself and excuse to start the NG plus."
Positive,"Visually beautiful, fun gameplay and a variety of interesting bosses.Some performance issues around stuttering and had trouble following the story but got the main point.Awesome game and highly recommend."
Positive,"10/10, What a Game."

Positive,"I am at the end of my 1st playthrough and I would like to recommend this game to anyone. I bought the game due to the hype, which of course was due to the release of the demo back in 2020 when there was a lockdown everywhere. The game looks ""open"" and the fight, the graphics was very very impressive from the demo.The game, was slightly disappointing at first as the game was pretty linear. I mean you can't get lost as the open world is not that open. Since I had spent over 3,300 hrs in Sekiro, I cannot help to find some similarity between the two games in terms of ""openness"". Also, some of the tasks or side quests involved back and forth among places. Without following playthrough videos, I am not sure if I can be where I am now in the game. True, I have made the decision to get 100% in my 1st playthrough so I followed playthrough videos. I was going to moan about it until I arrived at the final chapter. It is hugh and there is no hint whatsoever where and what to do next, especially now I can ""fly""!!! I have to give marks to those videos makers for their time to find things out otherwise I almost certainly will be lost and frustrated. Thinking about it, I suppose that this is their design strategy for ""longivity"", if not for the playthrough videos. Saying that, I have also found out that bosses have different moves in new game plus. And of course, one has to play NG+ because of achievements. Like Sekiro, certain resources are restricted, i.e. they cannot be farmed. Oh, just one important information for all interested new players, the Dev. has nerfed the drop rate of some important resources, not only that, they has added a condition that I personally have not come across in other game, which is that the longer if you stay in a location (due to farming), the drop rate which is already low, will drop even lower. I remembered before the last patch, I got so many precious resources without even trying to farm them. Now, I only got 1 out of 10 runs. Don't get me wrong, you can still farm but you will have to be really really patience.Like any other RPG games, one has to upgrade weapons, armours, items, to get stronger, more powerful. There are quite a few weapons but the Dev. has spent a lot of effort balancing them out. So, you gain some but you will lose some. But this is good, As the players will have to think how to build their Wukong. Oh, yeah, just a warning, you cannot change anything during a combat. Everything has to be set up prior to starting a fight. So, you will have to learn the enemies' moves and ability and then set up your Wukong accordingly. I guess that this is the fun and challenging part (on top of the fight).Similar to Sekiro, in order to play this game effectively and smoothly, you really have to do a lot of tinkering with your graphic settings. DO NOT assume that you have, say, a RTX4090, you can just go into the game at the highest settings and play smoothly. There are a lot of complaints blaming the game by people with RTX 40 series GPU. But using simple logic, I reckon that it is a combination of hardware and software. I have a laptop with RTX 3080 and Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU with 16 Gb RAM. So it is not top notch. But I spent about a couple of days researching and then tinkering, I can play the game smoothly, no problem at 74 FPS at 1K and 65 FPS at 2K (using my brother-in-law's 2K monitor at his home).Sorry, I digressed. Without giving away too much, the combat mechanics of the game can be clunky in certain area but mostly smooth. I guess this may be me not getting used to all the different fighting styles as I am more concentrated on getting all the achievements. So, my advice is to spend a lot of time on each fighting style. By the way, unlike the set up, you can change fighting style on the go. So, if you get experienced in all the different styles, the combat can be pretty impressive.Since I am a diehard fan of Sekiro (maybe Ghost of Tsuhima as well, soon), I cannot help to compare the three in terms of combat and the way players can progress in the game. In Sekiro, one is forced to ""gitgud"" in order to progress (as one has to defeat boss to get past and move on). Tsuhima, the progress of players' ability seems to be easier and more organised. And for Black Myth Wukong, hehe, there is XP farming. I mean I was already level 120 something half way through the game. So, I got through some bosses, not by skills but vitality, i.e. get hurt less. In Sekiro, farming XP only get you skills, not strength nor health so you still have to ""gitgud"". Tsuhima, there is not much farming as most enemies don't respawn after killing them. But upgrading skills can be really powerful, especially the stealth ones. Don't get me wrong. You still have to learn the enemies' moves in Black Myth: Wukong so you can learn the timing when to dodge and when to attack. You can't just go barging in. By the way, stealth is not an option in Black Myth: Wukong. You really have to learn to chain your moves in between dodging and healing in Wukong.Now the story, I thought that this game was loosely based on the infamous ""Journey to the West"" but in fact, it is more based on the book called ""Wukong Zhuan"" (loosely translate to biography of Wukong). Journey to the West was translated to English a few decades ago, but there is no English translation for ""Wukong Zhuan"". I only learnt of this a couple of days ago from a Youtube video posted by a Chinese looking lady from Canada. The video was actually about the explanation of the bad endings of this game. So, if you are interested, you can search for it in Youtube. And yes, in my opinion, according to her explanation and conclusions from ""Wukong Zhuan"", it is pretty ""dark"". I guess that is why the game is called ""Black Myth: Wukong"". Apparently, all the hints are actually in the game, from the conversations, mumblings of various NPC. I didn't take notice of most of it so I didn't know or rather what the story is trying to say. From the game, I only have the impression that Game Science have created a game telling how Wukong can be ""alive"" again. There no strong or obvious hints from objects within the game suggesting what was going on. It was all done by the mumblings and conversations in weird high pitch (which is a turn off for me). So, in my opinion, the story of the game is weak but the game itself is very strong and quite entertaining. I mean I will definitely get into NG+, NG++ and so on."
Positive,monke game good
Positive,"I love how the game combines action and exploration, but sometimes i just want to put Wukong in onesie and have him fight pillows. btw game is not that easy"
Positive,"This game is so good bosses are hard so I sometimes feel wrecked,  but girls characters are so cute especially the fourth sister , I love her. would recommend"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is something special. It is gorgeous mix of action, exploration, and storytelling that completely pulled me in. What stood out to me the most were the boss battles. There are so many of them, and each one feels different and challenging in its own way. The variety of enemies is insane too. Just imagine: every creature has its own touching backstory in the game's bestiary!You can definitely tell the developers were inspired by games like Dark Souls with the intense, thoughtful combat, and God of War for the sheer scale and epic feel of the action. But at the same time, Black Myth: Wukong feels totally fresh and unique because of its Chinese mythology and visual style. That blend of familiar and new kept me hooked the whole way through. The only thing that felt far from perfect to me was the presence of incredibly large, empty areas in the third part of the game. They invite exploration, but there’s no reward for doing so, which is really disappointing for a detail-oriented player like me.Last - but not the least - are six cartoons between each part of the game. Wow. They’re stunning - like mini-movies that not only look amazing but add so much to the story. Each one felt like a reward after a tough section, pulling me even deeper into Sun Wukong’s world. By the end, I was completely won over."
Positive,Great game! Not too difficult not too easy.

Thank you Chinese government, very cool!"
Positive,"The BEST game to release this yearit combines chinese mythology and souls-like genre in the best way possible.The visuals are jaw dropping, being probably the best showcase for Unreal Engine 5. Combat is one of the most enjoyable parts, there is a LOT of variety in spells, skills, weapons and play styles which are very fluid and well balanced.Even with no prior knowledge of Journey to the West, the characters and especially the chapter end animations do a really good job to keep you engaged and excited for what's about to come.The music is just cherry on top elevating the cinematic moments and fights to another level.one of the most perfect action/adventure games in recent times."

Positive,"I could go on about the maps being vast and beautiful but annoying to traverse and full of invisible walls; or enemy/encounter placement being uninspired and sometimes token; the story being hard to follow and important moments falling flat if you're unfamiliar with the source material... truthfully up until the last 2 chapters the game was gonna be a 6 or a 7 for me, but the last 2 chapters blow it out of the water!I think the game has its flaws, but it does so many things so well that the flaws are easy to ignore and the game is an easy recommendation."
Positive,"There’s a lot of hype around Black Myth: Wu Kong, and honestly, it totally delivers. I haven’t been this hooked on a game in a long time. The story is awesome, the cinematics are stunning, and the gameplay feels super smooth. I finished it 100% and even played through it three times because it’s just that good. The atmosphere, characters, and dialogue really stand out too. If you’re on the fence, trust me—it’s worth the hype, in my opinion."
Positive,"hey you defeated a boss! awesome here's a secret boss, oh you beat him too here's a mini boss! wow him as well? here's a really hard boss! that too? here's a bunch of mobs to fight on your way to the next boss with no shrine to heal with in between! i've gone through $300 worth of controllers, it's like having my own personal rage room!20/10"
Positive,i also have staff in my pants
Positive,MONKEY MONKEY MONKEY!!!!
Positive,"Stunning visuals, exceptional aesthetics, excellent atmosphere, and very fun gameplay all make for a wonderful experience! However, the game still has its issues, mainly, really uneven difficulty with some pretty tough difficulty spikes, which might prove too much for a more casual audience unfamiliar with Souls-like combat. Exploration also feels restricted with really obvious invisible walls and maze-like level design. And finally, the story is a very faithful interpretation of the Journey to the West; however, if you have no knowledge of the Chinese mythology, you will feel lost as the game keeps unveiling new characters, locations, and themes without proper introduction, ultimately making it feel like there is no ""self-contained"" narrative within the game (like in God of War, where the Norse mythology is just a background; you can understand Kratos story without any knowledge of the latter) and that the game is just an overview of the Chinese tale.Still, Wukong is a must-play and a GOTY contender!"
Positive,You cannot design a single action game better than Black Wukong. They have thought out everything I would have considered and wanted.
Positive,Superb storylines and graphic
Positive,it will be the game of the year
Positive,"This game was not my genre at all (only bought it because of the hype) but ended up being satisfying enough to make me start New Game+ and go over one more time for 100% achievements (that should say something). I can see why it's a Game of the Year contender for some. I'm happy to have bought this game, will play the DLC for sure! My experience overall exceeded my expectations.I didn't really like the game the first 1-2 hours because I was not used to a game having no mini-map and only be about fighting small mobs/ big bosses alternatively but I really grew to like it. I can really see why there is a fan base behind this style.This game stems from ""Journey to the west"" Chinese mythology (which I haven't read AND is not explained).Nevertheless, don't worry the game has some really cool art style and dialogues that makes you still enjoy it (makes you curious and read about the book actually which was my case).Cutscenes are great. Surprisingly great cinematography (loved the animations).Dodge mechanism still extremely satisfying after 80h+ !Bosses are well designed, and 10 or so actually give you a challenge to think about. Never got stuck too long so don't fear it being frustratingly difficult.Character movement and skillsets are truly fun (suits any play style I can think of). I also like that the character is mute (so I can have my own thoughts following a situation).Graphics are very nice (I played on ""high"" settings in general)Music very pleasant and culturally immersive.Oh and one last thing that needs to be said nowadays sadly: after 80h+ played I only encountered 3 minor bugs, great lunch, enough said!"
Positive,Best game I've played in years.
Positive,Funny Monke game.
Positive,"Great combat , great quests , good game ."

Positive,"I'm tired from repeating cycle of fight and death, but the reward is quite satisfying. Definitely game of the year for me."
Positive,"Very fun, Very hard, rewards adaptation and thought"
Positive,It is highly recommended for those who are interested in Chinese novels and mythology

Positive,best game ever
Positive,i like this game 1-for game play 9/10. 2-story 8/10. i didnt see any bug. everthing is perfect when run in 4k.combat system really good my problem with this game  I can't explore much in the game world
Positive,fun and challenging monkey bonk simulator
Positive,"Even with subtitles I don't understand, but this monke man can for sure fight"
Positive,"I am still playing but in 10hrs of gameplay I can say that the game is fantastic. If you are up for the challenge and constant dying to learn the boss tehniques and moves I say go for it!There are a lot of bosses, and I mean a lot. Every single one of them is different and special. I say take your time and don't rush it.Great job worth 60e."
Positive,"Game Science is really doing science in games, they made a """"JRPG"""" in soulslike and made success for basically making a game be an actual game and nothing else like other companies are doing nowadays. No paid early access, no in-game shop with microtransactions and zero DLCs.This game is truly the essence of gaming that everyone wants the industry to be, just making games fun again by literally making it be enjoyable and not just a money machine, and well, it seems that they made a LOT of money with it.If you're in doubt if it's worth playing or not, just go and give it a try. You certainly will enjoy the gameplay, all of the fun secrets and graphics of this game. It's really, really great and worth every second ~and money~ you spend on it!"
Positive,"GOTY 2024 hands down.Even beyond GOTY, doesn't even fucking need GOTY"
Positive,"A really great game, hope there's a sequel or a DLC to see what happens next.Had a lot of fun exploring and finding out Chinese lore and myths."

Positive,"With so much hype building up to the game’s release, Black Myth: Wukong had a lot of promises to fulfill. But I’m glad to say it fully delivered. Even exceeding expectations! The game boasts breathtaking visuals, showcasing diverse scenery and enemies alike. Its addictive combat system truly makes you feel like Wukong himself. And the masterful storytelling offers a deep, culturally rich tale.While it is true, if you know the source material this game is based off of: “Journey to the West”, you will notice numerous Easter eggs and references that build on existing lore, But it's certainly not required for you to enjoy the game to its full extent.Each chapter of the game tells a tale equally as captivating as the last. Filled with memorable boss fights with diverse mechanics that makes each battle a test of skill, giving us very rewarding progression. There are also many hidden side quests that weave back into the main storyline in surprising ways. So keep your eyes peeled at every corner!And that final boss of the game… wow, one of the most creative fights I've ever experienced. The amount of hidden lore and character journal entries will surely leave players eager to explore this world further. I look forward to any future DLCs or expansions and would recommend this game to anyone seeking an exceptional gaming experience or even just a great story.10/10"
Positive,Took me 74 hours to do a full completion of this game because I suck at games like this. But this game gets a 10/10 for me. Blew my expectations of what I thought this game was. The difficulty is hard for someone like me but I appreciate that you can respect talents at any time to try new strategies on bosses that are giving you a hard time.
Positive,"If you haven't read ""Journey To The West"" novel or watch any TV series, I would suggest you go and watch first before immerse yourself in this beautiful game. worth every second spent in it. Haven't finish the game yet. Just ended Chapter 4, just thought of giving it a review. Thank you Game Science for this incredible piece."
Positive,"An absolute masterpiece! The stunning visuals, captivating storyline, and fluid combat mechanics make it a must-play for any action RPG fan. Every moment in the game feels epic and immersive. This game sets a new standard for the genre and is a true testament to the power of creativity and innovation in gaming. Highly recommended!"
Positive,"Small edit: Keep the politics away from gaming, a gamer don't give a damn about dirty propagandas or politics,with that said lets talk about the game.This game delivered beyond anyone's expectations. This studio raised a bar really really high for their next work beyond anyone's expectations. This game was really refreshing,from the beautiful inviroments the really satisfying combat and the general representation of the Chinese mythology, I can't say much that many others haven't already said so I will keep this review short. This is easily the game of the year 2024,if you like a challenge but yet a game that feels fair at the same time with beautiful graphics and really good fighting mechanics this is the game for you. Did I mentioned that this will easily be the undisputed game of the year? Buy it already what are you waiting for???"
Positive,Game of the year!!!
Positive,With some issues but nobody can overlook its importance in reflecting the aesthetic concepts of Chinese culture. This must be the milestone of Chinese video game history.
Positive,"the graphics is enchanting. the combat is amazing. the story is epic. the characters are unique and everyone gives you a different experience. the variety of realms and lands are really insane and amazing. I for myself I think it is one the best games ever created, and I think it's gonna win game of the year easily.p.s. I wish other studios learn from this game how to deliver such good content. we are tired and disgusted of expensive trash."
Positive,"I'm 100% done with the game, fight everything, unlocks everything, yet somehow I just couldn't stop playing the game. I might need to go to a rehab meeting."
Positive,"Best bang for the buck game of the year, and no one can deny it."
Positive,Just finish the game with 100% Achivement/Progress.Enjoy almost all aspect in the game.MUST 2024 GOTY !# BE MONKE
Positive,Game of Merit
Positive,"One of the Best Games Ive ever played, story is interesting and enjoyable.."
Positive,"After finishing Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice with 100% completion, I thought no other game will be that good.My opinion changed when I started to play Black Myth Wukong. This game is as beautiful as it is hard.I recommend it 100% to at least try it out. It has beautiful scenery, intense combat and a wide variety of customization to please every play style you might have."
Positive,Mmmmmm... MonkeyMmmmmm... MonkeyMmmmmm... MonkeyMmmmmm... MonkeyMmmmmm... MonkeyMmmmmm... MonkeyMmmmmm... MonkeyMmmmmm... MonkeyMmmmmm... MonkeyMmmmmm... Monkey
Positive,Reject humanity. Return to monke.
Positive,"Since theres so many good things about this game Ill start with the only 3 gripes I had. Ill also say that the opening chapter of the game might give off the wrong impression of just how well crafted the overall experience is.-Invisible walls. There are numerous times you will see an area that looks traversable only to run in to an invisible wall. After a while you can get a feel for which areas are probably off limits but definitely not always. This plus wasted space (shown a decent amount in chapter 6) showcases the inexperience the devs might have with crafting a game of this scope.-Camera lock. Locking on will often have your focal point at the top of the screen rather than properly centered, thus making it harder to react to enemies. Oddly enough this seems to happen less to bosses.-Enemy AI. Some enemies desperately need to be more aggressive. Wailing on the Snake Sheriff enemy without him even flinching before dying is kinda sad. The blind monks carrying rocks are also fairly slow to respond before being taken out.That said the game is a gem. Its not a soulslike despite borrowing some core aspects. The best way to describe what the game is going for is a spectacle and it delivers 100%. There are some difficult boss fights but most bosses are honestly better considered an elite version of a regular enemy and a stepping stone for the Destined One on his journey. There is also WAY more enemy diversity than I ever expected the game to have. Some of the animated fights were just as enjoyable and impressive as the choreography in any martial arts epic. Graphically it looks amazing and thankfully the slight stutter doesnt seem to impact gameplay. The entire art style and scale that is tackled both serve to achieve the vision the games clearly going for, something that can fall short easily when trying to be this extravagant. Story wise it definitely helps to be at least somewhat familiar with the lore of Wukong and/or Journey To The West. At no point does the narrative hold your hand to explain character motivations. Reading entries in the journal absolutely help understanding whats going on more so thankfully you can at least follow along enough with those + a couple cutscenes later on in the game. Replaying the first two chapters after getting better acquainted with the story added clarity. It might be hard to follow but even just taking the story at face value with no external knowledge you should be able to piece together enough to see theres a lot of depth to be had. The animated cutscenes also completely caught me off guard and I found myself looking forward to the next one after each chapter.The best complement I can give this game is that overall it gave me a similar enjoyment to games I grew up with and stuck with me for years. Despite its flaws I would still give it a solid 10/10 and will now look forward to anything released by this studio the same way I do Fromsoft."
Positive,"""Monkey doesn't wear any pants""Song: MonkiBy Sposato"
Positive,such a great game
Positive,"Just gotta monkey around a bit. Hang in there, you'll eventually find your banana."
Positive,Monke Game good. It is an RPG game if the role you're playing is that of a victim.
Positive,"After finally completed all the achievement, what i can say is, i want more, please, i stream this game on twitch and complete all the achievement after newgame + new cycle 2 , i want more pleaseee, support me on twitch https://www.twitch.tv/willosmitty thank you GAME SCIENCE  for this game"
Positive,"Abort humanity, return to monke!"
Positive,"Good game to test my patience, you don't need to meditate to reach a peace of mind, all you need is Wukong."
Positive,"I connected with this game's art style, story, and controls almost immediately.   An unexpected surprise.  Compared to the dozens of unfinished games in my library.. this one I wanted to drink every drop right away.  Almost 80 hours later and ready for NG+ without feeling an ounce of fatigue.   Game of the year or it's time to just shut down the western game industry and start over."
Positive,"This is the game we all are expecting to have in 2024. Insanely beautiful graphics, no micro transactions, no huge open world that is as dead as Concord. I had no idea what is happening in main story, assume that you need to know Chinese mythology and classic story about monke but it I still enjoy the game. Loved the design of bosses and there are lots and lots of bosses in game, though they have quite simple move set battles are challenging enough and not as arse flaming like bosses in Elden Ring. The only thing I would like to have is some kind of mini map cause locations are quite big and you just forget where were you and where need to go. I wouldn't call Wukong game of the year but it is good to have a great game without wokenes and it is really a game worth spending a few hundred hours"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a true gem among action games that impresses on many levels. One of the most striking features of this production is its beautiful locations. Particularly noteworthy is the cave in Chapter 4, which is a true masterpiece. The play of light, rock details, and mystical atmosphere make exploring this place a pure pleasure.The combat system in Black Myth: Wukong is outstanding. Every battle is dynamic and requires precision and strategy from the player. The variety of moves and abilities that can be used ensures that combat never gets boring. It’s a true feast for action game fans.The game also offers a wide array of diverse bosses, each unique and challenging. Every boss has their own unique attacks and mechanics, making each fight different and requiring the player to adapt and think quickly.Furthermore, Black Myth: Wukong tells a story deeply rooted in Chinese mythology that captivates from the very beginning. The game not only provides entertainment but also educates, bringing players closer to the richness of Chinese culture and legends.In summary, Black Myth: Wukong is a game that impresses at every turn. Beautiful locations, an excellent combat system, diverse bosses, and a deep, mythological storyline make it a title that every action game enthusiast should have in their collection."
Positive,a phenomenal experience
Positive,ACT 3 HELL ASS AND BULLSHIT tho
Positive,Most fun I've had since Elden Ring.
Positive,it has lots of graghics
Positive,Around 100 bosses
Positive,3/5 on IGN because there's not enough Inclusivity and Diversity... 10/10 best game i've ever played
Positive,"Bro I suck so much at soulslike games, but this is the only game that made me want to get better and learn from my mistakes and succeed, and also the first one where after I finished I skipped the credits and jumped straight back into NG+. Honestly top 5 one the best games I've ever played. My life is so much better because of this game."
Positive,"The good:+ Fantastic graphics and art direction. Game is truly a visual fiesta.+ Runs surprisingly well despite being an Unreal Engine 5 game.+ Mostly banger soundtrack.+ Chinese voice acting is really good, English is passable.+ Very impressive enemy variety.+ Amazing boss fights and design. Some of them are infuriatingly difficult but overall the fights feel fun and challenging.The bad:- Incredibly basic and repetitive combat. You start the game by spamming X, you end the game by spamming X. That's right, you play the entire game with one combo. One. Single. Combo. WHERE ARE THE COMBOS GAME SCIENCE?!- Bad level design. Levels are large and gives you the illusion of exploration but there are invisible walls everywhere so you spend your entire time trying to find the right path.- Unless you're really familiar with ''Journey to the West'' the story doesn't make any sense at all.Final Score: 7/10 (Shout-out to Ranton)It's a good game, but just barely."
Positive,"after 48 hours and 70 ach, i can say this is GOTY for me. it has prolly my fav aspects in all of gaming into one. idgaf about ""souls likes"" ""action"" so those arent gonna be counted in my reviewevery boss is new, even the lil random ones no normal person would ever look to find. even on chapter 6 they made a boss you'd literally have to go through every chapter to get stones.the combat is uniqe for me as i havent touched the newist GOWfor me music is a main part of gaming and this passed with flying colors; the headless monk and the fighting music are TOP tier and deserve more praise then what it hassecrets: i didnt have to look up a tutorial ONCE this entire time, through all  3 of my play through's i havent been bored or ""stumped"" on a quest line or hidden boss. everything is shown in its own way or your told. graphics: VERY VERY pretty game, i put my shi on medium for that extra FPS boost in fights yk, but still it looked like i was playing on High or cinematic graphics"
Positive,FUCK  SWEETBABY!!!! THIS IS THE FUCKING REAL GAME!!
Positive,Good Monkey game
Positive,i want to be le monke
Positive,legit the best game ive ever played.
Positive,game of the year
Positive,"So this game got a 82 metacritic score , I am not sure what kind of weed were those journalists smoking but yeah , there's a bias here.The game is massive in scope , sometimes linear , sometimes semi-open world , from the very start it is clear about that.Combat has so much diversity , there are 3 stances , and so many spells , the game allows to respec at any time and switch to any other skill , so no worries into investing stats into specific skills , you can switch at any time.The storytelling is done through gorgeous drawn cinematic , ingame cinematic and especially through the journal , each boss , character the player meets gets added to the journal , in order to follow the story and understand what's going on , one must read the journals , it seems a lot of ""gaming"" journalists skipped that part as they perhaps cannot read. Reading the lore of Journey through the West is highly suggested for more immersion. This is the first time I read about it and it has been a cool story to follow.The game is not perfect, it has certain issues , I think they should add a minimap to have less confusion , another issue I had is there is missable content , unless you check a guide , it will be hard to see all the content in one playthrough   ( especially horseguy quest throughout many chapters )  The devs do not want to label this game as soulslike but it kind of is , with similar spawn points and stamina management, it is difficult at times, and there's so many bosses with different movesets , +80 bosses and 90 other enemies.Clearly, a lot of love and effort has been put into the game , from the gorgeous design and atmosphere, the music , and theatrical stroytelling, this could be game of the year.I'd give this at least a 9/10"
Positive,"Easily one of my favourite games of the year. The combat is fantastic. Story is as you'd expect if you know journey to the west. Exploration and bosses are off the charts though. Really feels like god of war with monkeys. They did a brilliant job, and it's really fun to play."
Positive,"This is a masterpiece, the art, the music, the plot, the lore, and the deep meaning behind each chapter that make people think!This is GOTY for me!!!!!!!"

Positive,Classic Chinese masterclass
Positive,Black Myth is undoubtedly the most successful game of the year
Positive,way more of this please :D thank you ( companies letting devs actually make a good fucking game that's playable on launch and that doesn't rely on tending to a certain group of people and agenda in an attempt to ensnare players into playing their dogshit fucking game *cough* con *cough* cord )Game science genuinely joined Grinding gear games and fromsoft at the top in a singular game10/10 Goty
Positive,"(This is my review after having 99% the game with a few achievements to clean up as well having finished NG+)I'm probably not the only one who saw a trailer/teaser for this game some time back in 2018/2019 thinking it was a damn good looking game, only to be surprised when it launched thinking ""oh shit, I forgot all about this game"". At least in the East, we saw virtually no advertising of this game. At first I was a bit skeptical as the studio only worked on mobile games previously, but this has been quite a work of art and such an incredible experience.First to break the ice: I would not consider this a souls-like by definition, but it is a difficult game and you will be punished for making mistakes. You can somewhat brute force your way through the game but it certainly helps save time to figure out the enemy's attack patterns and understand your toolkit, especially if you want to do the secret bosses. If you ever want to swap builds to specifically fight bosses this game lets you freely respec which is such an amazing design choice.Graphically, this game is fantastic, it's very pretty and visually appealing with distinct biomes for each chapter that fit so well. The characters/enemies you encounter are detailed, creative, and are memorable. The story can be hard to follow but nothing a few youtube videos can't solve!There's a lot of bosses in this game, 90+ if I recall. Some are pushovers, some are incredible, some are poorly designed but what I find most interesting about the encounters is how wildly people's opinions vary fight-to-fight. Sure, some fights are overwhelmingly agreed on being hard (Erlang, Yellow Loong, Broken Shell, etc.), but the fact everyone has wildly different experiences playing this game goes to show how variable the fight design is across the board which I love. Most of the fights felt fair, only a few felt kinda BS by design. Expect to take a few attempts on each, and a lot more for the hidden ones.There are a few things I did not like which were mainly related to achievements (Fuck you Jade Lotus soak), invisible walls, and I wish we had some kind of map especially when first discovering an area. I got lost a fair bit in Ch.4 trying to figure out where tf I was. NG+ was also a bit too easy for me, every boss fell over which I heard is solved after NG+++, but I don't have the willpower to go all the way to that point.This is likely going to be GOTY and a must-buy for me. I really hope Game Science does a DLC at some point in the future but this is certainly a studio I'm looking forward to seeing what they can do."

Simply one of the best games I have ever played. One thing to be amused at the first sight is the graphics. Unreal Engine 5 really did its thing to this game, as I can enjoy many beautiful landscapes, even better with NVIDIA Full Ray Tracing set on. Providing Frame Generation feature also helps render Cinematic preset at 1440p without frying my 4070 Ti to ashes (Mostly I turned it off, sometimes I turned it on to see the comparison). The gameplay itself is exciting. I felt similar excitement to Elden Ring and Souls games, but with less punishing boss fights. The bosses were almost never boring, unique movesets, pattern that I can never predict, awesome design too! Though one thing that I find it irritating is the invisible wall, which confuses me alot during exploring side quests, side bosses, etc. I could yap about other things that makes this game the biggest GOTY contender, but the checkboxes above should give you the gist of it.When Sekiro and God of War had a baby, you are obliged to put your money to experience PEAK ART. 10/10"
Positive,"Excellent game. Story is deep and well thought, especially for people familiar with the Journey to the West story and 1986 TV series. Character design and graphics is extremely well made. Combat is not as hard as Soul like game but still challenging. On the other hand, the gameplay offer more diverse playstyle with spell, stances, transformation and you can change your style at any time you want."
Positive,Just finished the game. What a beauty of a game. I had fun even when I was losing battles with bosses. The combos are good. The whole game looks gorgeous in unreal engine. Definitely has replay value as I'm completing my second playthrough. GOTY so far for me.
Positive,A games game. Souls formula but forgiving with more rpg elements . outstanding .
Positive,This is some serious monkey business. full stop
Positive,It is a super good game. I like the bosses design. They are beautiful and challenging.
Positive,china numba 1
Positive,10/10 Getting lost in its visual has become a thing for me. Game play is hard and solid. Makes you want more and more as you play it. Loving it !
Positive,"This game is amazing! Every scene feels like you're on a virtual vacation, exploring beautiful landscapes. I can't wait for the DLC to come out!"
Positive,"They did dodging superbly this game. The satisfying sound cues and animation for perfect dodges is it's own reward. I kept trying to hit those perfect dodges even when I don't need to and ended up dying lol. 9/10 from me. Just really needed a map and less invisible wall.Btw I just wanna say, more games should do story telling like this. It's just amazing. beautiful animated cutscenes after each chapter boss. I loved each short story. It's like a reward for sticking through the hardest of battles."
Positive,"Great to see what Chinese game developers can push out instead of mobile and gacha games. One of the most aesthetically pleasing and beautiful games I have ever played. Crazy how people are saying there is a lack of diversity in this game and that it should fail due to that, get a life 😂"
Positive,"Buy it on a sale.I really enjoyed most of the game, but it's not perfect. Positives:The atmosphere and aesthetics are hard to come by. I normally shy away from ""Souls"" like games, but I was interested in the subject matter. It's got mythos overflowing, and it's refreshing to see something that is beyond a general ""Dark Fantasy"". Environments look great for the most part and enemy design was built around ""Journey to the West"" which is different.Optimized well- not perfect, but runs well RPG mechanics- Interesting leveling up mechanics that mostly hits the mark.The chapter ending cutscenes/music- Each chapter has it's own unique style of telling a folk story that draws from the main story, all segments are vastly different in animation style which is really cool. Depressing stories mostly, but I had zero desire to skip any of the cutscenes. The Bosses are pretty much the highlight of this game. Varied and all of them feel handcrafted by the developers. This is probably the most bosses I've encountered in a game. Majority of them are quite manageable and are certainly satisfying to beat. Zhu Bajie is great and his presence in the game made it so much better. Negatives:Some of the in between boss battles content is a slog. I get farming experience, but sometimes the encounters were braindead easy or obnoxious due to the multitude of enemies that pop up. You want to avoid using spells on encounters like this due to how frequently the game cuts into boss battles, luckily shrines are everywhere, but it makes it does feel drawn out from time to time. Chapter 6 looks good, but I wanted it to be over by the time you start navigating it. Navigating the level without much sense of direction was a pain and despite adding a cool feature at this point, the design was confusing to get around. This and the vast amount of invisible walls sometimes felt like I was bumping around in a maze of an ultimately unfinished level. Some aspects of the RPG mechanic trees are convoluted, possibly poorly translated. Some perks I gained I honestly had no idea what it improved. Some boss battles are ridiculous, they feel borderline cheating. While most of the battles are extremely fair (I don't play Souls games, I'd normally dip out around chapter 3), some bosses seem to have little to no sense of pattern. I managed to get through a large majority of the bosses, but it was a struggle that sometimes felt unnecessarily padded out. For example, a few of the bosses force you into locked sequences where you are injured, they then proceed to nuke you right out the gate. Some of them have obnoxious stat mechanics (pagoda tower). I expect people to just tell me to suck it up and get gud, but here's the biggest issue with the game:Difficulty. The difficulty is probably far far easier than a Souls game, but far more difficult than your average action slash game. I have a feeling Souls fans will think this wasn't much of a challenge, meanwhile average players might just give up because of the difficulty (especially if they don't know anything about Journey to the West). I locked in simply because I like the subject matter, but the story kinda expects you to already know about Wukong. This creates a fairly large barrier for people interested in the world, but suck at games like Dark Souls. Ultimately, I think most people going into the game will think it was alright, but I'm not entirely sure it will keep a base for a sequel (really doesn't need one, but you know how games go these days). Like I said, I suck at souls games, I beat it, but I do see where $60 might be a bit too steep for a mostly good game with a rather steep learning curve for casual players, meanwhile Souls fans might be put off with how simple the gameplay is. You'll be button mashing the light attack and roll for majority of the game, it doesn't get much deeper than that. Is it a solid game, absolutely, I'm happy I stuck with the game, however I strongly suggest going into the game at least somewhat knowledgeable of the source material, I think for most casual players that really will determine if you like it or not, meanwhile I expect people into the hardcore difficulty genre of games to breeze right through it and consider it pretty simple and probably not  entirely worth $60. TLDROverall solid game based on the Wukong story with clear passion put into it. There are a number of things I disliked about the game but the Destined One and Bajie's journey is well worth the time investment, but I would suggest getting on sale or at least watching a few gameplay videos to see if it's for you."
Positive,اللعبه جميله جدا
Positive,great story and combat just a pure game like in the old days
Positive,"Great game and it is like watching a childhood hero comes to life. Despite you speak Chinese or not, definitely recommend to play it in Chinese dub !"
Positive,Love pretty much everything about this game but especially the combat is just so fluid and fun. One of the most rewarding games too as it feels so good beating baddies and is never feeling cheap on either end. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking on top of everything else so highly rec this game. Enjoy!
Positive,"Absolutely enjoyed playing this game. Insane story telling and cinematics, Amazing combat system and to top it of the game is well optimized from launch. Only problem this game is the lack of some type of map. Even though its a ""linear"" game, when you start exploring in chapter 3 and after it starts getting really complex in-terms of exploring and you easily miss out on items and even questlines unless you specifically look for guides on youtube and forums to not miss them, other than that its a really solid 7.7/10 game. Would recommend."

Positive,"Amazing game, full of passion, fun and engaging combat, and beautiful pieces of art. A visual treat both in-game and in the animated cutscenes. Don't let internet drama turn you off playing. Try it and judge it based on your experience. I always wanted to experience the story of Journey to the West, and as an action RPG fan this game gave me exactly what I wanted. If you're already a longtime fan of Sun Wukong that will only heighten the experience, I'm jealous of those people lol. Easily my GOTYTL;DR: Game gud, give it a fair shake. You just might like it"
Positive,"Combat feels nice and fun. The boss designs are interesting and cool to look at. And the setting is phenomenal. I love the varied ways you can play your character. It somehow manages to toe the line between simple and complicated in the forms of the focus point system, magic, and might as well as the different staff stances. And being able to re-spec at any point at a shrine feel so good.Love the game so far, and im really interested in the lore and how the story will end! It was hard to put it down to go to sleep."
Positive,"it's epic in every sense of the wordeach chapter better and betterone of the best games I've ever playederlang, four heavenly kings and the final boss fight were absolute cinema"
Positive,Mantap BAGUS catatan SSD WAJIB
Positive,"I originally kept my expectations very low cause it seemed too good to be true especially with this being the studios first game, but having played a little bit of the game so far this game just blew it out of the park! There's nonstop action which I love with lots of enemies and as well as a ton of bosses and the combat is insanely fun. The game truly feels like a piece of art, the studio clearly put everything into this game and it truly paid off cause the game is just incredible, amazing story so far, very pretty, incredible combat, oh and the boss fights are some of the best boss fights I've seen and experienced in any video game before!"
Positive,Game of the year
Positive,"55 Hours in : I'm in the last chapter of the game, here's the review so far - its the best boss rush game out right there, its elden ring without the boring parts, its god of war with better mechanics, ITS MADAFA KING SUN WUKONG UP IN THIS B****You actually need skill to play this game and have fun.10 out of MADAFA KING 10"
Positive,"The visual presentation of ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is stunning, with high-level art production shown in the game's scene design and character models. However, the issue of invisible walls in the game can be somewhat immersion-breaking, sometimes making players feel restricted. Despite this, overall, the quality of the game is still quite considerable."
Positive,game ufcking sucks
Positive,"Reject modernity (You don't hate game journalists enough). become... MONKE. EZ GOTYThis game is just amazing, giving gamers what they want pays off, isn't that crazy?"
Positive,fantastic game but some bosses are absolute trash :D
Positive,"I like the combat mechanism. The advantage's that it’s based on abilities of monkey king In Journey to the West, less difficult, still challenging though. I quite enjoyed fighting till the end.The story’s told with an effort. Anime between chapters is impressive. I hardly see any other ARPG games did that.The biggest flaw is scenes. I guess scenes are far bigger than they’re supposed to be, perhaps just for visual effect. There are many lights. They often switches on and off,  in and out of caves or shadows, without any transition. Another issue is invisible walls, so many of them that I felt laziness behind. They aren’t a good solution to whatever problem developers have, and they can be really annoying sometimes, which hurts the exploration part of the game.7.5/10"
Positive,One of the best of all time!
Positive,"I’ve never been so utterly blown away, yet simultaneously so unbelievably frustrated by a game as I have been with Black Myth: Wukong. This is, undoubtedly, one of the most ambitious and impressive action games I’ve played. It’s stunningly gorgeous; its combat is fantastic; it's incredibly challenging, but always satisfying to overcome; and the setting is refreshingly unique and steeped in rich Chinese culture, just to sing a few of its praises"
Positive,im only 3 hours in but i think this game is kinda gay cause theres no women. very lgbt friendly
Positive,Yellow Royal Sage = worst boss
Positive,10/10 - Game of the year
Positive,"Absolute Banger. Combat is rewarding and satisfying, the vast majority of bosses are really enjoyable and surprisingly innovative, and both visually and aesthetically stunning. There's a lot of tools to make the game easier, so its not as grueling as other souls-likes, but despite being more of a souls-lite it's still got some heavy hitters in the boss department. Definitely recommend."
Positive,Meet Sun Wukong! The inspiration for half the anime's you love! Monkey D Luffy? Son Goku? Even Naruto with the shadow clones? what about how Ichigo goes to the soul society and fights the captains? sounds like sun wukong to me! Amazing GraphicsStylish Gameplay and less boring like others you are used toAmazing cut-scenes and storylineFilled with plenty of exploration for the single player lover!The only negative (which isn't really a negative) is I can't use Nezha =(
Positive,"This game is absolutely stunning! I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games with amazing graphics and hard but easy to learn combat. Though, the only downside is I would 100% say that they put the most effort into the beginning of the game than the middle and end of the game. The game kinda goes downhill after the second chapter of the game. Still would say this is a fabulous game and I'm still enjoying the game. 10/10 game!"
Positive,"I'm going to be Brutally honest. This game is going to be in the Top 10 of games of 2024. It's crazy how good the graphics are and the combat. I was enjoying a lot of the side quests that were in the game and I was having a lot of fun.  Please don't get me wrong, most of the fights are awesome and the cinematic art was really enjoyable to watch. I personally hated that I was backtracking through the game because I missed a key item or forgot to hand a quest item. A lot of the best items in the game are required for you to explore and find clues but sometimes they are well hidden to the point that looking up a guide is like the best option. It also bums me out that we only get three stances in the game when in the last one we get a really cool stance but we do not get to keep only for that one section that bums me out and Chapter 6 does some of the exploration well but it would have felt better if a lot more was in that area. To fight or explore like some ruins or a secret area that we could do before hitting the last stretch. I mostly did everything in the game so I can say that it was a lot I wanted more out of a fight or a battle. Some of the main story bosses are a breeze to get through while the ones that I had explored and found way more scary. The story itself I was having a somewhat hard time following. I kinda got the Idea but it felt lacking in some aspects. Honestly I was having a better time fighting and discovering secret places that would give me a new form or power. I was invested more in the fights than I was the story not sure if anyone felt the same as me in that part. It's still a very good game. If I had to score Black Myth wukong it would be an 8/10, Elden Ring for me was a 9/10. I enjoyed playing it and I think that a lot of people will love this game if they are looking for an action game that has just the right amount of hand-holding and challenge I want to really say that this game was a fun but the year is not over and we have plenty of games that are gonna scratch an itch for everyone. This is not Game of Year but it most definitely will be on My top 10 list of 2024 for me."
Positive,Dont like to write reviews but this was a banger. Has some of the best fight combos and builds in any game ive played

Positive,"amazing music, very good twist to the original lore yet respectful to source material. boss fights are fantastic. highly recommend if you love sekiro (note: sekiro is still the much harder game). 100/10"
Positive,GOTYAll games should look like this minimum.All games should play like this minimum.
Positive,"One of the best single player games I've ever played. It's challenging but not frustratingly so. Some bosses were stupid hard, but were manageable. The game rewards exploration with items that make some of the hardest fights a cakewalk. Couldn't recommend the game enough"
Positive,"Stone Monkey strong togetherJust finished the game with most of the content done. Graphics, gameplay, enemy design and soundtrack are phenomenal for the people still on the fence. If they should get it because it may be too hard for them, I would put it on the same difficulty as Darksouls 1 or the early parts of Elden Ring."

Positive,"During this holiday, although I am at home, it seems as if I have been to countless places in China. The game has truly amazed me with its stunning recreations of the magnificent landscapes across the country. Developer has demonstrated extraordinary craftsmanship and dedication. Every detail of the beautiful mountains, serene waters, and ancient architectures is vividly presented, making me feel as if I am truly immersed in these wonderful places. They have managed to capture the essence and charm of China's great rivers and mountains, allowing players like me to experience the breathtaking beauty without leaving home. Kudos to Developer for their remarkable efforts in bringing the splendor of China to our screens."
Positive,Monkey with stick 10/10
Positive,Black Myth: Wukong ! ! ! 10/10 I could never recommend a better action RPG.Music: 10/10Story: 10/10Combat: 11/10Difficulty: 10/10Abilities-Powers-Armor-Weapons: 12/10Level Design: 20/10I'm only Three chapters in and I'm loving every moment of it. The game lets you flex your creativity on how you'd like to approach a boss fight and I respect the hell out of that. It's the love child of of Souls games and God of War and they take the best elements of each one and combine them into something truly unique. I can't praise the developers of this game enough. They've brought to life a story that is so incredibly important to some beloved anime-shows-movies. Thank you for respecting your audience and creating something beautiful.
Positive,"Brilliant...I keep dying over and over again, I want to smash my screen every few minutes and maybe start crying.....highly recommend it!!!"
Positive,This is the first Black Myth: Wukong game where you can become Black Myth
Positive,Has the best graphics in 2024.
Positive,"Great graphics even on low/medium, great story, amazing voice acting, amazing soundtrack, very very fun combat, and lots of monkey noises. Kinda cpu intensive but still manages to pull off 110 fps if set to high priority for cpu + hardware accel and mostly medium graphics. The first fight/cutscene tanks really bad but performance picks up when you load into the first chapter. Other than that GOTY best monkey, beats apewar 100%, best game of the 2020's, makes me feel like a kid again, boss rush soulslike that isn't anywhere near as stressful as dark souls or ER but still manages to keep you engaged and trying. :steamhappy::steamhappy::steamhappy::steamhappy:"
Positive,monkey staff bonk
Positive,"me like monkey, me like game"
Positive,one of the best game ive ever played
Positive,"This is another decisive proof that ppl don't need diversity and lecturing on western morals in a game, only a nice story and good gameplay. I wish I could say ""AAA"" companies can learn from it, but I know they won't, just like they didn't learn by BG3's and Elden Ring's example."
Positive,肝了四十个小时左右（有20小时是忘记退出计入的），目前85级 第五章除了隐藏关卡快打完了。全成就估计是没时间搞了，但是通关应该问题不大，还是比魂类游戏容易不少，我之前都是玩塔防或者策略类游戏或者英雄联盟，很少用手柄打游戏，但慢慢也习惯了，预告片里出现过的很多boss都很不错，比如灵虚子 黑熊精 虎先锋 四条小龙 黄眉 刀狼等。黑熊精/虎先锋/黄风大圣/小黄龙/毒敌大王 都是卡了20次的主。估计打完一周目就不会花时间多次通关了。感谢游戏科学这么多年来的精心制作，期待dlc的内存。
Positive,真不戳，可玩到第三章我的 mac 实在带不动了，白色的雪都渲染成绿色的了... 显卡到了再战
Positive,Ungo Bungo Monke Smash
Positive,game is easy but the combat gets really satisfying once you unlock good stuff and get the flow.
Positive,A guy with no head shows up and starts playing some of the best music you've ever heard
Positive,"As someone who hasn't played many Souls-like games before, this game does a great job of creating an engaging environment and reasonably challenging boss fights that can satisfy any type of player. The mythology of Journey to the West provides an excellent base material for the developers to build on, and the game surely lives up to the fame of the source material. (insane environment design + top tier graphic)"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a visual feast, teeming with rich details that animate the story. The narrative is a spellbinding journey that keeps you engrossed from the beginning to the end. The variety of monsters and bosses in the Xi You Ji story arc poses unique challenges and deepens the game's narrative. As a player who hasn't delved into many Souls-like games, I initially had concerns about the difficulty. However, Black Myth: Wukong strikes a great balance, allowing for mistakes and providing opportunities for players to learn and improve after a few attempts. This balance not only makes the game more accessible but also makes the moments of triumph, especially after a challenging boss fight, incredibly satisfying. It does have some flaws, like others mentioned, such as countless air walls and transitions from dark to bright environments, but this is still an excellent game that offers a fantastic experience. Special credit to Guangzhi from me. Thank God for Guangzhi. Without him, I would never have been able to see what the infamous Tiger Vanguard looked like."
Positive,"Awesome game so far 6hrs in or so. Graphics are great and battles are fun. Some times if I'm not paying attention, monsters will jump out of nowhere and attack me, made me jumped and definitely kept the suspense environment going. Love the open world- vast lands/dark caves/desolated villages/forests. I am lost most of the time. Wish the game has a map...The only thing I've noticed that helped is the floating lights that'll guide you to the saving point/resting alters before bosses. Game is great when playing with a controller. I loved Journey to the West and was hyped when this game came out. Now I get to see another side of Journey to the West from a different point of view while having fun playing the game."
Positive,"Difficulty: 6/10Black Myth: Wukong strikes a balance that makes it accessible to players who are new to the Souls-like genre. The 6/10 difficulty rating might seem low, but it reflects the game’s approachable nature, ensuring that even those without prior experience won’t find themselves stuck on a single boss for hours on end. This approachability doesn’t detract from the challenge, making it enjoyable for both newcomers and veterans alike.Graphics: 10/10Visually, Black Myth: Wukong is a masterpiece. The game is stunningly clean and highly enjoyable, with every detail meticulously crafted. The visuals immerse you in a vibrant world that’s both rich and atmospheric, showcasing the power of modern gaming hardware.Boss Design: 10/10One of the standout features of Black Myth: Wukong is its exceptional boss design. Each boss is unique, not just in appearance but also in mechanics. This variety is rare in games with such a large number of bosses (over 90), where repetition often becomes an issue. Here, each encounter feels fresh and challenging, keeping the gameplay exciting from start to finish.Map Design: 7/10The map design is solid, though it doesn’t reach the heights of some open-world games. While it’s understandable given the game’s structure, some of the level blockages don’t feel entirely smooth or natural. However, the game still offers a well-crafted world that’s enjoyable to explore, even if it’s not the most open or free-flowing.ConclusionBlack Myth: Wukong is a game that’s definitely worth picking up, especially with the hype surrounding it. It promises hours of engaging content, offering a mix of accessibility, stunning visuals, and intricate boss battles that few games can match. Whether you’re a fan of the genre or new to it, there’s something here for everyone.GOTY Incoming"
Positive,the yellow wind sage is worse than the dragon god from demon souls
Positive,"I haven't been this pissed when playing a game since Dark Souls 1, 2 and 3! Great game 10/10"
Positive,Monke here. Monke there. Monke everywhere. Monke
Positive,"10/10, worth the wait"
Positive,"Its a really enjoyable experience. the game play, scenery, boss fights, quests are all on point.The skill tree system can get a bit overwhelming but that not a bad thing.The combat definitely has a learning curve. you cant just button mash and expect to execute perfect combos every time. you need to pair the all the attacks and skills at the right time for smooth combos.My only critique is that the skill descriptions could be a bit more clearer in their meaning, i found myself questioning how the skills worked after reading through the description multiple time.9/10. monkey monkey monkey"
Positive,"Freaking good, but still need better map design and translationHope more people will be interested in  Journey to the West"
Positive,Yes 100% recommend
Positive,monkey with a big stick
Positive,"My first souls like game ever. I just killed a boss. Took me like 30 times before i managed to get it down. I often go into mashmode, this isnt that type of a game. I will try better to slow down the pace. So far so good."
Positive,---{ Where is the road }---☑ 10/10
Positive,amazing game I recommend it for everyone
Positive,"Well done, not boring every new skill and fight mechanic are there to be learned not be ignored wow"
Positive,"A livello grafico (se giocato con un hw adeguato) e' uno dei giochi piu belli ci siano in circolazione. Modelli poligonali, texture e animazioni sono dettagliatissimi; la direzione artistica e' spettacolare, una varieta' di personaggi impressionante, tutti ben fatti e fedeli alla tradizione della leggenda a cui si ispira.Ci sono ancora delle sbavature qua e la in termini di artefatti e prestazioni ma nulla che non sia risolvibile con qualche patch.Il gamplay a mio avviso si piazza a meta' strada fra un God of War e un Elden Ring, la struttura dei livelli e' sostanzialmente a corridoi, bellissimi corridoi ma... corridoi, un po come God of War; ogni tanto ci sono scorciatoie e aperture che lasciano un po piu liberta' di esplorazione e che spesso nascondono qualche segreto, questo stempera un po la brutta sensazione data dai muri invisibili.Si incontrano boss e mini boss frequentemente e questo fa si che il ritmo sia quasi sempre alto, la difficolta' varia molto in base alla build che ci si e' costruiti  e da boss a boss, al momento sono alla fine del secondo capitolo e nessun boss e' risultato frustrante ma qualcuno discretamente impegnativo, in generale lo trovo un ottimo bilanciamento per ora.E' un gioco che pur entro i limiti della sua struttura e' evidente che sia stato curato tantissimo e questi dev meritano tanta stima, specialmente considerando che e' il loro primo prodotto e che hanno dovuto anche sorbirsi le seghe al cervello della subcultura woke occidentale di oggi. BRAVI!"
Positive,Monke of War?!
Positive,The game has that feeling I had when I first played Elden Ring. Constantly wanting to play more of it! It definitely is difficult at times so don't expect some ez pz game. 10/10 would recommend this game.
Positive,One of the  best games I've played in a good amount of years!!!!
Positive,the baby made me crash out
Positive,aproape ca sparg tot dar inca mai pot
Positive,Great performance at release and practically no bugs. Amazing game if you liked God of War since the gameplay is very similar.(Edit: After seeing the final boss and unlocking the true ending this is just a straight up masterpiece. My expectations were far more than just surpassed)
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a story about a monkey who wanted to be free. A monkey that made mistakes, the story is about his friends and his journey and us the destined one as we complete that story in one way or other. This is possibly the best video game I have ever played in my life and I can confidently say that this game slaps hard. It is truly phenomenal. The audio, effects, artwork, battles, upgrades, and transformations are all top-notch. Easily 10/10.GAME SCIENCE PLEASE GIVE US A SEQUEL I BEG YOU."
Positive,"Not a big fan of ARPG where I have to keep on dodging to survive, but for someone like me who loves and enjoy Chinese mythology; this Chinese Odyssey (Journey to the West) inspired video game, this is one of the few games that I can't just stop to admire. From the game play to scenery to story telling. (I have skill issue so I cherish every mini boss & boss kills ) This game is def one of the top tier games of 2024. PS play it in Chinese dub and have it in English sub it feels more right. Pros4/5 - Visuals4/5 - Audio is eargasm Spoiler alert ( you'll love everyone specially the Headless Monk, except your current char which feels like a GTA:O char, best you can do is sigh )5/5 - Story Telling5/5 - Game playCons0/5 - No feminist Agenda0/5 - Politics are banned, but Buddhas and Ashuras reigns. 0/5 - Not human friendly0/5 - Monke cannot climb a tree. 0/5 - No monke butt scratching nor poop throwing0/5 - Harambe is not included in game."
Positive,"This is the best game I've played this year and it's incredible.The only frustrations I had with this game were at the beginning where chapter 1 appears to be a bit of a boss crawler. Once you get past this section the game opens up and it's just amazing.I thought I wouldn't enjoy the weapon as when I play Dark Souls I primarily go for a straight sword, but you quickly get used to the way this staff performs and enjoy it. Graphically, immense. Some of the lighting from the outside in caves is truly breathtaking and the forests within this game the best I've probably ever seen in gaming. The story is great and the bosses are all uniquely different and challenging, but not impossible.10/10 !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Positive,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)Black Myth: Wukong is nothing short of breathtaking. From the moment you step into its richly detailed world, it's clear that this is a game created with immense passion and an eye for artistry. The game draws heavily from Chinese mythology, offering a fresh narrative perspective that stands out from the usual fantasy fare. As someone who's been following its development since the first trailer, I can confidently say the wait was worth it. It’s a challenging, visually stunning game that respects the player's intelligence and rewards persistence. While it may not be for everyone, particularly those who shy away from tough combat, it's a gem for those who embrace the challenge."
Positive,"Finally a game that is not ""too good to be true"". One of the best games i have ever played.I just wish there where more open world space. But other than that, it's a solid 9.5/10 THB"
Positive,"This review contains some spoilers, so please proceed with caution. Based on my gaming evaluation system, the following comments and ratings are purely subjective.Personal subjective rating after completing the first playthrough: 7.5/10Setting aside the controversies and discussions outside the game, I believe Black Myth: Wukong is an ARPG with significant shortcomings.Many have praised the game's strengths so I won't dwell on them. Instead, I'll focus on discussing the game's flaws.Firstly, the game has severe performance issues, particularly on the PS5 (Digital Foundry has done an in-depth analysis . At the start of the game, there is a lengthy shader compilation process. I completed my first playthrough on a PC with a 7800X3D and RTX 3090, and honestly, even in small areas (where there's no need to use cutscenes to load sections), I experienced frequent frame time spikes (i.e., sudden minor stutters), which was very annoying. In areas requiring cutscene loading, the stuttering was even more severe. I suspect this might not be an isolated issue. Although there are still relatively few games made with UE 5, considering the performance of UE 4, this kind of frame time stuttering seems to be a common issue. However, the development team's optimization efforts are clearly inadequate and require much more work.As for the storyline, setting aside the controversies over Black Myth's alleged disrespect for the original work's core spirit, I believe that as long as the adaptation is reasonable and self-consistent, it can be acceptable. However, the plot of Black Myth can be described as mediocre, with characters lacking substantial story development and sufficient motivation for their actions. I find it hard to understand how the development team put so much effort into the game's monster compendium, crafting numerous deeply meaningful side stories, yet the main plot remains bland. The entire story can be summarized as the protagonist collecting the remnants of Sun Wukong and becoming the new Great Sage. Note that this mechanical reductionism conclusion is flawed. If the cost of fragmented storytelling is to weaken the narrative, I don't think that's a wise decision. The characterization of the protagonist, The Destined One, is even weaker. By the end of the game, we still know very little about the protagonist. Of course, one could argue that this was done to allow players to self-insert themselves into the character, but I wouldn't say I like this kind of protagonist. The protagonist is merely a tool the development team uses to advance their dull storyline. It could even be said that the portrayal of the companion, Zhu Bajie, who appears mid-game, is far more vivid than that of the protagonist.The map design has faced widespread criticism due to significant flaws from overemphasizing artistic expression. Many players have pointed out issues with invisible walls and getting lost because of poor visual guidance. I didn't find getting lost a significant problem in my experience. After a few hours of adjusting to the invisible walls early in the game, I treated it like a last-generation game, considering the technical limitations of seamless exploration back then. As an experienced gamer, I could generally tell where I could go and where I couldn't.However, this doesn't mean the map design problems are trivial. The maps in Black Myth are too ""natural,"" prioritizing realistic visuals over clear navigation cues. This makes it hard for less experienced players to figure out where to go. Combined with random items and boss placements, this leads to a frustrating exploration experience. Item placement often feels almost random; if complete collection is your goal, this can be disastrous.The game's combat focuses mainly on boss battles but suffers from inconsistent pacing during exploration scenarios. The previously concentrated boss fights felt more balanced in my second playthrough with a different route in Chapter 2. Still, sometimes bosses appear too frequently or infrequently, disrupting player expectations and flow—though it's not a significant issue for everyone, some might find it bothersome.As a AAA game from the UE 5 generation, the graphics seem to be beyond criticism, but there are actually some significant issues. This part should probably be discussed in the performance section, but I didn't bother adjusting the order. The game's models are highly detailed thanks to UE 5's Nanite technology, but the vegetation still seems to have been created using traditional techniques. I could very clearly see the texture popping of vegetation; even though I played with LOD set to cinematic, the LOD for vegetation still had issues, which was very immersion-breaking. If this problem could be solved, the game's graphics could be considered the most realistic UE 5 game. But another, more severe problem is that the game has a lot of artifacts, especially temporal ones, which are particularly noticeable in particle effects. Similar issues can be observed with hair, character edges, and water surfaces, where much chaotic high-frequency information is visible. I'm unsure if this is noise or something else, but it makes these visuals very blurry.The combat system in the game is merely passable. Many bosses still don't interact well with players, not due to their difficulty but because players often can't deal damage for extended periods. Effectively damaging a boss largely depends on whether its AI decides to come within attack range (like Kang-Jin Loong). While specific strategies or playstyles can address this issue, the lack of a universal ranged attack option remains problematic.A more significant issue lies with the protagonist's combat mechanics. The design feels lacking; the three weapon stances only affect heavy attacks, leaving normal attacks monotonous. There's no blocking system—only dodging—which suggests developers want players to stay aggressive during boss fights. However, Black Myth's combat boils down to resource management: heavy attacks require light attacks to build up, and light attacks consume stamina. This approach conflicts with encouraging constant aggression, making the combat experience feel disjointed.Finally, after discussing the shortcomings above, let's revisit the aspects outside the game. I initially didn't want to talk about these, but the article needs a complete ending. As I mentioned at the beginning, I'm setting aside the controversies and discussions outside the game because the conversation gets distorted once you bring up things outside the game. I don't know when it started, but gamers have stopped simply discussing the game and begun to care more about things outside it. Many people’s evaluations of the game have become polarized as if the only ratings are 0/10. As I said in the title, Black Myth is over-hyped. Perhaps this type of marketing wasn't Game Science's original intention, but once the market sees the advantages of doing this, what will everything become in the end? Who knows?"
Positive,u either go monke or you go monke. must go monke

Positive,Very Very good.
Positive,Teach me how to be a good monkey!
Positive,Game of the year
Positive,"I just want to add my take on this game being called a ""SOULS-LIKE""If you like souls games, you'll probably like this.If you're looking for a souls-like game, you'll be disappointed.If you like action games with combos and want a challenge, you'll like this.This ISN'T a souls-like at all. This game plays more of a really hard Jedi Fallen Order and it's simplifying it a lot.A game being hard, having roll mechanics, limited heals and checkpoints where you rest to recover your heals and teleport DOESN'T MAKE A GAME A SOULS-LIKE, a souls-like is way more than that.The game is pretty good and I'm still in the beginning, don't let the 1st/2nd boss discourage you from the rest of the game, you can do this. Change tactics, respec builds, farm skill points."
Positive,"I have been following this game's development for many years. I was afraid it would not live up to my steep expecations, but I couldn't be more wrong. The combat feels great and the story is really interesting."
Positive,"Have only played for a few hours but it's great so far, make sure to update your game drivers especially if you're on older hardware. The only problem I had was performance which was solved with new drivers (NVIDIA 560.94). Not sure how performance is on AMD."
Positive,"Game of the year, if Warhammer 40k Space Marines 2 sucks."

Positive,"Amazing game and I had no performance issues For those having traversal stutter Use frame gen on high frame rate or motion blur for low frame rate , reduce shadow and global lumenation setting based on your GPU capability If you are not using frame gen lock your frame rate"
Positive,"This is such a well developed, well thought-out game. The main fights are brilliant and the fighting system itself is highly addictive. I've never seen so much in the talent trees that affect HOW you fight. And you can respec easily! Idk this game is just fun. It's one of the few that actually earn the full price - and I was happy to pay it.Edit 40 hours later - this is in the top 5 of all time. Incredible game. SO WELL DONE."

Positive,"Alert: it's more difficult than elden ringPros:Innovative combat system and exquisite enemies. No player-griefing ""features"" in some soul games. Smooth yet challengingCons: Graphic setting detection needs improvement. My graphic card (4090) crashed with auto-detected setting. Had to manually scale it down a bit and then it ran smoothly. Too many air walls on map. Devs need to work out a better solution."
Positive,"This is best ARPG game I've play in a long time, not only because the background story is amazing but also battle, stunning view are increadable as well. I wish there will be more company like game science to focus on game itself instead of political and stuff."

Positive,"The best game in my life, so proud of the culture content. Perfect light, texture and models."
Positive,Difficulty is harder than elden ring if you like a good challenge
Positive,i have to edit this review.if you want to know what stress is. play this game.the boss got a very tiny hitboxes for you to hit.and you got a veryyy big hitboxes for the boss to hit.
Positive,"Finished the story tonight. Overall it is an amazing game that does most things right. A few little annoyances like weirdly placed invisible walls and a few annoying areas.Bosses are for the most part the highlights of the game, most of them being very fun with enough challenge to feel rewarding. The final chapter was for the most part the weakest part of the game, dumping you in a massive zone with hardly anything in it just as an excuse to use the summersault cloud. The final section easily brings it back on top with an amazing finale."
Positive,"Hated the other Soulslikes because of death penalties in a game where you're supposed to constantly die. Not having that in penalty system here, I can finally enjoy one of these types of games.  It's gorgeous and has amazing combat.  I really love it so far."

Positive,"I beat the game, but chapter 4 has to be some of the most funless gaming I have ever seen. Immediately redeemed by the rest of the game. I recommend it but not to everyone, most people probably will quit halfway."
Positive,"Visuals are absolutely incredible.Performance is solid, game is well optimized.Atmosphere is God-Of-War level. Finally some fresh ideas and a new IP!Gameplay and combat are well rounded and easy to learn.Two hours in and my only complaint is the lack of a map, every other aspect is perfect."
Positive,"Journey to the West was a big part of my childhood like many other Chinese people's and with this, I have been following this game since its first reveal in 2020 and haven't been let down from my initial impressions. I applaud Game Science for their great work on this game and for bringing a piece of one the most well known Chinese literatures and mythologies to a wider audience through a video game. 齐天大圣回来了！"
Positive,"Gorgeous Visuals ✔Stunning enemy and character designs ✔Fast Paced and engaging combat ✔Enemy variety ✔Level up to unlock skills and no tedious RPG elements ✔PC optimisation ✔PLAY AS MONKE ✔✔✔The combat is smooth with precise dodging and positioning to avoid attacks (Dodging is a bit lenient so no need to sweat)It is NOT a souls like, there is no penalty for dying. The game seems all fun definitely give it a try.And most important - REJECT PROPAGANDA, RETURN TO MONKE"
Positive,"A love letter to Chinese mythology and media.Taking place post journey to the west, we take control of the destined one in this epic, deeply inspired take on the evergreen pillar of Eastern media. The passion the developers have oozes through every cut scene, design choice and piece of dialogue. Many of those who are familiar with the journey to the west and its many adaptations will revile in the attention to detail taken in crafting this master work. Even small things, such as the framing of a cut scenes to harken back to the Stephan Chow's adaptation, or the whole thing with the headless monk statue and the British museums inspiriting the story in chapter 2 only goes to show the care that's gone into crafting this amazing game. As someone who is vaguely familiar with these, I was only told about some of the soruces of inspiration and could not share the excitement that many Chinese fans of the game felt when seeing these nods and references. Though, I did share in the amazement at how much care has been put into this game. From a game play perspective, the game is comparable to a combination of God of War and Dark Souls, with how it can be difficult but a lot more forgiving than dark souls. You're not playing as Sun Wukong, but the destined one who's on a quest to collect Wukongs 6 relics. Thus the game play evolves as his journey progresses and you unlock spells and moves inspired by Wukongs many abilities. What makes it constantly fresh and engaging is that evolution and the variety of enemy designs both from a visual and mechanics perspective. I found the combat to be challenging with a few select bosses but generally not too difficult. The boss designs are so interesting that I found myself enjoying encountering them and filling out my journal. Each boss encounter had me also eager to see their journal entry art, an ancient Chinese style depiction of the boss you've defeated.While boss fights are the highlight of the game, this is not a boss rush game, and it has a lot of secrets to uncover and exploration. The level design is generally linear but still has many paths that branch off. The decision to not include a map is an interesting one, and one that will take some getting used to initially. While this may initially make  exploration daunting, the level design and checkpoint system elevate the need for one. Exploring in this game (especially in the early days of release) felt amazing given the uncharted waters we were all entering and the beautiful visuals of this game. The world is breath taking. Taking place in a mystical ancient environment dominated by nature. The graphical fidelity of this release and the style is gorgeous. I played on high settings on a mobile 3070 and yet I was blown away when I first launched the game. Over time, I got used to the visuals however I still found myself amazed at the level design, the palace in chapter where you fight the yin yang monk being a highlight for me.I don't have the context to really compare character writing to the source material, but the impression I'm getting from others is that it's spot on. Not uprising given the attention to detail the game displays in other areas. I really enjoyed the writing in this game. Scenes with Bajie are a real highlight. His dialogue is very enjoyable and fun, however endearing when it calls back to his journey to the west and his friend Wukong. The game also has tragic characters which it writes with respect. Chapters 2, 4 and 5 were rather emotional. Bajie has a big presence in the story of 4 and 5 (love life and old comrade). I appreciate how ch 5 and what happens to Ox and his family elaborates on why Bajie made the decision that's behind the story of chapter 4. Also 4th sisters side story :.(......The secret cutscenes you can unlock are amazingly animated, and beautifully add context to the story. I loved each one of them, but 4 ,5 and 6 were a highlight for me. 6 being the most epic while 5 was emotionally heavy. I loved the choice of stop motion animation in 2. damn.. 5 hit hard... Ox brooo :.(......My only real criticisms for this game are the fact that certain items require farming which was annoying. Though none are necessary and only for 100% completion. As well as the shift in level design in chapter 6. Chapter 6 takes more of an open zone design which makes sense with the introduction of the flying nimbus. This isn't too bad as the chapter does have points of interest to orient you, however the shift in level design will be initially jarring. I've seen many mention invisible walls as an issue however I didn't find them to be too annoying personally. btw.... he's monki, monkey no climb tree?? also, why is everyone bri'ish in eng dub, same with stellar blade???I called this game a love letter to Chinese myth and media primarily because of how you can actually feel the passion that the developers have for the source material in this game. I really want to emphasise this. China is a country that deeply loves it's mythology, still adapting stories such as Nezha (appears in cutscenes btw), white snake and ofc Wukong. Their telling of these tales live on to this day and are entrenched in many of their childhoods. I'm very happy to see this adaptations coming to the west, and hope that we can get more at this level of quality. The excitement Chinese fans have for this game and it's attention to detail is infectious. I love hearing about it from them and seeing the love and care they have for these tales. The game journal does help give you more context to understanding who and what characters or things are, but I can only imagine how amazing the feeling of seeing the stories you grew up on adapted in a high quality way that pays deep respect to the material your culture treasures. Now that I'm done with the story, I'll be watching ppl talk about the lore on youtube. Stellar blade dethroned as favourite game of 2024. Wukong new best game. Thank you game science :) (also thanks for reading my yap session)这个游戏没有多样性，简直就是对中国古典名著的侮辱。我买这个游戏就是为了告诉大家这一点，都去买《星刃》！"

Positive,"Amazing game, amazing visuals. 10/10"
Positive,"Sweet Baby Inc. didn't want me to buy this game, so I paid extra for the deluxe edition, just make those fu(c)kers pissed. And I'd pay more just to prove a point. Viva la DEI resistance."

Positive,Monke goes BONK!

Positive,goated monke china lore boss rush
Positive,"Combat system is heat, not a souls copycat at all. Epic game."
Positive,Any game company that rejects Sweet baby inc. And DEI Is a company that will get my  money.   Plain and simple as that.
Positive,"So far only 4hrs into the game, here's my opinions:Graphic design & Map design: EpicBoss Fight: Hard but fair, you can take a hit from the boss and still survive, unlike some game...Background Music: Epic as wellExtra: All the enemies and NPCs have detailed descriptions alongside with traditional artwork. These little details shows how much works the dev put into this game.GOTY IMO"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong offers stunning visuals and epic boss fights that keep players engaged. The magic system is impressive, adding depth to the gameplay. However, the story can feel a bit disjointed at times, and there are some persistent bugs. Despite these issues, the game provides an exciting journey through a beautifully crafted mythical world. 🐒✨"
Positive,"Great game so far! The opening battle is breathtaking.While it’s light on the souls-like elements, the combat is much faster-paced. Timed dodges and proper attack execution still matter, though.The graphics and production value are fantastic, with impressive sound, voice acting, etc. To my surprise, it’s running perfectly on my PC—no stuttering, FPS dips, or other issues so far.Highly recommend!"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is simply brilliant. The combat is so addictive and the world and bosses are some of the most fun out there ! If you are wondering how it will run on your PC, here something to help you by -Performance on RTX 3060 ti & RX 6700 XT - Performance on RTX 4070 Super and RX 7800 XT -"
Positive,Feels like a game thats made to be enjoyed. We need more of this.Combat is challenging yet fair. Only thing I have to not that its a game that pushes your PC to the limits by its gorgeous graphics.There is unfortunately one major con and its the use of invisible walls. There is no consistency with them and I continuesly walk into them.
Positive,MONKEEE 10 - SWEET BABY INC 0 !! Glory to Lord Hanuman!!
Positive,This was worth every second of the 4 years I waited
Positive,"Berry gud game, only souls like game comparable to from soft titles."
Positive,"The 4 years a promise, they made it, the GOTY not a single doubt"
Positive,"despite some annoying things like some of the shrines being so far apart didn't make sense. just more of an annoyance more than anything. and if you don't have it on your c drive, the audio gets laggy/stutters/. might be an optimization issue.but... ABSOLUTELY CINEMA. had to change it back to a positive."
Positive,"beautiful game. the game visual makes like realistic (it use unreal 5 engine so no wonder it is good). compare to games made AAA company, BMW has higher standard. the details, animation, and combat was so fluid. the combat is like soulslike (more like nioh 2) but it won't punish you when you died, the point stays with you. The game run stable on my pc, rtx 4060 and amd 5 3400G (old pc with new gpu). got stuttering just twice in my playthrough. I am still in the forest, walking on it feels like in the real forest."
Positive,"Game looks beautiful, so no... your mid pc will not run it on 120fps.Don't expect miracles. if you have (actual) good pc, you'll be fine.performance optimisation is like 8/10animations are sick, solid 8/10 Boss fights are amazing, 9.5/10 (there needs to be a boss rush mode)Edit: You don't lose your ""souls"" if you die, so it's a steady progress. (you unlock skills,character development but not in a form of ""str.vit.dex etc.."" it's more like tree paths that lets you hone out certain play styles. I think it's a refreshing way to do it away from what softfrom does.Edit: Story is good, I am well invested into it.Overall I think game is like a solid 8.5/10"
Positive,"Really enjoying the game is the perfect balance between not so hard, not so easy. But you'll encounter some bosses and every run you're gonna learn the patterns and weak points as the souls like. Even though, this is not a souls game, it's more like God Of War but better and fun.For people that haven't played an RPG action game, this is the one."
Positive,Loving the game Just a Masterpiece Nothing bad Only had one crash after 6h of playing with no issuesThe looks of this game is stunning few errors here and there but other then that No one can convince me other wise that this game isn't perfect.It's kinda souls-like at same time not but honestly doesn't matter i love itI'm loving the game the combat and look of it.Running everything on high on5 5600x306032GB 3200 ram2TB M.2Avg 140 Fps

Positive,Very promising. Really impressed with the tech and the gameplay

Positive,mmmmm monkey souls
Positive,Monke see Monke do Monke beat the shit out of you
Positive,This game is bananas. Looks crazy good and the game runs smooth. So far I'm enjoying it with no complaints.
Positive,"Very rarely does a game deliver on exactly what was promised. This game not only met the hype and expectations i had, but exceeded them. It's a complete breath of fresh air. An incredible title that I can't wait to 100% complete.Totally recommend if you have any interest in the game. Fully worth it and fully worth the hype.Game runs completely perfect and I have encountered no bugs at all. A perfectly optimised game that excels on everything!"
Positive,"Game Of The Year for action games.  This is the best game I played in 2024 so far.This game has the vibe of the God of War but not the Elder Ring for It does not feel like a soul-like game.It is easy to get hands on but takes time to master.Gameplay is enjoyable. Great music, epic cinematic."
Positive,Nice battle performance
Positive,So far the game is better than I expected. It's surprisingly responsive and the performance is decent. Recommended
Positive,"I strongly recommend returning to monke,"
Positive,Such an amazing game. Totally worth the wait (3 years and change!)
Positive,peak monkey11 out of 10 visualsstory makes me feel like i am 2 seasons behind on an anime.
Positive,"Beautiful visuals, great gameplay, and a good entry point for the journey to the west lore! I’m only an hour or so into the game and am loving it!"
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong has stunning visuals, the combat and game play is fluid as it can be. Playing 4k using 3080 with no issue at all. This game is my game of the year already. we need more games like this with no BS."
Positive,"So far, I love the combat, the Chinese dialogue, the scenery, and most importantly, Sun WuKong."
Positive,"Monke go monke and then there's more monke and he go smash. In all seriousness, this game is a truly next gen game visually. It's a nice mix of souls-like and traditional RPG mechanics that I hope gamers don't flame it for, and remember that not every game needs to be a copy-paste of a Fromsoft game to be good."
Positive,"I'm playing in 4K using RTX 3070. I had thought my card couldn't handle the game initially, but after turning off RT, it actually ran very smooth. One of the most visually stunning games I've played. After one hour in, I haven't encountered any crashes or glitches. Great job Game Science. The game definitely has potential for GOTY.EDIT: After 8 hours in, I'm even more blown away by how good it is. The gameplay is top notch, the enemies are well designed, and the combat is insane. The only downside I find is in some of the level design, especially the invisible walls which I feel could have been replaced with other types of terrain. Other than that, this game is highly addicting and the graphics just blows everything away."
Positive,crazy how AAA multi billionaire companies like blizzard or ubisoft recently can’t come up with a single decent game but then a random chinese company comes up with this masterpiece
Positive,People just want a good game. You can see by the 1M concurrent at launch night. Good for them.
Positive,i can be cool monkey with staff

Positive,"Last year a studio out of nowhere showed what a team of passionate devs and artists can do and win hearts This year Game Science has absolutely done the same and cooked. 9/10 game for me, absolutely a masterpiece genre bend for hack n slash and souls type.-1 points for the camera that betrays me more than often, its fixable."
Positive,Finished all bosses + secret bosses/areas + all side/hidden quests. This game is 11/10 for me and for sure the goty.Erlang was my favourite boss to fight in the entire game and is such an unique boss fight. New game + here i come!
Positive,"This is the first time i write about a game on steam, i had to after experiencing such a masterpiece which is Black Myth Wukong, this is game of the year no question, the amount of content this game has to offer is stunning with such a high quality, i never heard about Wukong before the game and i loved the story and the lore , i m  a huge souls fan and played all the souls games, this game is up there with the best with beautiful graphics and fluid combat, if u like this genre just buy this game and get lost in its world , its a must play!! cant wait for the DLC."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is nothing short of a visual masterpiece. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking, immersing you in a world that feels both mythical and grounded in reality. Every frame looks like a painting, and the attention to detail in the environments, character models, and animations is truly a labour of love.The boss battles are a highlight, offering a perfect blend of challenge and strategy. Each boss feels unique, and their moves are designed in a way that makes them not just beatable but outplayable. It’s incredibly satisfying to learn their patterns and exploit their weaknesses, making every victory feel earned.My only suggestion is that it would be nice for the chapters to be better connected, it's too much of a transition from the previous chapter without any context, and it lacks the ""how did we got here"" because it's frequent to feel a bit random.What really stands out is the sheer amount of care that has gone into crafting this game. From the fluid combat to the nice UI and interesting characters, Black Myth: Wukong excels in so many areas that it leaves you constantly wishing for more. It’s the kind of game that will become one of those games that you'll remember in fondness, like a true classic. And it’s clear that the developers have poured their hearts into making it. We’re in for something truly special."

Positive,"I absolutely love this game. the graphics are amazing. The game play is clean and the story is unique and fun. Don't get me started on the amazing artwork. Bosses start a little difficult but if you play enough they easy to understand. I have Unlocked all achievements, and the secret stance. Let me tell you. Play this game all the way through. investigate everything because its all worth it. This game definitely deserves to be Game of the Year! 5 star rating! 100 out of 10"
Positive,"The mechanics and graphics are all great. I love this game. However, I want to notify the devs on one particular thing. THE EYES DON'T ANIMATE and they look lifeless. It's like the game is at 99.9 and it just needs that 0.1% to be perfect. Why don't the eyes animate?? It makes the characters look so lifeless."
Positive,"From the start of the game it had me loving the art direction, action, and the characters. Everything is done so well! There is never the boring moment normal ARPG's have of falling asleep while traversing. I was always excited to see what new challenged and enemies were waiting around the corner. The difficulty took some adjusting to, but once you get a hang of the combat system its much easier. It revolves mostly around dodging, but there are counters in the game too. The endgame is there! It reminds me of Remnant from the Ashes, when you finish it you want to go back and get all the things you missed. It could be secret areas, bosses, items, or even some journal entries. This game has done it all really well! The only ""open world"" is the final chapter which is chapter 6. And that requires some free roaming to further continue the story, I high recommend it. Do not compare to Elden Ring because it is entirely different. I would highly recommend!"
Positive,"Monkey guy is cool. 10/10For me this was a pleasant surprise because I was not hyped for this at all and I bought it on a whim, but this might be the most beautiful game I've played this year and the combat is actually fun. Just in case anyone was wondering (like me) this is about as close to a souls like as Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order is. Something else I didn't know is the story is Journey to the west, which I know nothing about but is apparently very close to the novel. This is all around a big surprise hit, to me anyway. If you relate to any of this then I would say just go ahead and pick it up, you might be pleasantly surprised as well."
Positive,"Finally, a game that truly resonates with our preferences! They were right to refuse collaboration with ""SWEET BABY INC,"" despite various threats of censorship from that entity. This game honors the story of the Monkey King in its entirety. What stands out is the complete absence of the wokeness that often taints the gaming landscape. I purchased the Deluxe version without hesitation. This game also remains untouched by the pressures of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion); it is quite rare in today's world to find a game devoid of politicization. Despite numerous Western journalists assigning it low scores due to their own corruption (if you seek hidden vices, follow the money), the sales figures tell a different story—numbers do not lie. Nowadays, I notice that to find a truly excellent game with challenging content and graphics worthy of the Unreal Engine 5, one must look towards the Asian market. For my part, I consider it the best game of 2024; it truly deserves its throne.""Caution: This is meant in a humorous tone despite the emphasis on freedom of expression."""
Positive,"Sick game, just wish my specs were better. It has the challenge of a souls game but with much less punishment from death, you can also respec for free whenever you want (which is fucking great)."
Positive,"100% Completion Review:First of all, wow the developers have really done something here. As a gamer who stopped playing for a long time to focus of life, work and studies coming back to this game was the best choice I ever made. I have never felt so hooked on a game since Witcher 3 or the first God of War. This game is definitely up there and the story itself is top class - set after the Journey to the West.Pros:- Fighting mechanics, ability to choose from 3 (secret 4th) style against bosses. If one doesn't work out then the other one surely will especially taking consideration of the sizes of bosses. It's fun to try them all.- Story, amazing story telling, the background of characters were explained, the animations and art 10/10 really puts you in that world and gets you hooked. They said there was no representation in the game, there was so many! These critics are liars.- Bosses, all with there unique abilities and styles, gets you learning all of their moves and finally beating them feels like a great achievement. The build up to final bosses is amazing and you get better as you go. Secret bosses/quests also are very good and rewarding - personally enjoyed the Loong storyline and that staff that gives you dragon lighting powers? world class. - Game itself looks beautiful, all types of terrains/weather/seasons. I ran this on my 3070 and was averaging about 70-80 fps sometimes 90. I would say in the water this went down below 30 fps (chapter 3 in the cave). Overall beautiful scenery, character designs, armour, weapons etc...Cons:- RNG aspect. Having to kill enemies for drops can be a pain and annoying but do able (if you have time and want to grind).- Again, RNG, especially with getting the Seed to Sow achievement - you will find yourself having all the seeds except 1 and will have to wait 30 minutes for each re spawn. This was the only thing that frustrated me personally. Overall: 10/10, I really hope they make it into a sequel since it is set after the Journey to the West. Although the story concludes we are still yet to see how us the new Wukong story will be."

Positive,"An absolutely amazing game 9.5/10. The combat was spectacular with many different builds and fighting styles you can choose.Amazing story telling and graphicsWhile not a souls-like game it was a very enjoyable rogue-like rpg adventure game that has some challenge for a majority of players but for experienced souls-like players would be easy, but a new scenery for combat. the only reason i put 9.5/10 instead of 10/10 is because I only had a few issues with this game, the camera in combat could definitely use some work because it was making some situations unfair or rage-inducing. The only other issue I have(which is not really an issue) is just that the game does not have much replayability in my eyes because in your run you try every single combat style and the only thing you may be able to do is switch which stat you may want to focus in."
Positive,"An extremely high quality game compared to the AAA landscape around us, i encountered almost no bugs, and no game breaking bugs. Bosses were fun, with a few exceptions, but every game has that, and the combat system actually allows for duo bosses to feel fair (eat your hearts out godskin duo), yes there are some difficult fights, but they felt fair instead of just 1 shotting you because you dared to get hit once. most of this is probably due to the combat system not hinging everything on perfect stamina management. so yea, highly recommend anyone to grab it, it was worth full price too."
Positive,"You start as a peach and then become the great sage, GOTY 2024"
Positive,solid game with cool boss fights and great combat system and gameplay that is hindered by awful exploration
Positive,good game :)

Positive,"Stunning visuals, touching story, fun action systems. Look, this game is far from perfect - there are a few aspects that could been a lot better, but this game excels sooooo much in a few aspects that make it nevertheless a 10 out of 10."

Positive,"GoW 2018 and Dark Souls had a love child, need I say more?"
Positive,Good thing this game is lacking in inclusivity and diversity.
Positive,nioh but chinese (its very fricking good)
Positive,"7/10. Enjoyable, but the story is nonsense, and overall, the main character is super boring. The game becomes repetitive toward the end. None of the characters that appear mean anything, as they only stay for about 5 minutes max, except for the boarchapter ratings:2 > 4 > 3 > 1 > 5 > 6clearly on chapter 5/6 their budget run out"
Positive,"I really, really enjoyed my time with this game. Its an experience from start to finish and il never be able to forget it. The Great and Excellent:Obviously this game looks absurdly good. The graphics are insane. Sometimes good graphics take away from the art design. Thankfully this is not the case. There are tons and tons of different biomes and climates that make the game ever changing in art style. Environments have so much culture and creativity in them that its hard to not find them beautiful.There are special cut scenes that occur after every chapter. These are fucking fantastic. Tons of different animation styles and it was a great breath of fresh air from the games style. Which makes them all that more special. They never needed to go this far, but they did, and it really pays off.  I really enjoyed the stories that it told, especially when it related back to the story in the game. Music in these animations are also fantastic. I really enjoyed the combat in this game. Its basically a mix of Sekiro and GoW Ragnarok. There is only one weapon like Sekiro and a hp pot but you have tons and tons of RPG mechanics like GoW, like Spells, Armor, Weapons skins, Consumables, and a massive skill tree. There is honestly so much of this that you could create so many unique builds from the stuff you get. But if you dont like your build you can respec at any time with no cost. The combat itself has a ton of impact to it. Animations are incredibly fluid. Movement feels fantastic and works really well with the enemies that you face. The spells are great and there are tons and tons of customization to them. I honestly just love the Bo Staff as a weapon and it feels so damn cool to use it. Boss battles are amazing. The difficulty of them is probably spilt between 70% 1 to 3 tries, 20% 10-20 tries and 10% 30+ tries. I think thats a good difficulty range and the game's boss difficulty never got too spicy for me. The end bosses are some of the best bosses ive ever faced in video games. But most of the bosses in the game are great because of the visuals and the combat all meshing together to really shine. The mythos in this game is really solid. The narrative and worlds in this game is created with such love and devotion to Journey to the West. It reminded me alot of experiencing the gods in GoW remake and the trilogy. Just seeing gods and characters that you know from the world, in all of their glory and fighting them is just really fucking cool. You play Black Myth Wukong for the combat, but you continue to stay playing because of the mythos. Overworld gameplay is pretty good. There are a good amount of secrets and areas that have tons of optional content. Exploration is really rewarding with stuff for your character, as well as fun little stories that add to the worldbuilding. Mobs are not as frustrating as something like Elden Ring, but they do put up a good challenge. Meh:The voice acting ranges from great at points to awful. This is probably because of voice direction and because of them being a studio from China. Its pretty hard to translate Chinese to English especially when it comes to dialogue. So im not placing the blame on the actors but rather on the difficult translation. Still, theres a lot of good performances. But the bad ones stick out. Writing is also something that has is tricky to evaluate. Cause of the translation issues. The game suffers from being weird at points because the dialogue doesnot do a good job of setting things up. So it makes some scenes feel really out of the blue and random, when they shouldn't be. This extends to the overall world, i dont think they do a good job at explaining the world of Journey to the West. Before this game i knew about 30% of things from Journey to the West. Mostly from Smite and lore segments online. Even with this knowledge i struggled at times to understand the world and what was going on. I cant imagine how hard it must be for someone who is a complete noob, to immerse themselves in the story. Its not all bad, they do give you tons and tons of lore to read in the menu, as well as really well crafted lore segments after chapters. But for the most part this is the weakest part of the games storyline. While the game looks great, theres a big disconnect with one part of the graphics. That would be the Women. Women in this game look so clean, its just really immersion breaking. They legit all look like anime girls that its really hard to take some of the scenes seriously with them. The mature women look good but thats the minority sadly. I really enjoy the transformations in the game. But there are so many of them that i feel guilty for not swapping. I wish there was just a smaller amount with more interesting stuff added to them rather than the quantity of transformations that we got. There are a good amount of legacy dungeons. Massive areas that span chapters. I do like a good amount of them. But i feel like some of them are way too large and therefore are a bit of a determent to the pacing of the game.  The Bad:Performance is really awful at points, definitely more to do with my busted PC. It was mostly with loading things in, i.e. start fighting a boss and it has massive frame drops for about 15 seconds. After those 15 the game would run fine. Same thing would occur in the overworld during big scenery changes. Still i was able to run it on high at a solid 50 fps for most of the runtime. The main character is designed to be a blank slate. I dont really have issues with these characters when its a FPS game. But because its a third person game, your character just doesnot talk and has a deadpan stare in basically every scene. Making some of the scenes where he should have a reaction very very immersion breaking. Honestly i think they should have just made him a little more emotive or just made him mute instead of having no emotion at all. Here are the slightly annoying things. No overworld maps are in the game. This makes some parts of exploration really annoying. There are invisible walls across the game. It makes traversal annoying. There are consistant imput issues with the controller, especially for special moves. This can be annoying as fuck for boss fights, but it wasn't enough to ruin the combat for me. Honestly, this might be one of the best games I've ever played. Sure, this is no where close to some of the best games ever made. But the highs that this game gets too are so fucking high, that i think its impossible for me not to say this is one of the best experience's I've ever had in games."
Positive,Damn. Peta approves!
Positive,"Someone told me this not SOUL game , why i die 20 times on that big head freak .AMAZING"
Positive,monke good. sweet baby eviledit: 30 hours in and its even better now.edit: 120 hours in and even better than last time
Positive,"5 hours in game feels fun it's not too hard nor too easy, graphics are great and plenty of enemy variety.After 15 hours of playing I am very impressed with the game and how much it opens up.I started with a very simple move-set and mostly attack and dodging the bosses, but the further you go the more you get to customize your monkey by choosing your own way on how you spend your SP, your Mind Cores, which curious/talismans/summons/armor sets and spells you want to use.Some bosses are more vulnerable to certain spells others even lock your spells and resist skills in which you can use a special spell that locks all your spells but improves your damage.Additionally the exploration and secret areas/bosses are quite alright."
Positive,"""Journey to the West"" is based on the story of Xuanzang in history, and after a long period of folk circulation, it was finally created by literati writers. It is based on the folk stories of Tang monks learning scriptures and related scripts and miscellaneous dramas, and is recreated. It is a magnificent, structurally complete tome. The work is rich in imagination, plot twists, vivid and witty language, and has a unique style.One hundred times in the book, the first seven chapters write about the birth of Sun Wukong, seeking the Tao, breaking into the Dragon Palace, disturbing the Hades, and making trouble in the Heavenly Palace, showing the spirit of loving freedom and daring to resist; Eight to thirteen times to write such as the law, Guanyin visiting monks, Wei Zheng slaying the dragon, Taizong into the underworld, Liu Quanjin melon and Xuanzang to learn scriptures, explain the origin of the scriptures, and play a role in organizing the plot; The fourteenth to the hundredth chapters are taken from the text of the scriptures, and the Monkey King and others have gone through hardships, showing a tenacious fighting spirit and an optimistic character. The work is adept at depicting mythological characters, blending socialized personalities, supernatural divinity and certain animal characteristics to present a colorful fantasy world in a logical way."
Positive,this game is really fun im glad that it has its challenges and that you get a good story experience
Positive,"Not a souls game, but very satisfying combat and bossess"
Positive,"ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE.After 170 hours I still feel like this review is premature. I wanted to wait til I finished a couple new games plus runs, before writing a review. But after finishing one complete play through I felt compelled to write my review. This game is ABSOLUTE cinema. It is a pure Master Piece. In my humble opinion there are no other contenders for Game of the Year in 2024. Any GOTY nomination which leaves this game out is invalid. Wukong as a studio first release was impressive on it's own, for combat, story telling, cinematics, sound track. There are several triple AAA studios that don't even come close to the level of quality, artistic design and passion put into telling this games story. Boss design is so good and the game always gives a way to figure the fights out.This game not being fully open world is a complaint I heard alot and believe me when I say it takes nothing away from this game. I can't wait to see what Game Science does next.NB: Game can be demanding to run even on an RTX 4090.For the best optimization guide use Hardware Unbox guide, linked below:Update: Finished NG+2 unlocked all abilities and all journal entries. NG+3 seems to be where you start to see boss difficulty increase.  I like that the you have to play NG+ to unlocked the additional relic levels.

Positive,Death to DEI / Woke阿弥陀佛。。。
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is an absolutely stunning game, unlike anything I’ve experienced before. The graphics are nothing short of breathtaking, especially when playing with an RTX 4090. Every scene feels like a masterpiece, with the game pushing the limits of what’s visually possible. The level of detail and realism achieved is simply incredible, making it a feast for the eyes in every way.Performance-wise, while the game is often recommended for controllers, I found playing with a mouse and keyboard to be smooth and highly enjoyable. On an RTX 4080 Super, running at a resolution of 3440x1440, I consistently achieved a frame rate between 60-80 fps with graphics set to ‘Cinematic’—the highest setting available—and Ray Tracing set to High. The game runs flawlessly without any crashes or performance issues, delivering a butter-smooth experience.The story in Black Myth: Wukong is deeply engaging, especially for those familiar with the classic tale “Journey to the West.” The narrative is beautifully crafted, combining ancient Chinese mythology with modern storytelling techniques to create a captivating experience.The gameplay mechanics are also top-notch. The combat feels incredibly responsive and realistic, making each encounter feel intense and satisfying. The character and enemy designs are detailed and diverse, offering a variety of challenges that keep the gameplay fresh and exciting.In conclusion, I can confidently say that Black Myth: Wukong is the best game of the year, and a strong contender for Game of the Year. It’s not just a visual spectacle; it’s a complete package with a compelling story and innovative gameplay that set a new standard in gaming.Rating: 10/10"
Positive,"Me see Black Myth: Wukong trailer, know it special. Monke play, feel power. Game big, game deep, like jungle full of secrets. Monke fight, use staff, staff long, staff strong. Staff crush enemy, monke feel good. Enemy tough, enemy big, but monke quick, monke smart. Monke dodge, monke hit hard.Game look pretty, like jungle after rain. Monke see water, see tree, see sky. All look real, make monke feel inside world. Music good too, make monke heart beat fast, like when hunt.Monke story strong, about other monke, Wukong. Wukong smart, Wukong tricky, like monke. Monke learn from Wukong, get new power, new move. Monke feel like hero, like legend. Monke fight many enemies, big and small. Some scary, but monke brave.Monke think game make feel alive, make feel proud. This game not just good, this game special. Special like art. When monke play, monke see beauty. World in game look like painting, like dream. Black Myth: Wukong make monke feel like king of jungle. Monke recommend to all monke, all human too."
Positive,"My gosh, oh gosh. This game is so good. I would have made it look way better if I had better specs and ray tracing. The game still looks amazing. The combat feels so good to use, the bosses are way harder than they look once you fight them, but some aren't that intimidating. You have to look out for their movements and their attack pattern and plan how you will counter accordingly. Don't even get me started on the music. Everything about this game from the art to the culture. I want to say thank you, Game Science. Thanks for making this game with one of my favourite mythology stories. Sun Wukong is my favourite character and basing the game after the novel was brilliant. Thank you for this much-anticipated game."
Positive,See monkey.Purchase monkey.Be monkey.Monkey.
Positive,Game of the year.
Positive,"Peak music, peak gameplay, peak protagonist"
Positive,i love china
Positive,One of the best games ever played!!!
Positive,"Game has Monke, Man sees Monke, Man is happy."
Positive,"This game is a Masterpiece from the start. the fact that a mobile game company had made a game this good says a lot. From the areas, to the combat, the music, the bosses, the weapons and armor, the STORY. it literally has it all. I don't achievement hunt at all, but because this game was so good, i had to get em all and let me tell you it was worth every second. Would most definitely recommend 10/10. This game is definitely game of the year worthy for sure."
Positive,"After completing ""Black Myth: Wukong"" and achieving 100% completion, I can confidently say this game is a masterpiece. From the stunning visuals to the intricate world-building, every aspect immerses you in a vibrant story rich world.Graphics: The art direction is phenomenal. Each environment is beautifully crafted, from lush forests to intricate temples, making exploration immersive and great to experience.Audio: The ambiance of the sound and the music was captavating and enhanced the feeling of the game and narrative.Engaging Combat: The combat system is fluid and rewarding, allowing for a variety of playstyles. The different abilities and transformations keep battles fresh and exciting.Rich Storytelling: The narrative does an excellent job of captivating you in the world, weaving traditional mythology with modern themes. The character development, especially of the ''Destined One'' learning about Wukongs past, is compelling and adds depth to the experience.Challenging Achievements: Completing all achievements felt rewarding without being overly tedious. They encouraged exploration and mastery of the game mechanics.Occasional Pacing Issues: Some story segments and chapters felt a bit stretched, but they didn’t detract significantly from the overall experience.Exploration: Some of the exploration in the game was fun and engaging, but the flaw is that it was confusing to know where you were, where to go and what to do sometimes when it felt like you could seemingly walk anywhere, but it was blocked by an invincible wall or ledge that was somehow too tall to jump, or there were seemingly random paths that lead to nowhere. And there is not much to guide you unless you happen to know where to go.RNG drops: The RNG in the game felt occasionally unnecessary. While true some RNG is good for a game, the amount of it from enemy drops to plants felt at times discouraging.In conclusion, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a must-play for anyone who enjoys Action RPGs or is interested in Rich Storytelling. The developers have truly outdone themselves, and I can’t wait to see what they create next. Highly recommended!"
Positive,"Even if the rest of the game was trash I would've still recommended it for the graphics alone! CINEMA! A spectacle! Although demanding of your graphics card it is well worth the money spent. Its almost like you can finally enjoy and get your money's worth. Very well designed fighting mechanics, boss fights are well adjusted so the player does not feel the need to get extra strong for a certain encounter. Also the ''talent tree and stats'' are quite unique and refreshing which really boosts the game even more. Not only the story is amazing it shows a lot of care and patience in how it was told throughout the game (assuming it will be similar later on). 6 hours in and just finished chapter 1, I gotta say if the other 5 chapters are of similar quality, personally game of the year 2024 should go to Black Myth: Wukong!! Banging job!!!!"

Positive,"This game exceeded my expectation and lived up to the hype, i enjoyed everything about it, the bosses where so much fun and unique with cool encounters. I will say that some of the level design seemed lazy and their was just to many invisible walls, but it wast something game breaking, aside from that everything else about the game was amazing with the story being really good and easy to follow."
Positive,"Сама игра конечно 10 из 10!Сюжет прямолинейный, с множеством отсылок на мифологию.Билдование отдельное почтение.Собирай что хочешь, играй чем хочешь, разные шмотки с бафами, оружие с бафами, улучшенные скилы, пасивки, бусинки, мобы пожранные.Бос файты клевые и если не учитывать бладборщину то интересные и со своими механиками и темпом. Но есть прям лютые ёбари которым ты сносишь 1% хп раз в минуту (в окно) а они тебе по 10 ударов в секунду по 50-60% хп.Секретки тоже интересные со своим мини сюжетом.Относительно самого геймплея, то он похож на ритм игру, где ты должен словить тот самый ритм битвы с боссом так как файт заточен на ударил, уклонился, ударил тем самым не прерывая комбо.И когда ты заучиваешь боссов то прям приятно легко и плавно проходит бой и очень даже красиво я б сказал.Из доебов конечно растянутые опен ворлды с секретками которые заебешся вылизывать на пустых просторах.Особенно улыбнула 6 глава где тебе дают возможность исследовать огромную локацию специальным образом и боссы опциональные которых сука найди в огрооооомной локе.В общем рекомендую очень любителям сослайков или просто слешеров."

Positive,"Great story! Beautiful graphic and animation. You are not penalized for dying, and you can freely test out different builds/stance. You can make your chapter boss fight easier by doing secret quest and get item/spell from said quest. Highly recommend (if your PC could run it)!"
Positive,"oooh near perfect gametheres allot thats good with the gamebut also allot thats just not greatlets start of with the pros- great combat, great design, nice story ( if you know about journey to the west)- the sound design the upgrade system , tonnes of contentand i can list allot more thats right with the game but i really dont want tobecause what it does wrong i rather jump intoim not gonna say it's GOTY because it doesnt deserve that. it's near perfect but there where some thing that where so awfull i dont want to Cons- some bosses are jokes and some are incredibly hard for no dicernable reason- allot of it's systems work against you, you get an immobilize spell early on but it's by far the worst spellmeanwhile the moon roam transform you get is one of the best in the game. - the hitboxes need some serious work, i swear i missed most of my attacks vs the yellow wind sage. other then him being Hyperactive son of a gun, he was also just like NAH you didnt hit me when i clearly did ( and he wasnt in his spirit form)- THERE is NO MAP, in a game like this THATS criminal, i would say yeah its fine if the areas dont feel like a maze and blend over allot like snow lvl in chapter3 i got lost SO many times because no sense of where i went or where i was before. - the equipment system for weapons is weird , you craft weapons and some of them have tiers but you dont keep the unlocked weapon in the previous tier you gotta RE-craft it. WHAT is that.- the final boss normal and true ending is the WORST designed boss in the entire game, i am so tired of boss steals MCs powers trope. this heavily deducted allot of the points i was gonna give because if they dont care about making a nice ending why should i.8.5/10Verdict:  near perfect game with some GLARING issues . hope they can either fix that with patches or take from this for the next game they make"
Positive,great game 61 hr in
Positive,"yes! really really good game. amazing story, amazing bosses, amazing game"
Positive,"Beautiful game about Chinese mythology. Amazing game play, mechanics, Boss designs, and story telling. This game is challenging but in a greatest way possible. Contender for the game of the year in my books."
Positive,2024 GAME OF THE YEAR. The pinnacle of modern gaming has arrived.
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong is everything I have been looking for since The Witcher 3. It has a great story that you can learn more about from media outside the game. The game is polished. The combat is smooth, the visuals are stunning, the bosses are diverse and challenging just enough but never frustrating (I consider myself as an average gamer). The cutscenes... well... you won't find any better. The NG+ is not just a carbon copy of the first playthrough with more HP and dmg but has new items to find. I have no negative point to make about the game. Not even when I try really hard to criticize it. It's a piece of art, it's an experience, it's simply more than a game. I highly recommend this game."
Positive,"What a wonderful game......no micro transactions, no politics or pushing insane agendas.....its not in alpha, no game pass bs.....just a great game...."
Positive,"story and game play are good but sometime my PC can't handle it, and other times works very well just don't forget to open the game with compatibility option .. otherwise very good game and addictive"
Positive,You play as a monkey that can jump and hit people with a stick.
Positive,"I haven't been this immersed into a single player story game in such a very long time. The bosses weren't impossible, but just impossible enough for you to keep trying and have to be intentional with your build. With Chinese Mythology so new to me personally, this game made me so invested, as it is very original."
Positive,very good binchi ling
Positive,10/10 the only thing that would've made the game better is if the MC was replaced by a Black lesbian transgender who suffers from social anxiety
Positive,"Watched this game like a hawk for 3 years before it came out, praying that it wouldn't be another UE5 scam game. It is not. Combat, progression, narrative, and visuals are all insane. GG Game Science."

Positive,gotta give this a positive review for not having lgbtq+
Positive,Great action game.
Positive,"A great take on the Journey to the West in a reasonably simple ""souls style"" game. The cinematics are absolutely beautiful and would play this over and over again. The only time consuming part are the random drops you get from picking plants like seeds or certain equipment as the plants only respawn every 30 minutes."
Positive,Never stop oonga boonga.
Positive,HOLY FUCK MONKEY
Positive,"legit gonna be goty, goated ahh game frfr"
Positive,"I am almost at 3/4 of it and this game is fucking awesome in basically every aspect. 🟢Pros:-Graphics is obviously what made this game so famous and omg, its so beautiful. The devs know that and will make sure you see it every time you meditate.-Gameplay is really focused on combat and exploration, combat us fun and diverse and to explore all those beautiful biomes and places is really nice.-Combat is diverse and fun. The game is basically a boss rush, with over 80 bosses to defeat. Majority of them have incredible fights in which you can use different postures, spells and transformations.-The cultural displays are really cool to see during the story and while you explore the map.-The NPCS are really well made, with really good face motion and personalities. The tiny angry pig is the GOAT imo.🔴Cons:-Not lots of cons but the amount of invisible walls is unholly, even after chapter 1, where they open the map a lot, they are everywhere and its frustrating to see what appear to be a path and just bump into an invisible wall-The game has some performance issues, I personally didnt have anything that I cared that much until now, but Chapter 3 omfg, i understand that snow is shit to render but common.9.5/10, one of the few games i did not regret getting full price. Beautiful, fun af, cool af, interesting lore and characters and ofc monkey. Cant wait for the next two games the studio is planning to launch."
Positive,best game ever
Positive,Hearing the Non-White Mini Boss Fight Battle OST makes this game MORE WORTHY of being GAME OF THE YEAR. Hands Down!
Positive,This is a videogame. An actual video game. And its fun.You want to play all day. The game is fun. You want to play for a bit before handling family duties. The game is fun. It makes me feel rewarded for playing it and not a sense of seasonal FOMO.

Beautiifull audio-visual with breathtaking sceneries. Almost perfect game-mechanics and gameplay. Surprise of the year. Sucess well deserved."
Positive,"Antes de jugarlo, mirate un videito que te cuente la historia de Wukong antes para entender mejor. El juego arranca después de los relatos de Wukong.Es excelente, buena jugabilidad aunque sin tanta variedad, buena ambientación, buena historia y buenos gráficos. Aunque estos podrían estar pulidos un poquito más en optimización.Dicen que no tiene inclusividad pero el prota es un mono. Para pensar."
Positive,"Monkey see, Monkey kill"
Positive,"This game is absolutely i wanted since first trailer years ago, overall wukong is the best game on 2024.Story 10/10Graphics 10/10Music 10/10Character 10/10Hope this game won GOTY on 2024"
Positive,10monkey out of monkeys
Positive,Are you a monkey? No? Wanna be one? Yes? Then play this game!
Positive,"biggest surprise hit of the year. did not expect to be so impressed with this game, but its one of the best games i've played in years"
Positive,"An addictive experience. Die to bosses, grind for XP,  Eliminate bosses, repeat."
Positive,"For a first major banger IP from Game Science, this is impressive.This game has the most creative boss designs I've ever seen in any game. Each boss is unique. The movesets they have, the animations, the chaos, the scale. All amazing.Story is ""probably"" really good, but I know nothing about Chinese Mythology so I was lost. Voice acting is good though, even with those translations.Music/Score is incredible. Played the game on my 7.1 system, and my house was shaking! I felt completely immersed. The animated cut scenes between each chapter was VERY well done.Performance is as expected for how gorgeous this game looks. It runs on UE5, and with RT on, mad frames are taxed. Overall the game ran fine at 4K Cinematic settings (4090, 12900K, 64GB RAM). Average FPS was around 90. Dips varied depending on the environment I was in & the types of bosses I fought.Gameplay is good but could use some work. The combo's you can pull off are kind of shallow especially when switching between all stances. I appreciate the transformations/spirits amongst other skills, however even finishing the game thoroughly, I was still required to grind HEAVY to acquire enough skill points to unlock most of the important skills/perks. I ended up not using some of the spells you unlock in the later game because.. well... IMMOBILIZE. The invisible walls are extremely annoying.10 million copies sold in 3 days? Yeah the sequel about to spank.- Gameplay 8/10- Story 7/10- Acting 7/10- Music/Score 10/10- Graphics 10/10- Performance 8/10- Bosses 10/10Overall 8/10"
Positive,you get a big sloppy dildo as a weapon and u are monke trying to find strong monke 10/10
Positive,"we are at the peak of gaming achievements, ladies and gents.im calling it right now: this game will totally OWN all the gaming awards available this year and whichever doesn't. then you know its rigged."
Positive,"Reject Modernity, Return To Monke."
Positive,"it's like a dream coming true,very nice"
Positive,Game goodMonke together strongGame journalists weak
Positive,"Great game, really enjoyed my playing this game a lot"
Positive,"Was too good to be true in 2020, is too good to be true now but it also happens to exist"
Positive,abosultely masterpice. GAME OF THE YEAR !!!
Positive,"Do you need a break from the woke nightmare, and dream a dream worth dreaming? This is a game, that understands what it is, what we want, and delivers it with love. Game of the year for me. I'm 48 hours in, and still motivated to explore every nook and cranny. I highly recommend Black Myth Wukong."
Positive,Monkey absolutely kicks ass. One of the greatest action RPGs ever made. Make sure you have a PC powerful enough to run this game well otherwise the game may not actually be worth it for you. This is very possibly the most technically demanding game that exists right now.
Positive,game of the year for sure
Positive,"Sun Wukong, no longer in his prime,Goes on an adventure, to make us lose track of time.On his nimbus cloud, he travels fast,To happily proclaim, ""This game's a blast!"".With the right amount, of systems in place,Crafting, skill trees and even sites of grace.Has blissful combat, with wonderful bosses,Just never give up, despite your losses.Some minor polish, might be lacking,Invisible walls and a camera, that isn't always tracking.Some buggy textures and traversal movement,Is really something, that could use improvement.And some monkey-business, shows its ugly head,With performance issues, that many will dread.Frame rates often drop, and so does my frown,But it's easily fixed, with some settings brought down.At 50 pounds, this game was bought,And for 20 hours, I have already fought.It's time to keep playing, so I'll leave you all with this:"
Positive,Been a while since i played a good single-player game .                                              -Monkey
Positive,"Brilliant game! Runs well with RTX on, max settings and 4k on a 4090. Kinda lame that 32:9 ultra wide is not supported out of the box but just search youtube for a fix."
Positive,Absolute banger of a game.
Positive,"BMW is like stepping into a beautifully crafted dream, stunning graphics and epic boss fights, but you'll spend more time lost in its massive world than actually becoming the Monkey King! 🐒"
Positive,"Extremely well-polished game with insane production values in every aspect. 10/10 graphics and visual/sound design, great performance considering the visuals, very smooth gameplay, incredible quality and variety of bosses. Level design is better than I expected, the game has tons of branching paths and quite a few secrets big and small. No microtransactions whatsoever. Only downsides are invisible walls everywhere and a somewhat limited moveset on the monke. Play it."
Positive,"The combat is great, the invisible walls not so much..."
Positive,this game is dope but for the love of god pls put in the ost that plays when you are at the hut of immortality in chapter 4
Positive,there cant be a better game than this
Positive,"1. Game of the year 2. Fuck all game medias, and leeches like sweetybaby inc feminist bullshit 3. Fuck all LGBTXJAT propaganda4. Buy the game and play it, you will be impressed."
Positive,"This game will either cure your depression or give you a reason to kill yourself there is no in-between, 10/10 peak gameplay."
Positive,Game of the yearPros:Excellent combatExcellent gameplayExcellent storyExcellent artExcellent character designExcellent voice actingCons:Some fps dropsSome bosses are too easySome enemies are too easy while some are too hardOverall 9.5/10 if not 10/10
Positive,"Just beat the game and achieved the true ending and WOW.This game is easily one of the better games I have played this year and for me personally it was all worth the wait. The graphics, the soundtrack, the story, everything is just a chef's kiss. Take your time, make sure to explore the areas and you can easily get 40+ hours out of this game like I did. And I would only highly recommend to play the game with Chinese audio. The English dub takes away alot from the characters and the overall story (IMO). The ONLY negative I have to say about this game, is that there is input lag. I found myself spamming abilities or heals a lot of times but they never activated (for example RT+LT) but that's really about it. Black Myth: Wukong for me is easily a 9/10, without the optimization/input lag issues it would be a 10/10."
Positive,"Embrace the Monkey.  Black Myth Wukong is a strong action adventure RPG with fluid combat, beautiful visuals, and solid story-telling.  Best of all, the developer has openly avoided political activism that has infested so many games to the present year.  Quite simply, it's just a damn good game and a return to form for gaming in general.  Hope to see a lot more titles like it."
Positive,"Excellent graphics, very optimized. The game can run so fluidly without any issues. The bug that I found is that when during the cut scene, Wukong's mask that equipped during the game was not shown until the cut scene is over. Apart from that, it is a well designed, enjoyable experience.Ps: Journey to the West has been in my childhood days in TV dramas and books. To come in the game, with excellent game mechanics and performance, it will never disappoint you and worth the money spent in a AAA priced game like BMW"
Positive,"This game is like if you put God of War, Dark Souls, and The Witcher 3 in a blender and got the best pieces out of all of them. 10/10 monkey with stick"
Positive,"Wukong isn't open world.. its narrow like Sekiro. Just some Monkey Business...Its not as hard as souls game, although i'm having a hard time.Not punishing at all. you keep what you collect after death.."
Positive,this game is insane and a fricking amazing boss rush 9/10 for me. im really liking my experience and i am for sure going for the 100%
Positive,"It may not be appropriate to call it GOTY, but it is even more inappropriate to call other games GOTY"
Positive,*Kung Fu noises of approval*
Positive,love it combat is exelent story is good and boss fights epic
Positive,"I got bullied by the Tiger Vanguard. This game is skill-issuing me, and I can't stop playing it."
Positive,"Most anticipated AAA game that not disappointed and even exceed expectation. Responsive customizable combat game play, cool boss fight and stunning visual."
Positive,monkesimulator fun yes
Positive,i love being a badass monkey with a sick staff 10/10
Positive,"Love this game, absolutely despise the Yellow Wind Sage."
Positive,game is fun
Positive,No any additional shit values within the industry such as ugly freaks and other SBI stuff.10 out of 10 pure fun.
Positive,BE THE MONKE
Positive,"Most AAA games suck, they are a product of economy big budget games are not made with love anymore.Except for a few games like Wukong! It shows that the devs wanted to create something beautiful, something that they will enjoy making and playing. Also, what a way to showcase chinese myths and culture! This game is amazing."
Positive,"Explore a lot, if you think main bosses are easy, the optional bosses you missed definitely scratch your itchespecially the ones on  chapter 4 and chapter 3 yes, i said  chapter 4 first before 3 , i didn't stutter."
Positive,Lacks diversity 10/10
Positive,"Looks good, plays good, sounds good, feels good, fights good, spanks good (variety of easy and hard bosses)I recommend Chinese voices, English is solid but is based off of Chinese so may seem strange"
Positive,Not wokeNot DEINot a jokeNo CBIGood FPSControls not clunkyTime to say yesTo return to monkey
Positive,"MonkeJokes aside, this reminds me a lot of god of war 2018, it's actually a pretty damn solid game. You have a skill tree that you can reset for free, as many times as you like. Which can make for a bunch of different builds. Visuals are stunning, combos are amazing, which can allow for some mix ups, and enemies feels pretty balanced. I've been enjoying this game thus far. As it offers more to come back to every time I return. I can't recommend this game enough."
Positive,"Imagine that. A 60 dollar game that:- is feature complete- isn't a buggy mess on release- has zero microtransactions or day one DLCs- isn't an always-online live service with a roadmap- has visuals that will blow your balls off- tells an original story with unique lore and setting- offers fun, engaging, and polished gameplay?Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!"
Positive,a blast to play though not as diverse as a souls games for combat the story and the vast amount of bosses made this game a well worth time to play im so addicted to finding all the bosses and secret areas give this a try if you enjoy story rich action rpgs
Positive,"Not typically a fan of ""hard"" games, but with the story, setting, and gameplay, I'm really hooked so far! I would say this is more of a boss rush game than a soulslike. Lots of flashy action sequences and looks stunning on a capable enough rig. I would highly recommend setting the dialogue to Chinese instead of English."
Positive,so a started and the first thing a noticed was Monkey and then a Played Some more and noticed monkey had a stick and then I thought maybe Monkey later on I realized Monkey could stand on stick. Overall Monkey out of 10.Monkey of the Year
Positive,It's a great game so far lad
Positive,haven't finished the game yet while writing this.simple reviewbut this game is simple a 9.5/10 game 100% buy this well worth the money
Positive,Apes Strong United!
Positive,Glory to the CCP!!!!!
Positive,I'm not sure how much I understand the story. But man is it pretty and fun.
Positive,That detail from china's past is real!
Positive,"Other than optimization issues, game is my top release of 2024. To truly have the full experience, Journey to the West is a must read, as the game basically assumes that you have knowledge of the characters and events of the novel."
Positive,Monkey strong together!
Positive,Better than sex.
Positive,"“If you can’t beat them, dress better than them.” - a quote from an actual monkey (sun wukong)"

Positive,Only played 3 hours but the game feels and look absolutely amazing. China Number 1
Positive,The game kinda slaps
Positive,Wow. I have never played a game this good! Recommended.
Positive,BEST GAME EVERRR MONKE POWERRRRRR
Positive,"OK, this is my review for Black Myth: Wukong. After playing 128.9, where do I begin Black Myth? Wukong is so chock full of hidden items and stuff to do it's almost overwhelming.In my first playthrough, I wore a mask that I got from killing a random low-tear boss. This mask increased my drop a ratio of rare items from certain enemies.After beating the game and getting 50% of all achievements, I went back through again to find that I had missed areas, and there are certain enemies you have to grind out to get certain charms. I didn't realize how many enemies there were with these charms.I also learned at the beginning of the game you can only Carey to charm, but once you reach the blacksmith, if you successfully beat the blacksmith, you get an additional slot. I beat the game at this point four times, and I still have more charms to find.On top of this, the first armor you get in the game changes its appearance as you level it up.The staff has dozens of different variations.And there are literally dozens and dozens of side bosses.The game will not bore you.I recommend getting the bad ending first before going after the good.Ending.And this is because it's easier that way.The game has many twists and turns. I'm really trying not to spoil anything.When it comes to a soul, there is no penalty for death, but there's a good reason for that.But it would spoil aspects of the story.You're pretty much playing as a character who has been manipulated by the gods and will no longer be manipulated.That's as far down the story as I can go without spoiling things. Characters are incredibly well done. You meet one character whose main weapon is a rake.As the game goes on, you really grow to love.Please take your time; the game itself is linear.But there are open areas where there's hidden quest Lions characters who can give you upgrades.There's also a system after you defeat a spirit.You can capture it and then briefly transform into it. There's another ability where you can transform into a spurt for a longer time frame.As the game goes on, you are capturing relics. After capturing one relic, you can unlock one ability from the relic. After multiple plate-throughs, you can keep unlocking the relics, pretty much becoming broken.There's an ability where you can make clones of yourself; this ability can be leveled through your skill tree or your relic.There are also multiple stances pending on that kind of staff you are using.Also, there's an item you have: a gourd. This can be leveled throughout the game and eventually can be maxed, but every one of them that you find throughout the game has different perks that you can customize in literally dozens of configurations, but I would recommend that you look up videos on what mistake you shouldn't make right when you start the game.because you can miss so many hidden items and quest lines.But my final verdict on this game is that it is a beautiful game against certain bosses I would get destroyed only to find out.There was a hidden realm that contains a special item that you can use against the boss later.Every quest and side boss matters and helps with the overall main story. It is a masterful game; it reminds me a lot of lies of p in that the game world is so richly packed full of content.I give Black Myth Wukong a 5 out of 5 if your a soul fan, you're going to love this game. And the final boss is probably one of the most surprising fights I've ever had. Plus, they set it up for another game, so I'm definitely buying the SQL. This and the lies of these two games have pushed that needle forward. And the best part is I'm not paying for things that should naturally be in the game."
Positive,F * * K  I G N
Positive,"Amazing game, smooth and gorgeous.i was hyped from the start, became cold feet with time, but i don't regret not listening to usual groups or ""journalists"" (cough cough) and tried to make my own idea of the game, since in case the game isn't for me, i can refund before 2 hours game.it's honestly a good good game, even at high graphics (i can go to very high but at the cost of some fps, which give me headaches).combats aren't as hard as a souls at the moment (maybe later dunno), and combat are dynamics (even if i don't feel hitting the ennemies, it is a little lacking in this regards).run it no problem with amd, with a 2080ti cg.i definitly recommand to play it if you like this type of game.monke brother say banana/10edit after more hours: it's not a souls at all, it's more like a god of war, an action game, don't listen to people on high copium"

Positive,"Here comes the real bomb of 2024. Wonderful art and graphics, fun and full of amazing lore, without any trace of woke shit...Monke is a way of life!!! 9/10."
Positive,game of the year
Positive,"Other AAA games should take a look at this. This is the result of having enough time, passion and determination to tell a good story on top of great gameplay"
Positive,GOTY 2024.God of war on steroids. Git gud game or die a lot
Positive,"Its a great game, if they will keep on releasing bangers like this, I don't mind CCP having my data <3"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a stunning achievement in the action RPG genre! The graphics are absolutely breathtaking, showcasing beautifully crafted environments and character designs that truly bring the mythological world to life. The fluid combat mechanics offer a thrilling experience, allowing players to execute mesmerizing combos and utilize unique abilities.The storytelling is captivating, drawing inspiration from the classic Journey to the West while presenting fresh twists and rich character development. The level of detail in both the lore and gameplay keeps you engaged from start to finish.Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a remarkable game that blends artistry, innovation, and fun. It's a must-play for any fan of the genre!"
Positive,"Overall, a really solid game with a few things holding it back.It's got an excellent combat system that allows for all levels of skill expression, where you can use everything the game gives you for lore-accurate Wukong or none at all if you feel the abilities trivialize encounters. The skill tree system is well done which allows you to create a playstyle that fits you, and the ability for players to reset it for free encourages experimentation.Bosses are the main focus of the game, and level & mob enemy design is sacrificed in favor of that. Most levels are just smashing through weak mob enemies until you reach a boss. This design isn't inherently bad, but I would've loved to see more engaging enemies, creative placements of those enemies, and better environment design so there aren't invisible walls.For a developer that is making a game of this scale for the first time, they definitely got a lot of things right."
Positive,"The variety of bosses you encounter is super cool and there's A LOT of them. The game is just hard enough to challenge you but not so hard that it turns you away from the game. And even playing on low settings, the environment and graphics were amazing. My only real gripe with the game were the invisible walls. Too many times I encountered an area I think I can explore but there ends up being a wall there which takes away from the immersion. Other than that, the game is sick"
Positive,I'm loving the game but the devs need to fix the PS2 (at best) era textures on rocks if possible. Downright embarrassing. Once you reach chapter 2 & 3 it's so noticeable that immersion is difficult. It's a mix of modern textures with ultra low quality ones. Messing with my eyes.The textures and the invisible walls are the biggest issues with the game. Not quite a masterpiece. One day maybe. Still lovin it!

Simple as that, everyone should've known what they were getting into.Also, just turn on fsr and frame generation if you're having low fps/high gpu usage, dumbasses posting negative reviews without even checking out the fucking graphic settings. Literally a you problem and not a game problem."
Positive,The game of the year!
Positive,This mf can clap my cheeks anyday with that staff and I wouldn’t mind
Positive,"great game, I like being a monkey"
Positive,good game play
Positive,"Yep, this was absolutely fantastic. It's more new GoW than Souls, and exceptionally well done."
Positive,return to monkey
Positive,"I would not get this for the story itself, as the quest is a little confusing and the guiding quest tracker light/marker appears very inconsistently so you don't really know where to go, similar to in Elden Ring. There are no difficulty options so it may be kind of hard unless you play a lot of dark souls type games. It is not my personal cup of tea as I mainly play for storylines and it is mostly combat based, but I can see why people would find it fun. The mouse sensitivity mechanics are a bit janky if you are playing with mouse/keyboard.Seems to work fine with my CPU, even though I have an AMD 7700."
Positive,"Its on par with God of War and God of War Ragnarok. Very similar Games. Very good fighting System, Nice skills, nice Level System. Its also a very Pretty Game and is just a nice Chill Game to play, no Wokeness, no forced Western shit.  9.5/10"
Positive,this game is fucking tits

Positive,"great game, great story."
Positive,embrace the monke
Positive,"I'm going to recommend this game but call it what it is. It's basically an indie game with a Triple A Skin.If you just look at the visuals you could believe this is a game as full as God of War, but it is not.If you were to watch any trailers you would think there is a dynamic story, but there is not.If you read the descriptors of the game and compare it to others, a 'souls-like' it is not.It's a fun game. It does not deserve the full price tag. Get it on discount and nothing more. Calling this a GotY is an insult to game developers that actually release a complete game.Anybody who says they like this game because they love Journey to the West makes sense because if you haven't seen Journey to the West you would understand this video game has no coherent story whatsoever.If this is China's first attempt at a Triple A style game it's a good start but at it's best it should be considered an action-indie game with the amount of flaws present."
Positive,"My exploration experience has gone through a long period of setbacks and torment, and for this reason, I decided to stop my journey in chapter 4. However, I am still willing to give this game a positive comment. Extremely high level of completion, beautiful art work, inheritance of lore spirit, excellent soundtrack, and great strike feedback, no just person could ignore these outstanding characteristics. Totally I would like to give it a 9/10, the only drawback is map design. Due to making too many concessions to culture and art, lvl maps are more like art works rather than game maps. There is no landmark in the level map, I got lost many times cuz everywhere looks same, extremely in chapter 3.  Less map guidance also makes key items easily missed out(and these items will significantly affect storyline). I had to seek guides in order to find every key item, but it is unavoidable to be spoiled while searching for information."
Positive,The game feels amazing from what I've played so far.  Can't wait to get into it more.  Finally a game that's actually worth to buy and play in this current era of video games.
Positive,操你妈真是太好玩了，游戏科学你是我爹!This is BRILLIANT. GameScience you did a GREAT job!!!!!
Positive,"Great game, a lot of possible ways to play, doesn't enforce a specific gameplay. Lots of secrets, nice cutscenes, a LOT of content. Even when the game is finished, there is still NG+, that also holds exclusive content/secrets."
Positive,"sick game, difficult but not unfair, learn the games systems and you'll find combat tight and rewarding.  Story and artwork are awesome as well, you will benefit from researching lore beforehand though.  it can get confusing if you are unfamiliar (like me).  Would definitely recommend."
Positive,"The game is extremely gorgeous and cinematic. But the thing is my PC crashed 3 times in only first 15 mins of the prologue and I had to restart the game, and replay the prologue 3 times. I'm using 4080 and somehow it still crashing for some reason.Updated: I decided to take a refund because the game keep crashing extremely so random right now. I don't know is it because of my PC or because of the game. But it is clearly unplayable at this moment."
Positive,God of War of the East.
Positive,Zesty ahhh Monkey 7/10
Positive,Uh Uh Ah Ah
Positive,Monkey with stick
Positive,"Excellent game. I loved the story and all that it consisted of. I think my only gripe would be the RNG farming for specific items that are tied to achievements. I managed to 100% the game and all the achievements within 35 hours. Is it worth the price? Yeah, definitely is. A lot of fun, a lot of content, and unique cinematic moments. I definitely would recommend."
Positive,"The game definitely has issues, mostly based around bosses moving too much and too fast in ways that the camera isnt fast enough track but also sometimes bosses just spam combo after combo and then dodge 50 feet away and it feels like you never get to attack. Some of the bosses are amazing, some are way too easy, some are cheesy and gimmicky, some of them are just painful but you can become powerful as well just not nearly as powerful as some of the bosses you'll fight. So many enemies, so many attacks. There was so much work put into this game you have to respect. It's their first game ever and there's loads of room for improvement and their approach to some of the harder bosses is just absurd but still a decent game.EDIT: The final secret boss is evil it is legitimately not fun. some of the bosses are just straight up oppressive and not enjoyable. I've never played a game where I just put my controller down after an attack not even angry just bored and disinterested because it felt so unfair that I might as well go do something else with my life. I've beaten Sekiro, Lies of P, and still the final secret boss in this game is just so overtuned, over powered and over the top its not fun to fight at all to me. There a few bosses like that throughout so if you dont like hard boss fights dont plan on 100% this game."
Positive,"The combat has less variety than your typical soulslike/lite, but it's staff based style has surprising depth over time, and it hasn't gotten old with nearly 60 hours in the bag. The enemy variety has been incredible, and the bosses all feel different and well thought out so far(just entering chapter 5). Some people might dislike the linear nature of the map design, but if you take the time to look around, you will find more complexity than initially meets the eye. You don't need an open world to have fun, you don't need a million different weapon types to have fun, you need a fun game to have fun, plain and simple. And this game is fun as hell."
Positive,"Extremely good action rpg. If it had better hit boxes and less invisible walls, I'd call it a 9 or 10"
Positive,Wow. just wow!
Positive,im having fun. i like monkie :^) 𓃷𓃷𓃷𓃷𓃷
Positive,Amazing so far. Love it.
Positive,"Very good game, most impressive fantasy action and has itself special, this game should call it the best ""WUKONG LIKE"" game i had ever played. This game is far more make me subrisce in later with it massive fighting system and amazing graphics. Very is nodout a masterpiece worth GOTY  for those players who are fans of ""Journey to the West"" and Sun Wukong"
Positive,"Insane amount of effort put in, compare to this game ('s animations, cg, cut scenes, art works, story, text, culture....) any other soul-like would seem like a indie project, and I mean any. The difficulty can be managed easily even for medium-core players due to relatively friendly farming mechanic (leveling does not give u stat only skill points). There's 5+1 levels with insane map size, packed assets, different monster style in each, huge amounts of music and cut scenes, insane bosses... Everything you see in the trailer is real and touchable, guaranteed. Requires 2070-3070ti to run on high."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is visually stunning and immersive that sets a new benchmark for storytelling in video games. The graphics are nothing short of breathtaking, with highly detailed character designs and environments. The gameplay mechanics are smooth, responsive, and challenging, combining fluid combat with innovative abilities that make each encounter feel dynamic and rewarding. If you are a fan of the God of War series, you would love this game for having almost the same mechanics and game concept. Overall, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a masterpiece that excels in every aspect, from its story and visuals to its engaging gameplay. 10/10"
Positive,"SO far i have played nearly 13 hours exploring every corner still stuck in chapter 2, But Damn i love this game finnaly a game that challenges me .I dont know about the negative reviews about amd and what so ever.i'm using AMD aswell and 4070 Ti graph but no problem at all i can even run it on cinematic  with 90 FPS. and verry high on 120 fps"
Positive,"Shockingly smooth to play. Graphics are top notch. Feels like God of War and Star Wars: Jedi Survivor.Voice acting is good both in Chinese and English. An of course, most importantly, the combat feels great with plenty of challenge.Just finished the game. It truly is a masterpiece. The last boss brings immense challenge, at least for me. One of the best games i've ever played in my 1000+ games library. GOTY. GOTD."
Positive,2024 Game of the Year!
Positive,Monkey + graphic card sure is a nice combo.
Positive,Pretty good dude
Positive,Monke angry.Monke want revenge.Monke get revenge.Monke at peace.10/10.
Positive,Very good game with good combat but invisible walls are annoying. the game is very linear. i give it a 7/10.
Positive,Actually better than Elden Ring.
Positive,Absolutely the best game I played in the past 3 years.
Positive,"Probably one of the best solo games I played. Extremely engaging combat, satisfying progression, powerful story, and plenty of map to explore. And so, so many bosses. So many... My one complaint is that no matter my graphics settings, my PC explodes in the inventory menu. Amazing game, 10/10."
Positive,"Just beat the game, it was a great experience can't say that it was too difficult found myself beating most bosses in under 10 tries. there were some bosses that i struggled with briefly but it wasn't all too bad. The graphics are AMAZING, the combat is great. The decision on all those different animation style during acts was also a great choice.At the end all i can say that it's an amazing game to play and i can recommend it to anyone that enjoys souls-like games. One of my favorite games this year.10/10"
Positive,My CPU is really not that bad but man this game is almost melting it so i sadly have to play on rather low settings! this is however my only complaint! This game has:1. amazing combat which is tough to learn but easy to master2. a lot of amazing bosses (2 that are absolute awful designed and one thats just evil - the rest are pretty much all super fun)3. beautiful ambience and and interesting world design with a lot of secrets!and most importantly 4. the cutscene inbetween chapters are gorgeously crafted and are pure art!overall i personally rate this game like a 8/10 maybe! hope you enjoy it too!
Positive,"Hogwarts Legacy, Stellar Blade, Elden Ring, Black Myth Wukong and other such games immense success really puts into perspective how irrelevant game journalists are & how they exist in an echo chamber. They are disconnected with the end consumers. The end consumers really dgaf about their opinions & it shows in the sales statistics of all the games these games journalists have either tried to cancel or promote. The games they cancel sell millions of copies & some even become GOTY. And the games they try to hype up tank horribly with just some 200 players playing the game lmao.On top of all that the game is amazing and runs fine on ps5 (5hrs played) and PC i am yet to start."
Positive,Glory to the CCP
Positive,Monkey is inevitable
Positive,phenomenal combat. hit boxes are so tight.
Positive,"If you're a fan of Elden Ring, the Souls Series, I would highly recommend this game. Absolutely without a doubt in my mind, a 10/10."
Positive,Re-doing my review got through the intro by putting my settings to the lowest possible during the intro and then changing them back after I got through it. The game is great and I'm enjoying my time. Game Science should be proud!
Positive,"Game is simply GOTY 2024 material. Was gonna wait till I finish the game to post a review but upon seeing some game journalists meltdown over the game's success I decided to do it now. I have to mention Khee Hoon Chan, a brainrot woke hypocrite game journalist who wrote the hit piece on IGN, now wants people to pirate this game. So Khee Hoon Chan, if you happen to see this, you can eat my balls."
Positive,best game of 2024
Positive,"I don't usually write any reviews but goshhh... It is absolutely mind-blowing. It’s more than just a game. It’s like stepping straight into the Chinese mythology with Wukong himself (I know I know, he is/isn't the one). The visuals are insane, the gameplay is extremely addictive, and the challenges pull you right in from the start. It’s like you’re really on this legendary journey...The graphics are honestly something else. Every environment feels alive, from misty mountains to shadowy forests, and the enemies are so detailed they feel like they’re straight out of an old myth. The combat is buttery smooth, too. Every move and transformation just flows and making it so satisfying to play. You can tell the devs really poured their hearts into every detail of this world.The gameplay is as intense as it is rewarding. The combat is strategic, challenging, and never feels cheap. Wukong’s transformations and abilities are epic and add so much fun to the combat. Though you may have to try a few transformations at first to figure out which best suits you ;PHonestly, BMW feels like more than a game...it’s an experience all imho. It brings the old legends to life with a fresh twist that anyone can get into, and Western players like myself will find it especially cool and unique. I seriously can’t wait to see what else the devs have planned as they keep building on this. -- Conclusion ---------------If you’re into interesting myths, epic action gameplay, and jaw-dropping visuals, you have to play this one.10/10 on my list, no bs!"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong – A Masterpiece of Old-School GamingBlack Myth: Wukong is nothing short of a masterpiece. It’s a game that truly reminds us of what gaming is supposed to be: fun, immersive, and a work of art. As someone who has played modern games from Western studios, I can confidently say Black Myth: Wukong stands head and shoulders above most of them.This game embraces what made classic action RPGs so memorable while also pushing the boundaries of modern gaming technology. It’s old-school fun, plain and simple, without any of the gimmicks that have plagued Western releases in recent years. There's no hand-holding, no unnecessary microtransactions, and no bloated downloadable content that should have been included in the base game. This is a pure experience, just like the legendary games we grew up with.In contrast to the Western games that feel more like cash-grabs these days, Black Myth: Wukong focuses on perfecting its core gameplay mechanics. The combat system is challenging and rewarding, drawing inspiration from the Soulsborne formula, but with a unique twist that makes each encounter feel fresh and intense. The visuals and world-building are nothing short of breathtaking. From the mystical creatures to the gorgeously designed landscapes, every detail feels painstakingly crafted to transport you into a living, breathing rendition of ancient Chinese mythology.What sets it apart from Western modern games is the respect it has for the player. There’s no spoon-feeding or over-the-top tutorials. The game trusts you to learn, adapt, and grow, just like the games of the past. You’re rewarded for your skill, patience, and exploration. It brings back that sense of accomplishment that has been missing in a lot of mainstream games recently.The storyline, inspired by the Journey to the West, is both nostalgic and fresh. It combines epic lore with thrilling action, making you feel like you’re part of a grand adventure that transcends time. This is a game for those who long for the days when gaming was about creating timeless experiences, not just selling digital skins or season passes.In summary, Black Myth: Wukong is a must-play for anyone who appreciates true gaming craftsmanship. It’s a brilliant return to form, standing proudly against the wave of modern Western titles that prioritize profit over passion. Highly recommended for gamers who want an authentic, challenging, and deeply satisfying experience!"
Positive,Makes Lden Ring look like an Ubisoft game
Positive,"Overall great game, would not compare it to Souls like games, it's not nearly as difficult and it is more of a linear, arcade type of progression. I would say it is more like recent god of war games, but with more emphasis on combat. It starts light and gets more difficult towards end, i can't say i had any problems before last act. Last fights(Stone monkey and Erlang) were some of the best fights i ever played in a video game. If you are a fan of quick paced combat games i would definitely recommend."

Positive,"Very entertaining game. The combat is fun, smooth, and satisfying. The visuals are incredible. There's a lot of background lore to dig further into for those who like deep lore, since it's based on a real Chinese myth. I have a few minor gripes about some of the ways the difficulty progresses in new game plus 3 and beyond, but overall I had a blast with this game."

Positive,"This was an experience for me, Game Science really delivered a finished product with no bugs or anything of that sort, the game in terms of graphical fidelity really impressed me, the lore and the characters based on chinese mythology were very interesting which made me curious to learn more about. Gameplay has been very good and feels responsive, the only negative things I have to say about it is that some button queues such as using items like healing does not feel reactive as it has a bit of a delay or even sometimes doesn't work at all and exploration could've been more open instead of hitting those invisible walls. It's not super hard but it's not the easiest and the game makes a point of make you remember that on some bosses.The enemy design feels very varied and every boss feels different from each other besides a few repeats, it throws you at so many bosses that you will always be entertained and not feel bored at all, the game ends on a high note leaving you wanting more. In conclusion if you like soulslike type of games or just action in general you should buy it."
Positive,THIS GAME KICKS ASS BUT I CAN BARELY RUN IT
Positive,Absolutely phenomenal game
Positive,The only thing i hate is the dragons and the tigers!!!
Positive,"Extremely Fun game, with great mechanics. I would describe it as more of a souls-lite than a souls-like. There were a few times when I had to stop out of frustration like in Chapter 2. The game is the aftermath of Journey to the West the book the game is based on. Wukong made a lot of enemies and a lot of messes on his adventure. You are “fixing” his past mistakes on your way to becoming him. You meet all the people Wukong once met on his adventures and some are trying to kill you and your people because they believe one of you is the reincarnation of Wukong.You will most likely want to give up on Chapter 2. A shocking amount of the bosses in there are souls-like hard but after that, most of it will be one or two hard bosses per chapter the rest will be challenging but not pull your hair out hard. I highly suggest if you feel as if nothing works on a boss, go and fight something else and come back. The number one reason people give up is because they try to fight one boss for hours, make zero headway, and get bored. Trust me, leave and come back later he’s not going anywhere."
Positive,"CPU: Ryzen 2700X @ 3.5GHzRAM: 32GB DDR4 @ 2000MHzGPU: AMD RX 590 8GB @ 2.2/2.5GHzSettings: 2560x1440 TSR with hybrid High/MedFPS: 40 ~ 64 smooth-------------------------------------------------------Didn't buy at launch because I thought my rig can't handle it, but after trying the Benchmark tool I was surprised at how smooth it ran.The game is extremely fun, though very challenging, it isn't near impossible to beat. Learn to pace the attacks instead of button mashing and time dash well, anyone can defeat bosses with little to no damage taken, it just takes patience and practice. The hit feedback is 120% on point, like you can almost feel your attacks landing on the targets, which is a huge point for me. And of course, I think we're all sick and tired of the same old Medieval/Greek Mythology/Zombie/Military style games from Western studios that often use reskined characters/monsters and animations with clunky combat. This game is not only refreshing, but based on an ancient Chinese Mythology with incredibly fascinating lore that was made with upmost passion. On top of all that, the devs at Game Science are against Wokeism, another huge point for me."
Positive,"Amazing game, Highly recommend"

Positive,The best game I ever played! Straightforward gaming at its best.

Positive,Such an amazing game! Story was nice too
Positive,"Not much to say. I never do reviews but this game is great. 70+ hours this is how all AAA games should be released. Fully developed very little amount of bugs. Plays great on keyboard/mouse. Beautiful art style. Highly recommend for anyone that enjoys games like Remnant, Remnant II."
Positive,"Well, did this game live up to the hype?As of now, yes, yes it did.Now yes, the game is not perfect but literally no game is. But at what it tries to be it is really good.Sure there are a few invisible walls in strange places, big deal, what matters is well executed.I would like to instead pay attention to two other things. 1. This game is not in fact a soulslike, do not eepect one. It is only similar in so far that it's an action rpg. The combat system is nothing like a soulslike, nor are the rpg mechanics. People just call literally every action rpg a souls like nowadays.This game is just not.2. I can't believe that I would ever call people out for something like this but many of the negative reviews are honestly... well racist. Not the bs kind of racist media tries to tell us we are all guilty of, no. Many of the bad reviews call the good reviews no more than China bots and bootlickers. Like, what the actual fuck people, this is a good game and there are A LOT of Chinese people, why the hell are you surprised about the reception? With stuff like Elden ring I did not see such reviews and that game was flawed as fuck. Hell, it probably is the weakest Fromsoftware soulsborn game they made as of now. But there everyone instantly tries to bury people that try to point out it's huge obvious flaws (Like 80% of dungeons and bosses just being copy pasted content or the open world not working long term). But with this game if you don't rate it badly for having some minor flaws you are a Chinese Bootlicker?Get over yourselves people, this is a genuinly well crafted game about THE FUCKING JOURNEY TO THE WEST, the Chinese are damn right to be proud of that. I sure as hell knew I would be proud as fuck if Germany produced a game of this Quality about the Nibelungen."
Positive,"Cocky monkey go reee!This game is a great gear down from FromSoft games. Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodbourne, and Elden Ring are incredible achievements in gaming but of course they set a new standard of difficulty. So far in Wukong, I've found it very pleasantly challenging. I expect at some point I'll run into a boss or two I have to bash my head against a shameful number of times but I believe that will be an exception as it certainly hasn't been the rule thus far.The game looks very good at medium-low settings all the way up to stunning (and I'm not even running RT).Attacks and abilities are satisfying and fairly intuitive to combo. The upgrades are standard action-combat. I do think the UI and art style are pleasing.I found the fighting style options to be a little simplistic but that kind of matches the game, I think, so it's not really a ding. Nioh/Ghost of Tsushima stances I thought were a little involved so Wukong's style (read: heavy attack) options switching using d-pad is nice and ultimately flavor.The tapestry element and animated song between chapters is really nice touch that makes this game stand out a little bit from others. Maybe, just maybe, after years of Soulsbournes and their generally inscrutable thru-lines/connecting elements, having a plainly stated and built story each chapter is more exciting to me than it really is, but that being said, I absolutely love accessibility of the narrative. Best part is that you have to work a little bit to get the whole story (huzzah for secrets and bonus fights!).I was genuinely very skeptical of this game with all the hype flying around but it has exceeded all expectations. Should go without saying that if you enjoy any games of this type (Nioh/Ghost/GoW/DS/etc.) you'll enjoy this game.Give it a try!"

The deep, legendary ambiance that seamlessly blends Chinese folklore with breathtaking imagery captivates you from the moment you enter its gorgeously crafted realm. The attention to detail in every aspect, from the rich landscape to the meticulously designed characters, is just astounding."
Positive,"Hello, I am a 41-year-old father. As you can see from my latest post, I’ve played nearly 170 hours and achieved 100% of the achievements, which is a first for me. No game had ever motivated me enough to want to fully reach this milestone. In fact, the last time I had so much fun playing a video game was when I was a teenager. I must admit that despite my daily responsibilities, Black Myth: Wukong managed to keep me awake on several occasions until 3 a.m.I enjoyed the game so much that I want to take a few minutes to write a small feedback on it.The last action game I played was Samurai Warriors 4-II. I had never played a Souls-style game. A game like Elden Ring felt too intimidating for me on every level. But when I saw streamers playing Black Myth: Wukong, it resonated with my passion for Asian culture in general, and I told myself that no matter how long it took, I would finish this game.I started this game without even knowing if I had the ability to complete it. My first connection with it came from the graphics. The landscapes in each chapter are so beautiful that they calmed me as if I were taking a walk in a national park.The gameplay is incredibly satisfying, and the combat feels amazing. There’s something so rewarding about repeatedly trying to defeat the same boss, starting to anticipate their movements, and engaging in a dance-like battle together. The satisfaction of executing a perfect dodge at the right moment and landing attacks is exceptional.I found the difficulty very well balanced overall. I felt that the first “real boss,” Wandering Wight, acted as a kind of dynamic level equalizer. There are four mobs you can defeat before reaching this boss, meaning that with each attempt, your character gains a bit of XP that lets you level up until your skill and talent are enough to beat him. I don’t know if this was intentional, but regardless, I thought it was great.Speaking of Wandering Wight, I had seen some streamers struggle with this boss, so I knew it might take a while. Indeed, this first real boss was challenging; it took me three two-hour sessions to defeat him. I had so much fun getting beaten by this boss it was an excellent teacher for me. Even my two sons were cheering me on, screaming, and having fun with me. To be honest, Wandering Wight was such a good teacher that very few other bosses posed much of a challenge for me throughout the rest of the game. Here are the other bosses that thrilled me: Tiger Vanguard, Yellow Wind Sage, Kang-Jin Star, Cyan Loong, Yellowbrow, Yellow Loong, Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master (without the needle), Erlang Shen (who took me almost as long as Wandering Wight—around 6 hours), and finally, The Great Sage’s Broken Shell. These were my favorite fights in the game.My one minor negative point was Chapter 6. The ""open world"" that allows you to fly on the cloud is interesting, but without a map, it’s far too easy to get lost, and the graphics are not as appealing. If I have to choose between two evils, I’d prefer that the DLC stick with the invisible walls of Chapters 1 to 5 but maintain the same high-quality graphics compared to what is found in Chapter 6, which breaks a bit of the magic and gives it a “generic and less polished” feel.My only regret about this game is that I didn’t see the previews at the right time, and I wasn’t interested in video games in general before its release, which prevented me from getting my hands on the Deluxe Collector’s Edition that I would have really loved to own.Finally, I want to thank the developers for creating such a good and passionate game.In a few weeks, I’ll attempt the adventure of Elden Ring while waiting for the DLC.Thank you."

Positive,"I like the Black Myth: Wukong game so far, even though I haven't completed it yet, because of its captivating gameplay, stunning visuals, and engaging storyline. The game's combat mechanics are fluid and satisfying, allowing me to unleash a variety of powerful attacks and combos as I navigate through challenging battles. The attention to detail in the graphics and animations brings the mythical world of Wukong to life, immersing me in its rich and vibrant environments. Additionally, the intriguing narrative and character development keep me invested in the game's progression, leaving me eager to uncover more of the story as I continue to play. Overall, Black Myth: Wukong has exceeded my expectations and has quickly become one of my favorite gaming experiences. 10/10 EASILY!!!"

A straight up single player game, no DLC BS outside of deluxe, in and playing after two clicks."

Positive,"This is the most exciting A-RPG game I ever played. The scene is so real and you can even find it in the real world. The game is based on the very famous novel from China and thanks to Game Science to bring it to alive. I as the 80s, this game gives me a lot of memory and finally, we can have our own hero - Sun Wukong. Hopes Game Science continue to do what they want, bring us more games like this."
Positive,"I have never, ever felt so compelled to write a review for a game. This is one of the very very few games in recent memory where there are little to no disappointment and graphical downgrading when compared to the game's initial trailers (that were released 4 years ago!).  The graphics are simply stunning and beautiful, the combat is varied and fun (and difficult), and the lore is extensive and of cultural significance to someone like me and I am sure thousands of others. It is a very challenging game, but it isn't souls-like. I am simply in awe of what Game Science was able to do, from being a mobile game developer up until 4 years ago (and frankly, struggling  to make this game come true) to now, their first flagship single-player game that is so well-received by the player base. The optimization is not perfect, as I do get some stutters here and there. But overall the gameplay is very smooth on a 7800x3d + 4070 Ti Super system (Very High graphics + RT Medium + DLSS), averaging around 110 FPS. Nonetheless, I still think it's incredibly impressive that they managed to make an Unreal Engine 5 game to run relatively smoothly on mid-end systems and PS5s (60 FPS consistently). That alone is an impressive feat. This game is all about exploration. Apparently somewhere about 40% of the bosses are optional and hidden away. I think better map guidance would be incredibly nice, but unfortunately it doesn't exist. Overall this game is easily a 9/10."
Positive,"Reject diversity and inclusion, return to Monke."
Positive,"Well done! Now we need more optimization. Having 45 frames with I9 10850K, 32GB, RTX 4080 it's not the ideal. GPU Usage is 100%, CPU is 20% most part of the time."

Positive,2024/8/21 上手四小时游戏体验  从游戏场景到怪物设计，从建筑到道具的建模，美术设计拉满了，而且还全是中国元素的，这在3A游戏上还是头一回见。另外在虚幻5引擎加持下，游戏画面达到了如今单机游戏的上乘水平，游戏中的风景和建筑经常会使人忍不住驻足观看。虽然刚开始上手的时候有点不适应，但是玩了一会后渐入佳境，逐渐上头。游戏鼓励玩家不断攻击积攒棍式条，因此战斗节奏非常快，总之就是：战斗，爽！除了开场那一幕颇有古惑仔味道之外，后续的台词和配音都是非常牛逼的，我甚至会听完路边的小怪的对话。 游戏里的场景并非所见即所得，有的地方看着好像能走过去，其实有面空气墙挡着，非常反直觉。碰到大型BOSS、会闪现瞬移的BOSS的时候，经常打一半视野就乱飘，不过这也是这类游戏的通病了，隔壁满分神作老头环也是存在这个问题。游戏场景不太有辨识度，且缺乏游戏内地图，再加上弱引导和反直觉空气墙设计，导致玩家经常容易迷路。
Positive,"Have had one crash so far about 30 min into the game. Keyboard controls are fine just takes a bit getting used to dodging with spacebar (by default), since I usually play games like Monster Hunter and Soulslikes with a controller, everything else I play on keyboard and mouse.  Only a couple hours in because I am family sharing it and we only have one copy going around.Beautiful game, but its very heavy on your system. I get mostly a stable 60-70+ FPS on my system with Full ray-tracing on. I haven't tested any higher settings on my system outside of the benchmark, but these work pretty well.If you get any stuttering there is a ""High Priority CPU FIx"" mod on NexusMods.com that changes the game to always run in high priority mode which should help all cpu's stuttering.[PC Specs]CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X3DGPU: RTX 4080 SuperRAM: 64 GB DDR4 @ 3600 mhz[My Game settings]Resolution: 3840x1600 ultrawideGraphics Preset: HighFull Ray-tracing: On (Very High)DLSS: Quality (68% resolution scale)Frame Generation: On"
Positive,Very nice gameplay but also quite challenging
Positive,Bought this game so I can piss off Sweet Baby Inc :)
Positive,monkey game fun
Positive,"It Was a fun Game To Definitely Play.Pros .It was difficult but a good Difficult.Music and Story Telling with Animation cut scenes at the start and end of chapters were Great..There is no Blocking Or Parrying so it was cool to actually Get good at dodging at a game again..Please Note Do not drag the game down just because you have a skill issue.. You Pretty much get to be a monkey and be hated by the higher ups.. The music and story telling do a great Job Especially in Chapters 2 and 4 please note the game does have Replay Value   with different endings..Environment was Really well Designed in Levels i found myself in Different Areas such As a forest  Desert and snow..Your main weapon is a pole that Extends and changes with the skills you choose and build around.you get different abilities and powers which can change the way you fight.Cons .You will have to deal with Difficult bosses at the start of the game Early There is no Difficulty Slider at all so for people who are casuals at gaming this is the not the game for you go back to Pal-world or just get good and watch Walkthroughs or the game has friendly Facebook Community that will help you out.Sometimes i Experienced the Game Crashing during boss fights when using Abilities and powers but that was Quickly patched out and patches are quite large so Be prepared but the game was still worth it.The quest system wont hand hold you so don't expect it to. If you want to know which one it was it was Chapter 2 it had a lot of weather effects plus Boss effects and just overall had a lot going on so therefore it caused a crash.A Lot of people drag the game down over the games Difficulty get over it.When focusing on the main objectives, Black Myth: Wukong is about 35½ Hours in length. If you're a gamer that strives to see all aspects of the game, you are likely to spend around 66 Hours to obtain 100% completion. Depending on how good you are at the bosses and dealing with side quest and Difficult Challenges."
Positive,you get to be a monke and beat things up with a long stick.what more can one ask 10/10+good characters and beautiful world
Positive,I haven’t enjoyed a game this much since Elden Ring.That’s it. That’s the review.Thank you Game Science.
Positive,"One of the best action games I've ever played. Combat is at a high level and is incredibly polished, boss fights are demanding which makes them very satisfying and looks cinematic. Exploration is also very expensive, similar to God of War, pleasant and rewarding, it pays to look into every nook and cranny, the more you play the stronger you become, you can't overlevel like Elder ring where you can easily and sadly kill Margit in a second because you've explored Limbrave or Caelid for too long. After 7 hours I can say that I rate it a solid 9/10 because I miss a few things, but in every game there always has to be something missing.  This is a really strong game, I hope it will be nominated for game of the year because it is a masterpiece in my opinion like Elden Ring or Ghost of Tsushima <3 masterpiece. Edit: After about 45 hours I managed to finish the game. I killed all possible bosses and did almost every chapter in 100% because one quest in chapter four didn't work for me, and I left out a few individual things like meditation spots and the last transformation, which I regret a lot. I can safely say that this is one of the best action games I've ever played 9.5/10, but I do regret a little about the fianl boss because I managed to do it on the first try, Stone Monkey and Wukong Shell, unfortunately it's a pity because I wanted to spend a bit more time on them for the next few hours. I love this game GOTY 100%, I recommend it to everyone."
Positive,🙈🙉🙊󠀡󠀡 we need to go back to monkee
Positive,"When devs. listen to their customers (actual gamers) instead of a bunch of pretentious preachy non gaming snobs (consulting agencies+reviewers) and make great, fun and immersive games you get a GOTY like Black Myth: Wukong."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 atmosphere combined with God of War gameplay, but this time the god of war is actually a god and not a sniveling pussy like rebooted Kratos"
Positive,"Visually stunning advanture game with sould-like elements. Beautiful location design, great animation of enemies. There so many different types of enemies and bosses, and mechanics to beat them all. Many of them need to be explored so search each corner of the map.Monkey see monkey BONK!"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong takes place after the legendary events of Journey to the West, where Sun Wukong, having completed his epic journey and earned immortality, chose to relinquish his godhood. Wukong, true to his rebellious nature, rejected the rules of heaven, preferring the freedom of his old life over the constraints of divinity. He returned to Huaguo Mountain, his wild and untamed home, where he once reigned as the Monkey King.But the gods weren’t thrilled about Wukong’s return to the wilderness. After all, this was the same mischievous spirit who had once defied heaven itself. The prologue of Black Myth opens with a clash between Wukong and the heavenly armies sent to suppress him. The battle is fierce, and though Wukong falls, his story doesn’t end there. His body remains, resting in Huaguo Mountain, while his spirit is shattered into six powerful artifacts scattered across the world.In the game, you play as a monkey warrior who must gather these artifacts to restore Wukong’s spirit. The journey is a continuation of the trials Wukong faced in Journey to the West, with each chapter echoing the 81 calamities he once overcame. This first chapter pits you against the remnants of those ancient challenges, all within a world that has moved on since Wukong’s original adventures.To truly appreciate the depth of Black Myth: Wukong, it helps to be familiar with the classic story and Buddhist concepts that underpin its narrative. The game’s story is rich with references to Wukong’s past, and the combat is nothing short of exhilarating, blending the mythological with the primal.For me, this game is not just about the epic battles or the stunning visuals. It’s about Wukong’s choice to reject the constraints of heaven and embrace his true nature. It’s a powerful reminder to ""embrace monke"" – to hold on to the wild, untamed parts of ourselves, even in the face of overwhelming odds. Black Myth: Wukong doesn’t just let you play as the Monkey King; it invites you to live his philosophy. And in a world that often pushes us to conform, there’s something profoundly satisfying about embracing the ""monke"" within."

Positive,"reject woke, embrace monke"
Positive,"Incredible journey, truly an experience. If you enjoy action combat games this is a must play, only complains is that traversal and regular enemies are rather boring, and serve no purpose other than just to populate the world, but the bosses are amazing, and there are over 90 of them."
Positive,"10/10 embrace monkestunning graphics, fun and challenging but not punishing (doesn't take away your exp or money/will points whenever you die), so you can grind if you want to (not that you need to). Exploration is rewarded. pick the original Chinese/Mandarin voiceover with English subs for the best experience if you are an English speaker!"
Positive,"Great game, but for the purposes of review I'll be brief about the positives, as I find them to be largely self-evident. The game is very obviously beautiful. You travel through varied locales and see many creatures from Chinese folklore. The combat system rewards aggression in a way that I feel it's inspirations like Elden Ring could benefit from. Wukong is a very long adventure for the kind of game it is and, unlike Elden Ring, it's not saturated with filler and bland open-world sandboxes (that's not to say I don't like Elden Ring, but a spade's a spade). While this game is very different and distinct from Elden Ring, I find it a useful comparison as many people have played it.My main criticisms are the difficulty. While there are some excellent, highly challenging fights that can really get your adrenaline pumping, too many of the bosses, in fact I'd go as far as to say the vast majority of them, have far too little HP. There are lots of well designed and interesting bosses with varied movesets and great set-piece presentation that simply fall to their knees at the sheer strength of all the tools at your disposal. Even without even using medicine buffs, transformations, or ""Pluck of many"" (summons many clones), you can simply flowchart your way through most fights without any regard for what the enemy is doing. I understand there's a type of gamer who abhors any challenge and screams with indignation at the mere concept of having to learn your enemies movesets before winning, but I feel like a game that draws inspiration from the ""Soulslike"" genre should be a bit more brave about challenging the player. Most of the challenging fights in this game are hidden in secret areas. While breezing through most fights and being a completionist regarding every boss, I beat the game in about 40 hours. For an extremely high production value game with lots of set piece events, that is insanely long. If the game deigned to give most bosses an HP pool long enough to actually challenge the player I could imagine myself having spent 60-80 hours to beat the game. What I mean to say is that the game is very dense and even though save for some exceptions largely unchallenging, it's an incredible adventure just for the spectacle alone and rarely wastes your time. I would say the only times I felt were very dull and drawn out were some parts of Chapter 3 where you're running across the snowcapped mountains fighting the same frozen humanoids over and over again. The level design in Chapter 3 is very tedious and empty compared to the spider cave in Chapter 4.In general, I've come to prefer the more linear level design with branching paths than the open world POI slop of modern generations, so it's very nice to see that in Wukong. However, one major flaw I find with the level design is how many invisible walls there are. Sometimes they're necessary, but they're used too liberally in this game and can really take you out of the experience. Sometimes they're placed very oddly, before a natural wall which could just as easily prevent you from running out of bounds. Sometimes cliff edges have invisible walls, on rare occasions they don't and you fall to your death. Sometimes the game will train you to think some unassuming corner has an invisible wall like so many other paths that look traversal at a glance, only to be one of the exceptions that leads you to a chest or a secret area. There's very little consistency to the boundaries in this game and it often feels like the levels were designed more to be pretty than playable. With that said, some levels are very good about this like the aforementioned spider caves of chapter 4, where what you see is what you get, and you can easily look with your own eyes and tell where you can and can't adventure, with many branching paths. Overall I got the impression that the developers became more conscientious of this as the game went on.  The criticisms I have of the combat system might be a bit too esoteric and hard to understand if you haven't already played the game, so I will be brief and say that ""varied combos"" I feel are too weak and wonky to use with staves compared to saving your focus points and acquiring focus through perfect dodges. Varied combos are much better with ""spear"" type weapons, but there are literally only 2 spears in the entire game and none of them have upgrade trees. Varied combos are borderline unusable as a defensive utility with staves because they cannot be used to cancel attack animations in the same way normal dodges can, and since the input cannot be delayed at the end of the attack animation it's just terrible to use. Spears do not have this problem, and the final spear makes the thrust stance varied combo strong enough to make it a very compelling option. The only problem? You don't get that spear until the very end of the game from a secret boss. My final complaint is the performance. Throughout the game you experience traversal stutter which is very distracting and annoying, much more annoying than simply having low FPS. This occurs on all PC's even with leading hardware at least according to reputable tech outlets like Digital Foundry. It's always noticeable but it's flat out obnoxious in piece sections where the camera moves from areas very fast. However bad the performance is throughout the game, it's by far most egregiously terrible in Verdant Hills in chapter 6. This is unsurprising because the game presents you with the ""Somersault Cloud"" where you traverse a wide open world area which, consequently, is much more taxing on your hardware than more structured and smaller scale controlled environments. Thankfully the final boss transports you to a different area but there are something close to a dozen bosses in the verdant hills where you must suffer the terrible performance within. With a 4080 super and a 7800x3d I couldn't manage to get 60fps without dramatically lowering the settings compared to other areas which run much more smoothly. Again, I must reiterate that I wanted to focus on my criticisms for the review, but I also want to reiterate that this really is an incredible game and a fantastical adventure. Easily a contender for my personal game of the year, and likely the same in a slower year. I would go as far as to say a cheap and dirty mod that doubled or even tripled the HP of most of the bosses would elevate this game dramatically. I look forward to more games from Game Science as this is a really incredible first title with a new IP (for games anyways)."
Positive,"This is a masterpiece.The story takes place in Sun Wukong after completing the scriptures, due to its powerful ability by heaven beware, Sun Wukong is not allowed to return to the flower fruit Mountain. In the battle, Sun Wukong is killed by Yang Jian, the goddess of Erlang, and his body is transformed into four treasures that are lost all over the world. Players play as a member of Monkey Sun, a monkey in Huaguo Mountain, and embark on a journey to collect treasures and revive the Monkey King.Black Mythology is a third-person role-playing game that adds a lot of new Settings and gameplay, such as immobilizing and transforming into a monster you defeat. The player, also known as the Man of Destiny, can choose one of three enhanced hits during battle, combining various avatar and amazing transformation skills to defeat a wide variety of monsters. The combat experience is very smooth and is a good example of modern role-playing games.The construction of the environment of the game is also clever, combined with the traditional Chinese feng shui scenery, to bring players a different game experience. The only drawback is that the game does not have a map function and there are air walls in some areas, but I believe that the production team of Black Mythology will gradually fix and improve these minor flaws based on player feedback.All in all, this game is the first AAA game made by a Chinese team, and it is well made, the combat experience is smooth, and the striking feeling is great. Knowing a little background story before you play can make your gaming experience even better.Becoming the Monkey King is one of the childhood dreams of every Chinese child. Thanks to the production team for helping us realize our childhood dream. I hope the production team will continue to make such excellent games, so that players around the world can fully understand the Chinese mythology system and the Chinese fantasy rooted in the heart of every Chinese. It is hoped that the road of independent stand-alone games in China will become wider and wider, and provide real ""diversification"" for the game industry."
Positive,"I love this game!It looks abslutely gorgeous, a truly next gen game with stunning graphical fidelity and inccredible animations!But the most important thing is that the bosses are cool and the combat is fast-paced and super fun! It's very fluid and highly dynamic, when you get used to it.The difficulty is not too high - it feels like the developers focused the most on every encounter being fun, rather than inventing new ways to screw over players.I wouldn't call it ""souls-like"", because the term is so over-abused. Everything is ""souls-like"" novadays. Even when the souls-series didn't invent any of the things that are attributed to it - like checkpoints, health flask and dodges.BM: Wukong plays more like action games such as old God of War - it's a spectacle.The world is bright and colorful. It is a fairly measured and linear experience with some side paths and hidden areas to explore.Unlike the souls-series where the lore is a bunch of obscure scattered paragraphs that require a 5 hours youtube essay to understand, in Wukong the journal is a delight to read - it tells chinese myths and tales with morals and lessons at the end, all the while it intertwines into a grander narrative.Each new boss I encounter is a treat. They have unique moves and mechanics, arenas, music.It doesn't take long to figure out what they do. Usually I beat them after 2-4 tries. Some even on the first try. The UI in this game also deserves some credit. It is clean and easy to read and navigate.I have some complaints about BM: Wukong as well. But they are minor and are easily fixable.First - the game doesn't let me bind anything on my side mouse buttons. So I decided to use controller instead. However, it woulnd't be too difficult to re-map the side mouse buttons so that the game would think that I'm pressing some keys on the keyboard instead. There's plenty of software that would help you do that.Second - the default FOV is very narrow for my taste. And vignetting makes it even worse for me. There is a fix for that on github, though: https://github.com/Lyall/WukongTweak/releases. It's easy to install and helps to adjust FOV, sharpness and disable vignetting. I personally went with +15 to default FOV (the game uses vertical FOV so +15 makes a big difference), set sharpness to 2.5 instead of default 3.6, left chromatic aberration enabled (it's not overbearing at all) and disabled vignetting.I had a rocky start with the game. Whenever I tried to run it my PC would freeze, with the only option is to hard reset. I have a defective PCU in my PC, though, with coils that start to whine whenever my graphics card works at full power, so I wouldn't blame this on the game. I tried installing new drivers, as well as going back couple of versions. In the end I just launched the game in compatibility mode and it was a smooth sailing from that point on. Haven't encountered any issues.I was afraid that the english localization would suffer, but the vast majority of voice acting is great. And the text is well-written. The only issue is lip sync, that was done for chinese voiceover. But I stopped paying attention to it after a while. Just imagine you're watching old Jackie Chan movies with english dub.In conclusion - Black Myth: Wukong is an amazing debute of the Chinese game developers to the global market. This game is an incradible achievement in setting the level of quality for true next gen.I would absolutely recommend everyone who loves action combat games and ""souls"" games to try it!"
Positive,"Bought this game because the studio, allegedly, didn't let some fraudsters bully them in tarnishing their own idea of their own game for the sake of being 'diverse' and 'inclusive'.  If it turns out to be a decent game, that's another positive.  Sad that it's come to this."
Positive,Rare thing for a game to actually play how it looked in trailers
Positive,This game makes me wonder what wealthy Western devs like EA and Ubisoft are even doing. It is an absolute privilege to play Wukong!
Positive,"Better than I expected, highly recommend!"
Positive,"That game....That creation...That game has a soul... not all game have a SOUL like in this game...So pick your way and go to... offer incense, Monkey King !"
Positive,"Good game, but here are some cons:Speechless Monkey: You are introduced to a charismatic Wukong, but then given a monkey that never talks throughout the game.Chapter 4 – Small Bridge with Cocoons: I hope that this great idea was implemented for a good reason.Bosses That Can Be Missed Forever: Hi to the Scorpion lrd and the Bat.Missing Sound During Cutscenes: This happens randomly, but it’s true.Missing Horse Quest: You can’t see me in the next chapters, resulting in an incomplete quest for you."
Positive,"Now you see. Sun Wukong was born from a stone, therefore they are non-binary, which aligns they with the LGBTQ community. Additionally, since they became a monk, they have also become a vegetarian. They created havoc in the god's realm to prevent their fellow monkeys from being persecuted, marking them as noble animal rights activist. Having been oppressed under the Five Finger Mountain for 500 years, they gained a deeper understanding of freedom, making them a liberal. They address women as ""Bodhisattva,"" showing respect for women's rights, which aligns with feminism. Their efforts to extinguish the flames of the Flaming Mountain demonstrate that they are an environmentalist. The storyline of the Kingdom of Women, with male surrogacy and abortion being legal in this chapter of the story, reflects a progressive stance on reproductive rights. How could anyone say that such a character, embodying minority rights, LGBTQ representation, vegetarianism, animal rights, feminism, environmentalism, and liberalism, is not inclusive and lacks diversity?"
Positive,"Def good game, I'm a huger martial arts fan and personally I  like the fact you can focus on just foundation or if you choose to you can do more spiritual/ magic arts. currently I'm running full dodge build and its very enjoyable being able to pull off all the perfect dodges!!"
Positive,"literally cannot figure out where to go without walkthroughs, hitbox on a few bosses/enemies is wonky. But other than that, absolutely fantastic game, somewhere in between God of War 2018 and Elden Ring."
Positive,clears elden ring
Positive,"The opening sequence gave me the CHILLS and a feeling of nostalgia for so many things I grew up with, truly incredible so far. SUPPORT GAME SCIENCE!"
Positive,"Awesome game, like it"
Positive,monkee game good
Positive,"This game will go down in history as one of the greatest modern games of all time.  I was truly blown away at how immersed and invested I got in this game.  I haven't felt that playing a game since God of War or Witcher 3.  And not to mention, this is from some random studio that happens to be their FIRST ever game made.  Graphics were stellar, combat was next level, and the exploration with secrets and lore to uncover was second to none.  All of the cutscenes and cinematics made it feel like you were playing a movie.  I have never played a ""souls"" game either and had really no trouble beating every boss this game had to offer.  Some were a bit tough but I think the longest I ever spent was maybe 45 minutes on the secret final boss which was the sickest fight I've ever seen in a video game.  I have no doubts it will win GOTY, nothing can hold a candle to this.  10/10"
Positive,"This is undoubtedly a boss brawler in and out and a very good one! Some may feel it to be lacking, with no side-quest and no open world, but it reminds me a lot of the original GOW in its linear progression. That is a breath of fresh air, as its progress and game-play are not weighed down by distractions and meaningless quests.Like many, I initially thought this would be a souls-borne game, but it's not; the closest it comes to is Sekiro without the traversal. Again, this is yet another point in its favor.Here is my impression of the first two chapters:I dont believe this is one of those games you need to complete the first chapter to find its for you or not. The game does a swell job of presenting you with what this game is within the first 30-minutes.Chapter 1 Took me approximately 9 hours to complete. As you scale the mountain it make sense that the world would feel linear and closed off. The forest foliage is amazing for the setting. The opening sequence was pretty epic and sets the tone of the game almost immediately, before setting you off on your journey.Chapter 2The game opens up a bit more. took approximately 6-7 hours to complete.This portion of the game while is still not ""open world"" it presents different paths. Given the transition to a new area it would make sense that the world would feel bigger, this also pair very well in the story.What threw me off initially is that at some points I would find myself behind enemies (unclear if that was intentional or if I was poking around too much) but this doesn't hinder the game.So far every zone feel fresh with new enemies types being presented. It does in fact feel as if you are on a journey (to the west).VisualsBeautiful and demonstrate what Unreal Engine 5 can do.There hasn't been a single moment while playing that I feel this game was downgraded from what was presented in its announcements or trailers. Along with in-game cut scenes there are some more traditional animations that are well delivered and a fun surprise!Combat and Game-play solid!General combat is great: Successful dodges are rewarding rather than a cheap maneuver, and staggering enemies with combos is just plain fun! Between bosses there are minor encounters that align well with the area (and bosses) design.Spells (General): are well suited, despite the name its not a  wave of a wand but a stroke of your hand that changes your physical form or state of an enemy and can at time dramatically change a boss fight. (as I learned with cloud step against a wind based boss). Technically in the game general spells, spirits and transformations are labled as ""spells"" but breaking those up here.Spirits: are not a summon, but a temporary transformation that may add a benefit to your combat (may be one of my least favorite element at the moment as I am still learning how to use them properly).Transformation: unlike the spirits feel powerful (quite honestly I'd rather drop spirits and just have transformation all together)The sound DesignA perfect match!Music is not overbearing/distracting from the game. I really enjoy hearing an enemies taunt interrupted with a smack of my staff.StorytellingStraightforward (presented through cut-scenes and npc interactions).I don't know the source material ""Journey to the West"" to speak to how closely related. However, you'll recognize elements in this story that have been used as references for popular anime (if that's your thing)"
Positive,"I did not expect Black Myth: Wukong to be this good. It has exceeded all expectations and is a strong contender for Game of the Year 2024. When it was first revealed in 2020, many, including myself, thought it looked too good to be true—a hyper-detailed, visually stunning game with interesting combat from a unknown random @$$ studio in China. But now, in 2024, the game has released, and it has completely SHATTERED my expectations.From the stellar combat to the insanely hyper-realistic world, Black Myth: Wukong is a visual masterpiece. The game fully utilizes Unreal Engine 5’s cutting-edge technologies, including Nanite, Lumen, and Niagra, along with path-traced global illumination, reflections, water caustics, and much more aided by the NVIDIA branch of the engine. This is the first game I can genuinely consider next gen and has maximized the use of Unreal Engine 5, and the results are nothing short of breathtaking. The game’s progression systems are rich and engaging, constantly drawing you into its world and encouraging exploration to uncover secrets that aid your journey. With 90 bosses, each with unique movesets, the game offers a variety of challenges that keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. Some bosses push the difficulty to the extreme, rivaling and even surpassing the challenge found in most Souls-like games.Combat in the game is super responsive, fluid, gorgeous to look at and the camera ACTUALLY FUNCTIONS. The abilities you unlock are very satisfying to use, and the skill trees provide meaningful upgrades that encourages build diversity. The armor system is well thought-out, incorporating set bonuses for collecting full sets, which adds another of complexity and build diversity.I completed the game in just over 40 hours, and by the end, I was completely blown away. Returning to get the true ending and facing Erlang was a monumental experience. The difficulty, the intricacies of the moveset, the visuals—everything culminated in a final battle that was nothing short of cinematic brilliance. The game has easily solidified itself as one of my favorite games in the past couple years."

Positive,At the moment this is my game of the year loved just about every moment apart from some performance problems (stutter) and this game is extremely demanding especially with RT on I had to turn it off on a 4090 at 3440-1440. but now on to the gameplay it’s a mix of god of war and dmc with a very small bit of dark souls. the atmosphere to the music to the bosses are fantastic while some bosses are hard but I wouldn’t say too hard well apart from from one a secret one.
Positive,"Jogo incrível. Me diverti demais. Platinei em 80 horas, platina divertida, apesar de ter alguns itens bem chatos de conseguir, que depende de RNG, mas há sempre um jeitinho brasileiro para contornar essas coisas.Ótima história, a mitologia é muito cativante e prende a sua atenção.O combate e a progressão é realmente impressionante. Tem muitas variações de estilo de combate e várias builds para você testar, o bom é que é muito fácil de resetar a árvore de habilidades, não precisa gastar itens nem nada, com 1 clique você reseta tudo e consegue testar novas builds.Design de chefes não tem nem o que dizer, gráficos incríveis e realistas.Enfim, não há nada mais para dizer, é o jogo do mamaco, combate envolvente, história cativante, jogabilidade satisfatória, e muita diversão garantida."
Positive,Not at all a Dark Souls gamer but this shit was good. Love Wukong story
Positive,superb game. i think it should be GOTY
Positive,"Excelente gameplay. Justo! Gráficos estonteantes, som soberbo, character design incrível, história fantástica, progressão instigante. Muitas ferramentas para enfrentar desafios!"
Positive,Best game for players that are not good at soul likes
Positive,"Game Science did a remarkable job adapting the classic Journey to the West story. They masterfully captured the essence of the legendary tale, blending mythological elements with fresh, modern twists that keep the experience engaging for both newcomers and fans of the original. The characters are richly developed, and the narrative seamlessly weaves together the epic journey, with all its trials and lessons, into a beautifully crafted world. Their attention to detail and respect for the source material is evident, making the game a standout homage to this timeless story. I am excited to see if they plan on rolling out a DLC in the future. However I still have to give the game a thumbs dumb for a few reasons. The first reason is the playstyle from chapters 4-6. In chapters 1-3 the team did a fantastic job with all the mechanics and it was fun to try out different abilities. Once you get into chapters 4-6 a lot of the fun playstyle went out the door and the game turned mostly into spam dodging and relying on light attacks. Even when it came to gourds in the first half of the game I felt confident to get off a heal while in the back half of the game not so much. My second reason is the consistent use of losing damage in cut scenes/un-skippable animations. Even when you get a perfect perfect dodge, bosses would still get off an un-skippable attack that would drain ¼-½ your life. Experienced this mostly right after I would get a successful gourd/heal off. Going deeper many bosses in the second half of the game would repeatedly do this during their second, third and or even fourth phase. It was interesting that within some of the phases of boss fights that there would be checkpoints I do not know why they felt the need to do this. This was seen with fulfilling the secret bosses throughout chapters 1-5 that would help you unlock the final secret ‘good’ ending. Which even once you complete you have to go and finish the ‘bad’ ending to still complete the game. If you like to 100% games, you will have to farm for certain items to complete achievements. Some of the items are NG+ or even worse RNG, which means you might not get them for who knows how many tries. Some of them you can't just rest at a shrine and come back and try again because they only appear every half an hour and you have to go to another shrine and come back after said half an hour. One item has only 5 trees from which you can farm over three locations in the whole game which alone took me over 5 hours with 3 Golden Carp curio’s equipped. Lastly this AAA game when it first released had some bugs not many, but what made me the most upset was spending 20 hours loading through different cut scenes just to continue the game on my first playthrough. This factor alone is why I have to sadly give this game a thumbs down. (I will give it a thumbs up in the review, but if you read this I am more on the thumbs down side) If I did not have to spend 40+ hours of my life getting through cut scenes or farming items to 100% the game my stance would change. I still think what Game Science released was one of a kind and something future games for the next decade will study and incorporate… build upon. My last note is while this game was super interesting and fun to play I hope when/if a DLC comes out that new cycles has a little bit more flexibility or new in-corporations to the game so it is not so repetitive. I can not be mad/upset or judge a game based on this, but I believe the game would have been better off if they only kept this version to the first 3 chapters and added more lore within + a DLC. Then in the upcoming years released a part 2 to the game for chapters 4-6 with a separate DLC. I do not also understand why journalist where no naive with their articles before release they truly are suckers for stating what they believed and got it all wrong. You should definitely try out this game if you are into single player action/souls like games, after you play it you will understand that this game is in a category of it’s own. Sorry for this yap fest. Is this GOTY??? Maybe because of the publicity and units sold, but I think it will win the other categories such as best narrative/soundtrack etc.. While Space Marine 2 takes home GOTY. ---{ Graphics }---🔲 Awful🔲 Bad🔲 Will do🔲 Decent (Nothing special)✅Stunning✅ Visual Masterpiece (if I wasn’t playing on a toaster maybe)---{ Gameplay }---🔲 Bad🔲 Okay🔲 Nothing special🔲 Good✅ Very good✅ Try not to get addicted---{ Audio }---🔲 Bad🔲 Not too bad🔲 Decent🔲 Good🔲 Beautiful✅ Masterpiece---{ PC Requirements }---🔲 Potato🔲 Decent🔲 Fast✅ High-end PC🔲 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer---{ Difficulty }---🔲 Just press a bunch of buttons🔲 Easy🔲 Significant brain usage✅ Easy to learn / Hard to master🔲 Difficult🔲 Dark Souls✅GOW/Sekiro---{ Grind }---🔲 Nothing✅ Only if you care about 100%🔲Average grind level✅Too much grind🔲 Insanity---{ Story }---🔲 None/Not important in this game🔲 Bad🔲 Average🔲 Great🔲 Well written✅ One of the best i've had the pleasure of playing---{ Price }---🔲 Free🔲 Cheap🔲 Under priced✅ Acceptable price🔲 Overpriced🔲 Complete waste of money---{ Bugs }---🔲 Never heard of🔲Minor bugs✅ Can get annoying🔲 Proceed with caution---{ Length }---🔲 Very Short (0 - 4 hours)🔲 Short (4 - 10 hours)🔲 Average (10-30 hours)✅ Medium (30-50 hours)🔲 Long (50-100+ hours)✅ For 100%: 130 hours🔲 No ending---{ ? / 10 }---🔲 1🔲 2🔲 3🔲 4🔲 5🔲 6🔲 7✅ 8🔲 9🔲 10"
Positive,Monkey have pole = good game.
Positive,"To me this game is 9/10. The more I play it the more I like it. Visuals and art direction is incredible. Story is really interesting and I keep wanting to play the game more. Other incredible thing is that each boss is not only visually unique, but also combat and movements are unique for them as well. This applies to optional bosses too.I’ve found exploration to be really well done. The scenery is beautiful and you encounter unique, breathtaking locations with unique enemies. You are also allowed room to explore, beat bosses in different order and find hidden things in the process.The game is very difficult and you can choose what kind of combat do you want to have from three different staff stances. There are plenty of (hidden) optional bosses or areas that you can explore to get a little bit stronger that will make the difficult boss very manageable to beat.So far I’ve played 30 hours and I’ve started chapter 3 two hours of playtime ago. There are five chapters and each chapter is more difficult. I would assume that you will spend 10 to 20 hours per chapter.The only two things that I’ve noticed could be better is facial animation when characters speak but I think it’s because the animation was made for Chinese originally and I play in English so it’s alright. The second thing is sometimes camera locks to a completely wrong enemy and I cannot rotate it so it’s really annoying when I’m surrounded and it just wants me to look in certain direction. I haven’t experienced this issue until chapter 3.Overall, it’s super rewarding game and I really recommend it."
Positive,i embraced monke
Positive,"Its not dark souls but it can be a prelude to it, you can figure out if you want to buy elden ring after playing this gameBest monkey game ever"
Positive,goated goty for sure 👍
Positive,"One of the greatest game ever made!!! The story can be a bit confusing if you've never watched Journey To The West. However, once you know the background of all character, this can be the most interesting culture and historical educational story ever made."
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong :PC Specs used for this review:RTX 4070 SUPER 12ɢʙIntel i5 14400F16GB 6000ᴍʜᴢ RAMFULL PC SPECS IS ON MY PROFILEPros :+ Insane graphics+ Aesthetically pleasing sceneries+ Satisfying and impactful combat + Huge variety of bosses with different fighting patterns+ Headless bard has some sick beats+ 齐天大圣Cons :- Maps are not as explorable with invisible walls- Some stuttering - Linear gameplay (Boss after boss)""Black Myth: Wukong"" is inspired by Journey to the West and features stunning visuals and detailed environments. Its combat is fluid and satisfying, and it is more reminiscent of Sekiro than Dark Souls. I have been waiting for this game to be release and I’m thoroughly enjoying the game and finding the overall experience to be highly immersive. Must try :D☆☆☆☆ 9.5/10"
Positive,"Style over substance. Mechanically, Wukong is very basic, but the execution is crispy. If you're looking for an open world exploration game with deep character customization and complex min-maxing inventory management, this probably isn't the game for you. Personally, I'm a fan of the Monkey King as a mythical character so I'm a little partial. He's a silly monkey but also a formidable badass. I loved the Forbidden Kingdom movie with Jet Li and Jackie Chan.It's a boss rush game. You progress from hub map to hub map and defeat the bosses inside those maps to progress to the next one. You'll get your butt kicked by bosses but every time you respawn, you come back slightly wealthier than before in terms of knowledge and resources. In that respect, it's a very forgiving game. On its surface, I could see why people might think this is a souls-like game but it feels like a more rudimentary 90s/00s era action RPG. The animations, models, environment, music, voice acting, are all fantastic. The combat feels fluid but there's not a whole lot to it. You're going to do rote memorization of enemy telegraphs and come back with slightly improved stats and eventually beat them, so the game really wants you to progress and beat it as opposed to more punishing RPGs like souls-like genre games. There's really not a lot going on in terms of crafting either. Again, this feels like a game from an earlier generation (not necessarily a bad thing, but a lot of people want something a little deeper). The bosses are challenging enough to keep me engaged and I love the overall aesthetic and the feel of the combat. It's a solid 7/10 game for me, but if it looked like crap, I don't think I would've been interested. My main gripe is that I wish it had more going on mechanically. I don't think this game is GOTY material but it might be the coolest looking game of the year. The modeling/animation folks deserve a golf clap because they really nailed it and did a beautiful job. Aside from watching trailers of the game, I've gone into this blind and I recommend other people do the same. There are likely a bunch of videos telling you how to cheese certain bosses and I feel like that would ruin what little complexity is on offer. Once the nuts and bolts of a game are exposed, it kinda ruins the magic of it. Just an aside: There's a lot of positive and negative review-bombing which I think is heavily politicized. I don't know if it's backwash from all the DEI buzz earlier this year, but it's irrelevant and you should ignore it. I think at least some of it might be from anti-China sentiment here in the west and that's unfortunate. Chinese developers have been consistently impressing me recently with a lot of localized indie titles and I'm adding this one to the list. It's a very well-polished game and deserves whatever accolades it gets for its presentation."

Positive,"I changed my stance on this game, coming from souls games this needed quite some adjustments in my playstyle which was quite frustrating in the beginning, up until chapter 2 it started to shift and I got a better feel for this gamewhat makes it so good is that it is not following fking crooked western publisher mechanics to squeeze the money out of everything... you buy it, you play it and nothing is hidden behind a paywall or stupid battlepass or dlcsand NOT to forget IT RUNS STABLE AF no stupid BS and lack of optimizationthis alone makes it worth a buy, to see it still is possible to have a solid game with a single buy"

EDIT: It is fixed"
Positive,"Just got past the first chapter (About 3~ish hours in), and it feels pretty great in my opinion. The learning curve is easy to work with, combos get better the more points you put into your stances, and the movesets/hitboxes feel really well choreographed. My framerate isn't the best but I also have an older system, I'm gonna chalk that up to me and not the game. It's never enough to be a problem though, just heavily fleshed out areas or heavy cinematics will have a blip now and then.There are plenty of stories, mythos, and side-areas to keep you going for a good while it seems, The areas feel like just about every inch was sculpted bit by bit rather than filling a map with things to do.Feels like good enough of a ui and system that if you've played any sort of soulslike before, you'll likely feel comfortable after learning it. All in all I'm looking forward to the rest of this game."

Positive,fuck those journalists. Monkey time.GOTY <3
Positive,"For anyone who crashes after the intro fight on a NVIDIA graphics card, update your drivers, it fixed the issue completely for me. God of war but more boss fights and the inbetweens aren't as fun. Combat feels enough like a souls game that the controls feel weird at first and lock on tethering when dodging feels off and causes some camera issues in combat. Music videos between each act are great, immediately change the game audio to Chinese."
Positive,"I'll be one of the many reviews to say this game has delivered amazingly well.I had my initial apprehension because I heard the game was very linear, but it is not THAT linear. Think of it almost like dark souls 2 where each main area (chapter) doesn't connect with each other but each map has plenty to do and explore. Some of the chapter main maps are more linear and/or disconnected than others but I have yet to feel like I am lacking in the ability to explore.A big word of warning (which is a bonus for many) is that there are a lot of bosses in this game concentrated in each map. You have main bosses and optional bosses width actual life bars at the bottom; and you also have minor 'bosses' who are stronger version of the regular mobs in the levels.There isn't a traditional variety of weapon styles, all of the weapons you can get and craft are based around the staff. But the combat variety comes from the wide range of builds you can make with the difference stances, magic and other skill trees.Performance isn't the best in the world but the game is decently optimized. This is now something to stress considering the amount of games releasing with horrible pc ports.Finally as far as music, story and general presentation this game has been amazing. The general lore and setting are breathtaking. There are fantastic set pieces, and the levels and battles ooze with personality. There are also these great cutscenes /short stories around each chapter that have different styles and have many times left me crying.There aren't many games this year that could potentially beat this for the GOTY award. And to be fair, some i haven't played yet as I'm waiting for patches or pc ports. But Wukong is mine."

Positive,Best game in 2024 so far
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is a stunning fusion of the intense, stylish combat found in Devil May Cry with the atmospheric depth and challenging gameplay of Elden Ring. This game, which could be dubbed ‘Elden Monkey May Cry’, offers a breathtaking journey through a world steeped in Chinese mythology, where every battle is a test of skill and strategy. Wukong's combat is fast, fluid, and rewarding, demanding the precision of a seasoned warrior. The dark, immersive environments and rich storytelling make this a must-play for action RPG fans, delivering an experience that's both exhilarating and haunting—where the Monkey King may cry, but never smiles"
Positive,"this is my first souls like/god of war like game, what a game, its basically an 80 hour boss rush. loved it, some bosses are way harder than others, but i'm very under exposed to this type of game, this is clearly my skill issue, also i refused to skill into other stances, so this set me back, and ground out levels until i overpowered certain bosses.  i couldn't get enough of this game. it made me curious about the characters and found myself looking up stuff outside of the game to get context.this game is rich with Chinese folklore. i did receive this game as part of the NVIDIA promotion in exchange for my purchase of a video card, by no means was it ""free"" but i didn't purchase the game directly through steam. hope that satisfies your lawyers, steam."
Positive,rich storytelling insane graphics
Positive,"The only game where bosses can kill me with ""out of this world combo"" and i'm not even mad because it's cool as fk.10/10Would play again"
Positive,"The Unexpected Masterpiece!So, where do I start? After sinking over 106 hours into this gem (including an NG+ run because once clearly wasn’t enough), I have to say—this game is an absolute BANGER. Game Science has outdone itself, and I’ll be honest, AAA studios need to be taking notes. Enough with their Microtransactions and “Oops! You accidentally locked the real ending behind a $30 DLC purchase”—just give us a game, man!Every chapter in this game is like unwrapping a new present. The difficulty feels perfectly tailored to whatever mood you're in. Feeling invincible? Crank it up. Got emotional baggage? Maybe dial it back. It’s all there, and it’s all beautifully crafted.That said, I do have one gripe (because of course, nothing's perfect). Some areas feel like they came straight out of an empty void, devoid of anything interesting. I mean, if I’m trekking across the vast wastelands of this majestic world, the least you could do is give me a shiny trinket or a creepy lore tidbit to chew on. Nope, nada. Some places are so barren that you’d think they were reserved for some DLC, and let’s face it—they probably are.But hey, those moments aside, this game is an absolute treat. A contender for GOTY? I’d bet my level 100 character’s gear on it.This is a must-buy and must-play. Forget the negative reviews and the people crying about it. Play it for yourself, be your own judge, and enjoy the ride."
Positive,Had alot of fun. Some areas ran stale after a while and a map showing the outline of the map would go a long way for issues with navigation. Biggest issue for me is the input buffering when using items It will cost you a few runs. I have a few other gripes. But overall I enjoyed the game the bosses were fun for the most part. I would recommend it if you like fun and fast action game with SOME great bosses.
Positive,Art. A divine work of art. I haven't experienced beauty and passion like this since Okami. Those who are not familiar with Journey to the West or Chinese folklore in general may not appreciate the story as much. Gameplay elements from God of War and souls-like games.
Positive,very awesome game
Positive,I haven't played a single player story game in probably 7+ years.But this I cannot stop playing
Positive,monke see monke smash monke happy
Positive,"IGN : This game lack of diversity FUCK OFF DIVERSITY, I DONT NEED YOUR ASS LOVE STORY IN A GAME. DO YOU WANT THE SCENE WHERE GAY PEOPLE KISSING IN THIS GAME? DONT PLAY THIS GAME, THIS GAME ONLY FOR TRUE GAMER.I enjoyed being monkey beating bosses in this game, combat mechanic godly fun and so much to combo. NICE DEV GAME SCIENCE!!"
Positive,"This game is incredibly fun. The bosses are diverse and well designed.There are a lot of awesome looking armors to craft as well, my favorite being the Bull king set. Also there are plenty of different to builds to try and different ways to fight.This is definitely going to be GOTY."
Positive,"Such a beautiful game filled with so much lore ,never read Journey to the West but after finishing this, I'm going to read it now, I'd say it's not onpar with Elden Ring but just right under it when you compared to all souls games, just amazing  how much depth this game has take your time explore everything, the true and secret ending are fantastic"
Positive,"Some fights and mobs feel super annoying, like their hitbox, their skillsets or their movements and the game desperately requires a map for people who want to explore it fully without getting lost. These negative views, however, pale in comparison to how high quality this game is. Expansive skill tree & combat system, gear that aligns with different play style, great narration, animations, artwork and graphics. It is a fully (or at least 99%) polished game that does not even try to deliver you a social agenda, only a story. Which is something that can't be said about most recent games by ""TRIPLE A"" studios.Granted I'm only at chapter 3. IF they eventually start preaching grandstanding social politics, I'll let you know, but right now? The first chapter of the game was all I needed to write this review."
Positive,"The legend of Monkey King is my favorite tale since I was a kid. The journey of Sun Gokong, That's what I thought of his name when watching the series back then, and his comrades is always fun to follow. Since that, there's a lot of new ways to re-tell the myth of The Monkey King, one of them is come from a game developer based in the country where the tales first been told, China.Game Science introduce Black Myth: Wukong several years back, I forgot when was it but I believe somewhere in 2021. I was amaze how a game developer that the name I just heard developing game that usually come out from big developers. Now the game released with a huge explosion. Breaking some record in STEAM and destroying western game developer that I believe starting to run out creativity to produce enjoyable game. Maybe because they always think about money or maybe because disgusting agenda they always trying to sneak inside every game they make.So far I enjoy the game very much, despite I was not used to play a game like this but I make myself adapt to this game just because the mechanic is so addicting. The combat is great, the enemies is diverse, and the environment is mind blowing with a lot of secret waiting to be discovered. A bit disappointed when I realized that this game is not fully open world but that's okay, only sometimes too many invisible walls make me feels imprisoned in a beautiful paradise. Because with level design this great and you can't explore wherever you want is a bit let down right? The opening scene of this game is also brilliant, doesn't need that much time to introduce the mechanic until the game tittle showed up, packs with action and powerful cinematography, very efficient way to introduce a new game.There are indeed some bad side of this game like sometimes I feel like my button input a bit delayed, and some render was not perfect, but that was a minor issue. Overall, this far, I really enjoy the game. I can't talk about the story yet because I haven't finished it. So yeeah, I highly recommend this game. Let's not talk about GOTY yet shall we. Because as long as the western gaming enthusiast don't like it, it will be hard for this game to earned it."
Positive,This game is pure cinema  and perfection down to every last minute details. It would be robbery if this game does not get GOTY.
Positive,"I don't the game is so good that deserves a 96% on steam rating (higher than elden ring, sekiro, cyberpunk, etc) but the game is a lot better than all the garbage AAAs that are releasing. This is a good standard for AAA titles."
Positive,"Fck TGA, 2024GOTY goeeeeees for Black Myth Wukong!!!!The final chapter's boss, Erlang Shen, teaches the God of War:Ragnarok how to do boss fights!!!The first chapter was quite boring but after that were great, and 2d animations are awesome, GOTY FOR SURE.2024GOTY年度游戏预定，TGA你最好给我识相点！！！还有战神5能不能学学人家二郎神的BOSS战设计！！！"
Positive,"an incredible game, insane graphics, great gameplay, fun story and an all around tremendous game!higly reccomended if you like soulslikes! it takes a ton of inspiration from games like Lies of P wich i love and sekiro wich i love/hate. incredible game.although i have a few issues: there are a lot of sudden framedrops. and it will randomely go from a stable 90 to a bit framy 50 fps on my pretty highend rig. some textures on walls and such seem to have a hard time loading in, and has a low quality version sometimes. some of the gameplay feels very delayed. some actions just arent preformed because of other animations that are still ongoing. ive had many times where i needed to dodge, where it either just didnt happen because my character was at the end of an animation or it just didnt do it at all for some reason. same with healing and a few other stuff. you are rewarded for being agressive in this game, wich i love, but the controls arent responsive enough to be agressive. and lastly, there will be bosses that are just straight up annoying to fight. so far (for me) those have only been the sidebosses. thankfully the main bosses have been some of the best bosses in any game like this that ive ever tried. but these sidebosses will have very unfair linkups and attackchains and attaks that hurl a ton of stuff at you at once. the worst of them so far have been the the lightning frog. he hurls lighning projectiles in different forms at you, and while you are dodging the projectiles. at worst he can even grab you in your dodge away from his projectile attacks (it did this to me twice) definately the most rng relient boss ive ever faced.but in the end this is still just a few gripes. overall the gameplay and bosses have been incredible. they are definitely hard, but fair most of the time, i am really looking forward to play it again every time i stop! Absolutely incredible game!"
Positive,"im really enjoying the world building and gameplay. the controls take a bit to get used to, but with a boss around every corner, you're bound to learn them quickly. add on top of that the ability to quickly build up xp, even when you die 100 times, and you're well on your way to level 100 before you get to the last boss (very handy for a less experienced boss-rush player like me). this game is not as difficult as elden ring but still challenging given how many bosses/mini bosses there are. this is not an open world game, it's more linear like God of War; the storyline takes precedence (which i wanted to play the game for) but you do get rewarded for exploration and being curious. i played on PS5 controller connected to PC and it felt pretty good. to call the game beautifully done is an understatement, you can really tell the devs cared for the game. from the UI to the character designs, everything is rendered in a thoughtful and story-focused way immersing the player into the world of Wukong and a mythical ancient China. the introduction alone deserves high praise; it was simply stunning and streamlined. i also really loved the poetic script, i can imagine they sound more profound and philosophical in chinese but i enjoyed it nonetheless lol. one gripe i have: invisible walls. with the game looking so realistic, you feel like you can step or climb (also he's also a monkey, why can't he climb?), but the invisible wall kind of just hits you out of nowhere sometimes, even though the path or area ahead looks very walkable. wish there was a more creative way to keep the player away from unplayable areas. but this is a very small issue in an otherwise epic game."
Positive,Great game so far but WHY ARE THERE MISS-ABLE BOSSES. They give you a bunch of different paths to take and if you go a tiny bit too far then you will just straight up miss out on content. In the journal I now have permanent empty spaces in the indexes that are unfix-able for basically no reason. absolute bologna
Positive,No woke propaganda no any form political view just Monke great and awesome game. GOTY of 2024
Positive,"Reject modernity, embrace UGA MONKEH"
Positive,"An excellent action rpg game!  It's not a soulslike I would say.  you dont drop your ""souls"" and the enemies arent SUPER hard.  But its a great balance of beauty, fun and challenge!Apes Together Strong."
Positive,Exceeded my expectations for sure!
Positive,"To the Devs, Please remove 3rd-party DRM: Denuvo, this has historically caused hiccups in game performance, which this game is victim to."

Positive,Best game of 2024 so far
Positive,astonishing environment and memorable characters，best game I’ve played this year。
Positive,WHY YOU SHOULD SUPPORT THIS GAME• $80+ for 100+ hours of content + New Game+• Play as a OP MONKEY!• Also can play as 20+ different spirits.• Phenomenal graphics• Fantastic story• Incredible combat• Unique gameplay• Beautiful characters• So Diverse!• NO WOKE AGENDA!
Positive,"The intro, graphics, and performance of the game is good so far.The bosses are really hard.In order to reach the level to beat the bosses you have to repeat the same walkthrough over and over again by resting near shrine.Always use your healing potion wisely.Try to focus on increasing health and stamina core initially and stamina consumption at initial levels.Don't go for perfect dodge, keep dodging during boss fight and focus on quick attacks.Suggestions: Try to focus on increasing your health and stamina core at initial level and reach level 15 before facing first boss."
Positive,"Updating my previous review. THIS IS NOT A SOULSLIKE. That becomes more apparent the more you progress through the game. The game is fun. The combat is really well done, feels very fluid and there are a ton of unique abilities. Unlike Souls games, you can really develop a rhythm in the combat, you can dodge mid-attack so it's cool to keep attacking and throw in a dodge when you see the enemy is about to strike and then continue attacking. There's a stamina bar, but with upgrades, it doesn't feel like something you ever have to worry about unlike a Souls game. 90 bosses is crazy. The design of the characters is top notch and the bosses I've fought so far have all been an interesting and fun challenge to fight. Invisible walls are the games biggest downfall in my opinion. It's very common to see what looks like a purpose-built traversable area and as you approach it, you're abruptly stopped by an invisible wall. Shader compilation when entering new areas is a problem, like all Unreal Engine 5 games, but it does smooth out about 10-20 seconds after entering a new area. Graphics are great. I installed mods to clean up a lot of the post processing effects and it enhanced the visuals a lot. All in all, if you're looking for a fun but near Souls-level challenge in a hack and slash boss rush game akin to something like Devil May Cry, then this is for you. --Original review:Unfortunately the game does not run well on my setup. 4090, 13900k, 32gb 6400mhz DDR5. I can create terrible reproducible stutter when passing through areas or panning the camera over water.The game is also overly sharpened beyond belief, giving it a less than stellar look at max settings. Environments feel a bit like a UE5 tech demo. There's very obvious paths that you can follow and the sides of these paths are littered with invisible walls. If you're into games where you like to ask, ""I wonder what would happen if I go up there/do this,"" then this game isn't for you. What happens if you try to go up that cliff or down that ledge to what looks like an obvious traversable area? Nothing. You hit an invisible wall.The combat is fun and is a great showcase of good bossfights and character design, but it's got it's fair share of issues and how limited the game feels make it pretty obvious this is Game Science's first game."
Positive,good fighting and tiny weird man :)
Positive,"Gonna write a longer review later, but what I've played is excellent."
Positive,Game is great. Graphics are amazing and the boss fight dynamics is an interesting new mechanic.
Positive,Shut up and take my money!!!!!
Positive,10/10 Don’t listen to the critics awesome game we are lucky and blessed to play and experience this great game. Been waiting since I was born for a Wukong game.
Positive,"Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to their scope.In 1812, Étienne Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidae group of monkeys together and established the name Catarrhini, ""Old World monkeys"", (""singes de l'Ancien Monde"" in French).[3][4][5] The extant sister of the Catarrhini in the monkey (""singes"") group is the Platyrrhini (New World monkeys).[3] Some nine million years before the divergence between the Cercopithecidae and the apes,[6] the Platyrrhini emerged within ""monkeys"" by migration to South America from Afro-Arabia (the Old World),[citation needed][7][8] likely by ocean.[9][10][better source needed] Apes are thus deep in the tree of extant and extinct monkeys, and any of the apes is distinctly closer related to the Cercopithecidae than the Platyrrhini are.Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.Within suborder Haplorhini, the simians are a sister group to the tarsiers – the two members diverged some 70 million years ago.[11] New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians roughly 35 million years ago. Old World monkeys and apes emerged within the catarrhine monkeys about 25 million years ago. Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus (35–32 million years ago) are also considered monkeys by primatologists.[12][9][13][14][15][16]Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys, but strepsirrhine primates (suborder Strepsirrhini). The simians' sister group, the tarsiers, are also haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys.[citation needed]Apes emerged within monkeys as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. However, there has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, so ""Old World monkey"" may be taken to mean either the Cercopithecoidea (not including apes) or the Catarrhini (including apes).[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25] That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century.[26] Linnaeus placed this group in 1758 together with the tarsiers, in a single genus ""Simia"" (sans Homo), an ensemble now recognised as the Haplorhini.[27]Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers.[28][better source needed]Historical and modern terminologyThe Barbary macaque is also known as the Barbary ape.According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word ""monkey"" may originate in a German version of the Reynard the Fox fable, published c. 1580. In this version of the fable, a character named Moneke is the son of Martin the Ape.[29] In English, no clear distinction was originally made between ""ape"" and ""monkey""; thus the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica entry for ""ape"" notes that it is either a synonym for ""monkey"" or is used to mean a tailless humanlike primate.[30] Colloquially, the terms ""monkey"" and ""ape"" are widely used interchangeably.[31][32] Also, a few monkey species have the word ""ape"" in their common name, such as the Barbary ape.Later in the first half of the 20th century, the idea developed that there were trends in primate evolution and that the living members of the order could be arranged in a series, leading through ""monkeys"" and ""apes"" to humans.[33] Monkeys thus constituted a ""grade"" on the path to humans and were distinguished from ""apes"".Scientific classifications are now more often based on monophyletic groups, that is groups consisting of all the descendants of a common ancestor. The New World monkeys and the Old World monkeys are each monophyletic groups, but their combination was not, since it excluded hominoids (apes and humans). Thus, the term ""monkey"" no longer referred to a recognized scientific taxon. The smallest accepted taxon which contains all the monkeys is the infraorder Simiiformes, or simians. However this also contains the hominoids, so that monkeys are, in terms of currently recognized taxa, non-hominoid simians. Colloquially and pop-culturally, the term is ambiguous and sometimes monkey includes non-human hominoids.[34] In addition, frequent arguments are made for a monophyletic usage of the word ""monkey"" from the perspective that usage should reflect cladistics.[21][35][36][37][38]Several science-fiction and fantasy stories have depicted non-human (fantastical or alien) antagonistic characters refer to humans as monkeys, usually in a derogatory manner, as a form of metacommentary.[39]A group of monkeys may be commonly referred to as a tribe or a troop.[40]Two separate groups of primates are referred to as ""monkeys"": New World monkeys (platyrrhines) from South and Central America and Old World monkeys (catarrhines in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea) from Africa and Asia. Apes (hominoids)—consisting of gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos, and humans—are also catarrhines but were classically distinguished from monkeys.[41][9][42][43] Tailless monkeys may be called ""apes"", incorrectly according to modern usage; thus the tailless Barbary macaque is historically called the ""Barbary ape"".[32]DescriptionAs apes have emerged in the monkey group as sister of the old world monkeys, characteristics that describe monkeys are generally shared by apes as well. Williams et al. outlined evolutionary features, including in stem groupings, contrasted against the other primates such as the tarsiers and the lemuriformes.[44]Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 mm (4+5⁄8 in) with a 172 mm (6+3⁄4 in) tail and just over 100 g (3+1⁄2 oz) in weight,[45] to the male mandrill, almost 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long and weighing up to 36 kg (79 lb).[46] Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders).[47]Some characteristics are shared among the groups; most New World monkeys have long tails, with those in the Atelidae family being prehensile, while Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails or no visible tail at all.[32] Old World monkeys have trichromatic color vision like that of humans, while New World monkeys may be trichromatic, dichromatic, or—as in the owl monkeys and greater galagos—monochromatic. Although both the New and Old World monkeys, like the apes, have forward-facing eyes, the faces of Old World and New World monkeys look very different, though again, each group shares some features such as the types of noses, cheeks and rumps.[47]ClassificationThe following list shows where the various monkey families (bolded) are placed in the classification of living (extant) primates.Order PrimatesSuborder Strepsirrhini: lemurs, lorises, and galagosSuborder Haplorhini: tarsiers, monkeys, and apesInfraorder TarsiiformesFamily Tarsiidae: tarsiersInfraorder Simiiformes: simiansParvorder Platyrrhini: New World monkeysFamily Callitrichidae: marmosets and tamarins (42 species)Family Cebidae: capuchins and squirrel monkeys (14 species)Family Aotidae: night monkeys (11 species)Family Pitheciidae: titis, sakis, and uakaris (41 species)Family Atelidae: howler, spider, and woolly monkeys (24 species)Parvorder CatarrhiniSuperfamily CercopithecoideaFamily Ce"
Positive,Definitely what its hyped up to be the graphics are next level but i do wish their was a map as that would help a lot
Positive,"The game appears fluid, competent and well designed in a lot of respects, but by the time I hit the second boss, I was already pretty checked out. I might revisit this at a later date and put more time and energy to it. Performance has been rock solid on my PC and looks incredibly high quality.---Update: Issue appears to have been related to the Intel processor core clock speed.

Positive,Ig china isn't as greedy as japan
Positive,"No microtransactions, what a blessing in these times"
Positive,"I have not been this happy and satisfied playing a game since mid 2000s, back when I was still in high school when all I wanted was go back home, turn on my PS2, kick back and relax to enjoy that pristine, immaculate single player experience. A few hours in and I knew damn well that I'm gonna play the hell out of this game.Some of the final fights in this game are absolute CINEMA. If you can, try doing yourself a favor and avoid spoilers to experience them blind for the first time, especially so if you're familiar with the original mythology since it will enhance your enjoyment tremendously. This reason is probably also why I myself enjoy Black Myth this much; the story of Journey to the West was a huge part of my childhood. Seeing all the references and characters depicted in beautiful designs, on top of the banger gameplay, are simply indescribable."
Positive,GOTY ! ! ! !
Positive,"monkey is awesome, but has to save even more awesome monkey"
Positive,"Not into soul games, but this game rocks. Definetly had a moments to panic and thinking about giving up on some of the bosses. But just going back in the game, exploring a bit more, leveling up and trying again, was able to pass those bosses. The game is hard, but not impossible. The game is beautiful, the story is good, the gameplay is fun.Played exclusively on GeForceNow. I on Chapter 4 right now, level 80. I do suck at the game, but slowly getting there."
Positive,Just a epic game. My kind of game
Positive,Shut up and take my MONEY !
Positive,"Great game with good story and good game play. you can feel the time, effort, and love put into this. barely any bugs in my play through and if their were they were character models stuck there after a big boss fight nothing game breaking for me at least. combat is balanced to where you can have fun fighting mobs and feel rewarding if you pay attention to boss strings, every fight can be won in your own way just experiment with what feels right to you. each areas progression feels good for where you end up, never did a area make me under leveled, and with how much stuff is hidden in one area it is highly recommended you explore every nook and cranny of an area but not necessary in the slightest. voice acting sounds good both in Chinese and English, although the character you play as makes grunts and screams overall the destined one is mute throughout the game a little weird at first but you slowly get used to it during your journey. i know it sounds like i'm just gobbling this up by its taint but its just that good, worth the $60.00 price tag and any dlc that might follow suit."

Positive,"Very nice game, wish it give options to choose difficulty level though, im not very good with this type of game and prefer it to be easier- Update my review after 40 hours of play time... i changed my mind, the difficulty feels better after some play time and getting use to this type of game and control, the rewarding feeling after you finally win a fight with a harder boss is amazing!"
Positive,Should be GOTY
Positive,Love it. Can't beat most bosses or they take a long time to beat tho. My skill aint good
Positive,you have taught me to be monke猴大哥.. 我不小心弄坏了我的游戏控制器! 请教我少生气..
Positive,"It's fun to get a game that explores a different mythology setting than what you're used to. I highly recommend reading the Journey to the west books before playing this to understand the story a bit more, but if you have a hard time reading then there is a series on youtube that covers the story there. So heres my review:In a soulslike fashion it is a great experience though but long overdrawn segments of the later chapters can be boring, but exploration is a factor which balances that out since you can find so much. I really do love that exploration doesn't lack content. In the form of mini bosses, secrets, developing your character through pills you can find, meditation spots with beautiful visuals of the soroundings and filling up your journal with info about this worlds creatures you find on the journey. The game just fills most of the empty space in a big world. This makes me want more.I would give this game a 9/10 for the aesthetic. The visuals are just stunning. A 8/10 for the combat, you can seriously only do so much with what you get but still combine stances and do combos to a certain degree. A 10/10 for the progression system where you can literally respec if you want to try another build with so many abilities to choose from. And last but not lease i will give the overall story a 8.5/10. Keeping this spoiler free I will just say that I just like the characters and what they bring into the destined ones Journey throughout the game."
Positive,"first chapter is bland, but the others are REALLY good."
Positive,"Every lesser yaoguai has really unique lore, 10/10 for the details (chef's kiss)Wandering Wight can suck my ****"
Positive,"Good game for what its going for. I enjoyed playing the game a lot. Most of the bosses are diverse and fun except for the huge difficulty spike in the end (understandable as its the last few bosses).Graphics are good, gameplay is good.The only bad thing I noted include hitboxes: sometimes being wonky, and at times the animations outright doesnt align with the hitbox (e.g. lasers to the front of bosses hitting when you're directly perpendicular to the attach)."
Positive,"Awesome game. The graphics and the visual effects are beautiful. The game works great from day 1, no major bugs or crashes. I haven't had a single problem running this game. It also runs on the steam deck. Combat system, skills and magic are great. With upgrades it only gets better. With progression there's plenty more armour sets to unlock and weapons. There's a good bit of exploration to do and secrets to find. This game is GOTY material."
Positive,Simply amazing and fun. Nothing more or less. Just like games used to be.
Positive,HUHU AHAH HUHUHU AHAHAH  ME MOMGKEI HUHU AHAH
Positive,Great game just the story is a bit hard to undertsand
Positive,This game is PEAK! GOTY 2024 incoming!
Positive,"It's a great game. I couldn't enjoy dark souls because it was too hard. This game is a bit simpler, the spells def bridge the gap and allow the game to be playable for me."
Positive,Obvious comparisons to some Souls-like and newer God of War. But also found myself collecting souls like they were Pokemon. Gotta harvest them all.
Positive,"Get the game, stop thinking too much. It's good 👍🏻"
Positive,"This is the first review i have ever left for a game in my LIFE.I have struggled for years to play video games as I don't find them fun and entertaining enough to keep me engaged.I bought this game and played it as soon as it released, I have not put down the controller and almost 100% the game in just two days. THIS game made me feel like a kid again. 9.5/10.If optimization wasn't an issue this would be given a 10/10 EASY.GET THIS GAME YOU WONT REGRET IT!!"
Positive,"Between God of War and an souls like game, it's nice"
Positive,"Once you go BMW mechanics , theres no going back."
Positive,Nothing short of a masterpiece.
Positive,excellent game overall. my only small gripe about it is the tedious invisible walls around some of the areas. besides that i genuinely enjoy this game very much coming from games like Elden ring and wolong
Positive,"Game keeps crashing on my high end laptop,  was forced to play entire game on low settings, very shitty.The game itself is very very good, I was upset about the last boss being so easy and everyone talked it up about being so difficult. I don't feel like he should be 1 shot, act 4 boss Yellow Loong was much harder."
Positive,"Definitely a good game, but not without some flaws, such as the odd grab attacks that pull you out of the air or the strange collisions with some bosses. Not to mention the invisible walls that prevent you from progressing, rather than using obstacles like stones or other objects to block you. It feels a bit like corners were cut in these areas. However, apart from these issues, I really enjoyed the game, and the difficulty was engaging most of the time. The cutscenes were definitely top-notch, and the graphics are wonderful."
Positive,- 0 muscular wemen;- 0 SJW;- 0 microtransactions:- 100% optimized;- 100% satisfaction;- very affordable.10/10
Positive,Just play! Not that easy but not a souls like game. Pretty good lore with a lot of boss fights
Positive,"Fun to play. Bosses are not particularly difficult, but they require 2-3 attempts. Some minor bugs can be overlooked. Exploration can be somewhat overwhelming as there is no map in the game. I went through it up to chapter 3 and I am not sure if I will play further. The game's popularity appears to be exaggerated. This game brings nothing new to the table. Nonetheless, the game is recommended for its art, middling difficulty, and for bashing the West's Woke propaganda. I will rate this 7.5/10.EDIT: I finished the game and i admit that i was wrong. Definitely favorite game of this year. Updated Rating 9/10"
Positive,"Just beat the game and heres my reviewThis is not an easy hack and slash turn your brain off BUT it isnt as hard as souls games, a good starter if you're looking for a difficult game to get intoCombat is very enjoyable and the perfect dodges are so damn satisfying, don't listen to those on TikTok saying that it's clunky and how the heavy attack doesn't come out quickly. The heavy attack is more so a charged attack YOU HOLD THE BUTTON DOWNAs for performance i kept having random stutters here and there, framerate was fine tho got around 140-200 fps most of the timeAs for the bad things- Stutters ( could be an only me thing though )- Was confused on where to go on chapter 6- Hitboxes can suck alot, especially on bosses- Not enough bad things for me to think of an entire list at the moment"

Positive,"Man, this game made me go watch the original Show in Chinese. Bro in the show he one shoted Tiger Vanguard. My gameplay wasn`t as smooth as that 0.o"
Positive,not gonna lie this game is fireeeeee so into it ...having a blast
Positive,"In Chapter 3 so far. Very fun game, pretty well polished. Complete game on launch, no microtransactions. Triple  A quality. Great animations, great combat, great design.Chapter 1 is the worst chapter so far but that is just because each chapter has gotten better and better. Give it a shot."
Positive,GAME IS FREAKIN AWESOME
Positive,"Amazing combat, Amazing graphics = master piece"
Positive,"This game is so good that I decided to post my first feedback, and recommendation."
Positive,monkey goes bonkmonkey goes whooshmonkey goes swooshmasterpiece.
Positive,"A class, no kidding."
Positive,"screen rant said game lacked diversity and inclusiveness,clearly missed the point of the OG story about a talking monkey overcoming trials and tests resolve,the game is not a direct adaption of the source material or the story within the OG book.screen rant also said the games is Soulslike. But clearly fails to comprehend what the soulslike genre is about.Just because the game has a stamina system and shrines you can't call it a souls like game. Fornite has cars and driving in it? is it a racing like game then? its merely souls influenced."
Positive,"As a Chinese, it is impossible to objectively evaluate this game. There are always too many emotions that make a person in his forties too excited. But it seems like the system doesn't allow it to be sent out. I haven't played this type of game before, and so far in Chapter 3, I don't think the difficulty is too difficult to give up on. The graphics card is only 1650, but the entire process is basically smooth, except for some lag when converting animations. So don't worry about your level and configuration, just give it a try."
Positive,"Great graphics, great gameplay, no woke bullshit. Cant wait for the DLC."
Positive,Game of the Year. No contest. Any argument held is fake news.
Positive,monkey with big stick. 10/10
Positive,Great game 10/10 rip 4th sister and violet lady
Positive,"The game is simply perfect in every aspect, from the scenarios, environment and physics to the fighting mechanics, skills and abilities, the skill tree and character development is very extensive and dynamic, with the possibility of easily changing builds at any time. whatever you want, I have no words to describe how this game is delivering everything it promised, I'm currently in chapter 3 and following this journey, in terms of difficulty the game is not a souls like but it's also not an easy game in which you just move forward and hit without thinking, it has its level of difficulty and sometimes you spend hours to get past a boss, in terms of exploration, the game contains its main path but has a range of extensive places to be explored and discovered, chapter 1 specifically doesn't have many places to explore, but from then on you can spend a few hours trying to find all the secrets on the map hahahahahahaThis is my honest opinion about the game from someone who has been playing for almost 30 hours, I hope it helped"

Positive,Reject humanity - return to monke
Positive,"Beautiful scenes, wonderful music and excellent boss encounters. I'm excited for personal failure to finally feel greater reward for my time accomplishing victories. This game gives me that challenge I have not had in a good while. The play for me so far, for some reason, takes me back to my youth when games to me were challenging but in a healthy way. I'm totally invested with only 3 hours in and I absolutely appreciate what this game has given me so far.  Thank you Game Science!p.s. please do NOT ever add maps. haha...I absolutely love it!"
Positive,"The game looks amazing and you can see there was effort put into the game, but it is certainly a boss fighting simulator... You fight a boss, walk 30 seconds, and fight another boss. It doesn't feel rewarding and there's not much to explore. You don't lose anything on death and your level can only go up, so I guess the devs wanted to prevent farming by creating an empty map with few enemies... Your character doesn't talk and there isn't any ""build up"" to boss fights. Unlike other souls games where you fight a lot of enemies and earn your ""right"" to fight the boss, in Wukong you kind of just walk around and suddenly there's a boss. Still a great game, but their is a severe lack of environment and world building.Something pretty annoying about the game is the extreme amount of invisible walls. There are many places that look explorable, but when you take a long walk to it, it's just an invisible wall. The environment is also covered in invisible walls, so you don't have the freedom to walk on everything.Edit: It becomes a real game at chapter 3 and they fix most of the problems, the beginning is just lackluster."
Positive,"IGN's 8/10 is pure bullshit. This game is GOTY level 10/10.The only complains I have are: 1. some air walls don't make sense; 2. not perfectly optimized/micro stuttering during area loads; 3. lighting glitches when entering some caves.Everything else is perfect 10/10.In essence, this game is a mix of Sakiro and Elden Ring. You have the great combat experience (with a lot more cool moves) and a semi-linear level design of Sakiro, combined with the great visuals and boss designs of Elden Ring.Since it is not an open world, there is no meaningless horse riding, or repetitive side quests with formulated dialogues, or boring grinding. In fact, grinding in this game is pretty unless. If you can't beat a boss, 9/10 it's a skill issue."
Positive,"This game is so incredibly good, it's hard to even believe it. The combat is incredibly fun and finessed, and that's primarily what this game is, with some moderate secrets and exploration. However, the visuals this game presents are beyond anything I have encountered in a game. The between-chapter cutscenes are incredible works of art. Those masterful short-films combined with the gorgeous murals that wouldn't be out of place in a museum... it's breathtaking; and that's not to mention the graphics! Graphics aren't something I usually care too much about in games, but, the graphics in this case were stunningly beautiful. Lastly the sound design is wonderful, and the music wouldn't be out of place in any concert hall; truly fantastic. This game can be pretty difficult at times (especially the final boss!) but if I can beat it, anyone can do it. You owe it to yourself to buy and play this game, I think you will not regret it!"
Positive,"It's quite challenging and the fight is so smooth, monke goes brrrr"
Positive,VELI DE GOOD
Positive,"Monkey see, Monkey do."
Positive,"You saved me, why?Monke.Why?Monke. You have shown me monke.Monke. Mmm, monke.(this game is goty)Monke."
Positive,Big stick go brrrrrr
Positive,return to monke
Positive,"Playing on the Steam Deck OLED myself and it run Brilliantly, only two hours in so far having a blast!"
Positive,reject woke and return to monke
Positive,Great game but no HDR? cmon i get flash banged everytime the sun hits my character! goty for sure but cmon give us more tech!
Positive,fun good looking game with no woke crap in it at all
Positive,Doesn't have genders 12/10
Positive,"This game when it was first showed, looked like on of those never coming games because it just looked too good to be true.But after seeing that this game really is the thing that they has been showing along the years makes me so happy.This should be normal stand for Big games. make the game with passion love and time, Dont rush it out. These devs really did that and made a masterpiece of a Game.Definietly one of the best games in 2024 maybe even best of all time.This needs to be big GOTY contender !"
Positive,I recommend this game fully played a few hours and I'm insanely hooked to every one thinking this is souls like. This is more like a action game like DMC with light souls like added in. The graphics are 10/10 first game my PC can't fully handle im all here for this!
Positive,"Very Early Review just to say about how the game runs Specs :RTX 4080 Super 16GBRyrzen 9 7950x3d6000mhz RAM 32 gigsSTOCK SETTINGS (till now, no overclocking or undervolting)FPS 60-90 with DLSS and super resolution at arround 60-80% with super resolution at 100% that means DLAA and with Frame Generation ON goes to 68-75 FPSwithout it is like 90-100 FPSALL settings at cinematic and MAX 1440p Will update my review as soon as i get a more clear idea about the game just wanted to inform that it runs very smooth in the past 30 mins i played which is not so much just a few mobs in first area and a few cutscenes.Will also do a review in my youtube channel when i can about the gameI am going to Stream it on my twitch if you wanna come by to see it for yourself how it runs and in general you can find ithere : https://www.twitch.tv/giorgosyuki (my twitch, i have a link for my youtube channel there as well if you are interest)Will update the review as soon as i play moreTY for reading and i hope this one helps out there anyonePS Will make some benchmarks on my youtube channel soon as well apart from the streamingTy again for reading have a nice one !!"
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong is a beautiful game; it’s almost unbelievable how good this game looks, the colors and textures are amazing; the animations are wonderful; the boss animations are outstanding but the boss fights are difficult.Someone on the “Internets” said that this game was easy. I am not sure of that; most creatures that you find in the world are easy to kill but the boss fights, at least for someone like me who not usually plays this kind of game, are tough. I think I may have died 10 or 15 times just for the first mini(?) boss. The nice thing is that you can level up your character and try again; that’s how I did it. I still can’t pass the second boss. But I want to try again because I want to see the rest of the story, even it means I will to die hundreds of time; but I take it easy because I does get frustrating when you die constantly.I also bought this game to counter the “modern” requirements for games."
Positive,A masterpiece and a slap in the face to bias journalists and the inclusive cult. Good Job China
Positive,"this is how modern games should be made! no bullshit agenda, no forced stuff, just pure gorgeous gameplay and graphics.the only thing i wish it was improved on is the story, its not bad but they could have explained more."
Positive,"Good game, but whoever made the enemies, I truly they never sleep again."
Positive,I had to force myself to stop playing to go to work. GOTY 11/10
Positive,"Absolutely incredible game that shows that there are studios out there that want to make good games. This is their FIRST game. Truly an amazing labor of love. The entire game is a triumph. its absurd what happens when you prioritize talent and hard work over ""the message""./"
Positive,"The final boss is very creative, I've never seen a boss that can be so interactive.He will counter your skill and steal something from you when you need it.Suggestion: Either add mini-map or improve invisible wall with clear obstacle, I have to face banging each wall to find the secret path. :p"
Positive,"reject humanity, embrace monke!"
Positive,It's very emotional~
Positive,"you know in Elden Ring, you have a ton of cheap cheesy stuff that should make the game easier, but most bosses are immune to your cheap tricks? I mean what's the point of including it then? Well in Wukong, all the most dirty, vile, cheap moves that you can use work on all the bosses. Not only do they work, but sometimes the bosses even comment on what you're doing and you get unique dialogue. The game doesn't shame you for using your abilities, it encourages you. And that's just one of the reasons why this game is so damn fun."
Positive,"Wooooooooooooooooooooow!!!!!!!!!!!! One of the best Looking game I have ever played so far... ""Black Myth: Wukong dazzles with stunning visuals, fluid combat, and a captivating story. A must-play for action Souls like RPG fans."""
Positive,"The games art, atmosphere, level design and characters are phenomenal. These artists have truly accomplished something great with this game, the music is spot on, the bosses are fun, diverse and challenging. I'm so happy to see this game shatter steam records, I do wish there was a mini map or map of some sort lol. But hey if that's the most I have to complain about I'm sure I can deal with some champagne problems ;)"
Positive,"Is it 11/10 GOTY game? I dont think so. But it's fun nonetheless.Corridor-leveled action RPG with fun combat and limited, but functional, character progression and building. No complaints artistically, a nice change of pace from the stylised games I've been playing lately. I wouldnt say it is at a technical and artistic level of pathtraced C77, but it's nothing short of a nice to look at spectacle. Now whether this game is for you... it's not an open world, so if you come directly from ER you will feel claustrophobic. It's very limited in terms of itemisation (in comparison to any proper soulslike) as well - you build character with a skilltree first and foremost. This game offers mainly a fluid and sometimes challenging combat, very akin to DMC. If that's what you fancy, you'll be satisfied."
Positive,"From the moment I stepped into this mythological world, I was blown away by the sheer beauty of the landscapes and the intricacy of the character designs. Every moment feels like you’re playing through an epic legend, and the attention to detail is just insane.The combat? It’s a wild ride. Sure, it’s tough as nails, but that’s what makes every victory so satisfying. I found myself constantly challenged, and yet I kept coming back for more. It’s like the game is daring you to get better, and when you do, the sense of achievement is unmatched.But what really sets this game apart is the story. Rooted in Chinese mythology, it’s not just about swinging a staff and beating up mythical creatures. There’s depth here, a narrative that pulls you in and makes you want to uncover every secret. It’s like playing through a living, breathing piece of folklore.If you’re up for a challenge and want to experience a game that’s as beautiful as it is brutal, Black Myth: Wukong is a must-play. It’s easily one of the most memorable gaming experiences I’ve had in a long time. 10/10 would get humbled by monkey demons again"
Positive,"This game's a blast, smooth as a stream,Combat's tight—it’s like a dream!English dub's the way to go,Enemies talk, but subs don't show.Voice actors shine, they steal the scene,For gaming fun, this one's supreme!10/10 game in my book!"
Positive,Very cool graphics and game. Playing in full VR with UEVR injector - mind blowing. Only one thing : would be good to have R3 press button when out of combat to re-center the camera behind the player.
Positive,"I'm not a action game lover, nor im good at them. But Wukong still able to impress me with its visual and and boss fight. TBH, this is not ""best game I ever played"" material. But combined with solid game play, and some of the best visual currently available, I would definitely recommended this. Technical issue exist. Playing on 4070 and SSD, i have encountered many stuttering and loading issue just in the first two level, even in important cut scenes. Hope these issues could be fixed with new video driver and a launch patch."
Positive,"Wonderful and perfect game, no political correctness！！！It restores many characters and yaoguai from Chinese mythology, I played it smoothly, medium difficulty, challenging, and I was addicted to both the art style and the music."
Positive,Amazing game. Combat is flawless anime like animations and the game itself is just unlike any game I have played in the genre. The graphics are amongst the best out there I will recommend this game for a long time definitely has a chance at GOTY.I couldn’t recommend it enough everything about it like a breathe of fresh air. I know this company is new to the game but they knew what they were doing with this one
Positive,"Combat - So if i had to describe the combat in this game I would say it's like the newest God of war games but instead of being beefy kratos your a nimbal monke, and the spells are more unique. I personalty find it quite funVisuals - I got it on the lowest settings and the game still looks nice Bosses - Done a few bosses as of now, some are some what a challenge and some are quite easy even first tryed a few so if you have played a action rpg before you should be fineeeeeeeeee. it does have a lot of bosses so if you enjoy that its hereStory - getting there will say about that once i beat itbugs - seen a few visual bugs nothing big"
Positive,"Just finished the first chapter of the game after 4 hours. The game is phenomenal so far. It gives those old epic feelings that God of War and other PS 2/3 games had. The fighting is something to get used to but once you have the grip of it, it feels smooth and is a lot of fun. The game is definitely easier than souls games but nonetheless has its tricky parts so far. I would absolutely recommend the game if you enjoy games such as Dark Souls and God of War. The lore seems deeper than most souls like titles. The cut scenes  at the end of a chapter is unique and has quite the charm. I would give this game a 9 out of 10 so far and would absolutely recommend it to any souls games fan. Enjoy the fights and the weirdness of it all!"
Positive,"Game looks phenomenalGameplay is fun and engaging, some bosses are quite challengingOptimization is great, High settings are accessible to all current GPU while Cinematic Settings + Full Ray Tracing is for future hardwaresGame of the Year for sure"
Positive,BEST GAME I PLAYED THIS YEAR
Positive,Very good cinematics and gameplay. Worth the Price!
Positive,Awesome game. Really ahead of others in terms of action and story.
Positive,Super Saiyan requires cultivation
Positive,MOnkey died monkey sad MONKEy STAFF monkey Happy
Positive,Hmm...M O N K E Y
Positive,"Beautiful game waited years for this to come out, i like ancient chinese dynasty games this delivers everything that i hoped for and more. added on extra points for using keyboard and mouse my hands hurt but it was worth it.ps: please add keyboard and mouse keybind swapping"
Positive,"Black Myth Wu Kong is a visual spectacle with some great kinetic combat.  For an early version of Unreal Engine 5 game, it runs really well. It however let me down in multiple instances with some horrible boss fights which completely breaks the core design of the game's combat. I had to use guides to basically find to defeat obscure optional bosses in order to make the fights seem more 'fair' and which respects the game's system.I wish the story was presented in a more simpler terms because if you aren't familiar with the Journey to the West, it will be very hard to follow. It is a great first outing for the Chinese developer in this AAA space, If they learn from their mistakes then their next game will be a GOTY contender for sure.Update: True ending improved my opinion about the game, +1. It is hard to achieve it, but it is well worth it!9/10"
Positive,i good talk english. good very game
Positive,Make Moneys great again!
Positive,"Great game but 200,000 reviews in 24 hours???Review bots galore. Gotta love the Chinese."
Positive,"This is probably the best game I've ever played. From the graphics to the gameplay, everything is meticulously designed with many delightful details. There are numerous hidden bosses and items. The use of classical Chinese text is very elegant, and the game's background story inspired by ""Journey to the West,"" along with Chinese historical architecture, adds a lot of charm to it. Highly recommended."
Positive,Excellent game with beautiful graphics and solid gameplay. No microtransactions or other pay-2-not-play strings attached. Solid candidate for GotY
Positive,Love this game
Positive,amazing game def goty worthy
Positive,i am monke
Positive,OTW GOTY 2024
Positive,"I have fell in love with this game. The game's atmosphere, ambient music, and overall feel hooked me immediately. The game is extremely immersive right from the get go and never stops feeling that way. I also like the combat and the challenge the game presents, I very much recommend this game to those that like action/adventure, souls-like, and immersion."
Positive,Pros+Combat is fluid and fun+Cinematography can be breathtaking at times+Great diversity in items and merchanicsPros+Game performance is polished+Posses inclusivity and diversity+Gameplay doesn't become repetitive over time
Positive,This game is awesome -- it is very punishing.  I would say even more difficult than Lies of P but slightly less difficult than Shadow of the Erdtree.  It's kind of in a sweet spot.  There are no summons so you have no one else to blame other than yourself.  Full recommend if you are into the Souls games.
Positive,"Not my GoTY, but it's still a decent game.Pros:- Very woke game, you play as a DEI hire monkey-furry against a group of racist oligarchal non-monkeys- Gameplay is intuitive- Skill trees similar to sekiro/DMC/NioH- Plenty to explore (lots of hidden areas)- After the game has finished loading, exploration is seamless- The original voice acting syncs amazing to the language (playing in chinese)- Learning boss patterns is very rewarding (think Nioh/DMC/GoW in terms of how combat works)- There are basic attacks, special attacks, monkey magic, spirits, transformations, and support abilities- If you have a baby or a busy life, you can pause the game and not have to set distraction-free time - Gorgeous hand drawn yao guai entries- Beautiful cutscenes after chaptersCons:- Spam light attack to win, add a heavy attack when you have a focus point...- Some boss fights like captain wise voice were just boring/monotonous.- Some stuttering here and there, (I'm not playing on a God-mode machine)- Mouths don't sync up if not in chinese... This is 2024, we've solved the multiple language lip sync problem. Devs need to catch up.- Invisible walls everywhere. Hard to gauge where you can and can't go- Story is more of a ""devs did whatever they wanted"" thing that pays homage- The community is VERY xenophobic, trying to discuss the game without anti china or anti ""westerner"" comments from a jerk is hard to do"
Positive,"It feels boss rush at times but damn the game is really well made, needs some optimization but defo worth the money."
Positive,"Excellent game, very impressive visuals, fun challenging gameplay, and the story line is well crafted."
Positive,based monke game
Positive,"About a week ago I didn't even believe this game was real, but I'm glad it exists because it's so good. From its very responsive combat to its incredible art that is sometimes breathtaking, this game exceeds all my expectations.For me personally, this game is amazing with its artistic design, which you can see not just talking about the graphics, but the enemy design, the variety of levels and I swear I would love an expansion version of the animations between chapters, beatiful stuff.Yeah, it doesn't do anything really original, but it's very well executed.However, it's not a perfect game because of its level design, wich isn't all bad, but sometimes you can see problems like chapter three and six where sometimes you get lost because the level design gives you a lot of similarity and no clarity about wich path you already taken and where you should go, there is room for improvement, I believe that a map maybe could really help especially in the chapter 6, but I understood why not have it.That said, an incredible game and one of the best of the year! A must-play game."
Positive,monkey rash new meta
Positive,"There's some weirdness that surrounds the discourse about this game, I'm not Chinese nor am I someone who has any kind of agenda in making you think this game is the greatest thing to ever grace the earth. I 100%ed the game and I would like to tell you what it's like.There's a lot of back and forth with Soulslike comparisons and I would definitely say that it shares the better part of its DNA with the Soulsborne games. Checkpoints that refill your limited use healing item and respawn enemies, lots of showing and not very much telling with the story, a lack of difficulty options, what feels a total ambivalence on the game's part as to whether or not you see much of the content, and an often darker tone (despite some silly characters). It has the soul core system from Nioh, so the large majority of enemies have a transformation attack you can learn. It's not a soulslike per se, and indeed it lacks any meaningful punishment for death besides wasting some of your time, but it does have many elements from those games.The meat and potatoes of the game is the boss fights, there's like 81 or so, a few are repeats with an adjusted moveset but the variety here is honestly very impressive. The bosses themselves are very often easy enough to beat on your first try but a few are hard enough to be a true sweat, but these are almost always optional. It's not exactly a boss rush, despite many describing it that way. I think it can feel like one occasionally where the distance between boss fights can be measured in seconds at times, but more often there's just as much running around fighting normal enemies. Overall somewhere between a third and a half of your time playing will be fighting bosses, which is good because that's the best part of the game.The combat is tough to draw a single meaningful comparison to. There's a standard action-game dodge that you can do up to three times in a row, dodging with perfect timing gives a special animation and can proc certain effects. The main combat loop is dealing relatively minor damage with your light attacks to build up focus so you can cash it out with a big heavy attack that chunks the bosses' health. It's not Nioh, it's not Souls, it's not Bayonetta, it's not DMC, it's not God of War. It's something else almost entirely. There's also some abilities (4 at a time can be equipped plus a special active item and the aforementioned Soul Cores from Nioh). These abilities are strong and most of them require mana which, outside of some special interactions, can only be recovered at resting sites. So the main game loop is the light attacking to be able to cash out for a strong heavy but these abilities give you some extra utility to help you do that. There aren't a whole lot if you exclude the transformations, but there's some options.I did my research and read one of the popular English translations of Journey to the West before playing the game, and outside of recognizing some things and doing the Leo DiCaprio meme where I notice that thing from the book, it doesn't help as much as you would think. The game takes place AFTER the book, which is very much a happy ending, so they have to undo some character growth from Wukong and make him renounce the whole divine thing outright, and then heaven decides to kill him because they think they can do better this time (After Wukong crashes heaven in the book the first time nobody can kill him despite several methods of execution, they literally had to call the Buddha himself and he just trapped him.) Point is, the plot is predicated on Game Science's fanfic ending where Wukong gives up on Buddhahood and heaven somehow actually kills him. It's also clear that the creative liberties don't just start at the end of the book, as there's a few things I saw that don't really make sense with what happens in the book without some explanation. There's some creative liberties being taken here and that's okay but don't feel like you need to know the book before playing because honestly they are so firmly in fanfiction-land that it doesn't even matter anyway. The plot itself is pretty underwhelming honestly, but that doesn't make it any less fun to go though because the special cinematics at the end of each chapter are great and the spectacle of everything is always fun even if the plot behind it is weak.My one complaint is that invisible walls are pretty aggressive in many areas and the level design is definitely questionable sometimes, but overall I really enjoyed my time with the game. I don't normally bother to 100% a game but this one I did so that says something I think. Fun boss fights and a ton of them, very accessible difficulty for the vast majority of required fights, many cool moments, lots of hidden secrets, and rewarding progression on the journey (to the west)."
Positive,"Normally I am not a great fan of Souls like cause I am just a casual gamer. I cant say this one is easier cause I wipe a lot on most of the bosses but the ambient, fight mechanics and the story carry me a lot. So I really love this game so far."
Positive,"I see Monke game, I buy.I download game, very happy.I see Monke on screen, very nice.Monke sees Gods, Monke angry.Monke jumps, Rides cloud.Monke go full Monke, 3 eyes BTS guy come down.Monke and BTS fight, Monke be dante.Monke beats BTS guy ass, BTS guy cheat.Monke says come forest we fight, K pop guy follows.Monke has PTSD and Monke returns to Monke.Game starts with New Monke trying to find the OG Monke.10/10 GOTY"
Positive,"Love It, running pretty decent on steam deck;  My best game of the year beside Elden Ring DLC"
Positive,Good game! Also game journalist hate it so all the more reason to buy it!
Positive,The game is super visually stunning with Chinese traditional stories interpreted in a friendly way. Overall it is definitely a 10/10 for someone who wanna gain some cinematic gaming experience.
Positive,God damn.... this is a bloody good game.
Positive,"runs surprisingly well on a 3070, also one of the few times when a game looks exactly as good as the trailers depicted."
Positive,"Reject DEI, embrace Monke"
Positive,"Guys, I hate to break it to you, but George escaped again... It's just... well, you know how it is—monkey see, monkey do, and now he's off wielding a magical staff and battling ancient deities. Let me know if you see him! He's quite curious.- The Man in the Yellow Hat"
Positive,"Pro:1. Enemies' background stories are very interesting2. Many mini boss fights, all with unique styles3. Not Souls game level difficulty. No death penalty. Boss fights are easy if you are a Souls game player.4. Scenes are pretty. Cons:1. Need a good knowledge on ""Journey to the West"" to fully appreciate the game. The original Chinese texts are very difficult to translate, especially to European languages. I play in Chinese and I keep thinking there is no way to translate these words and still remain interesting.2. The fighting do not feel as satisfying as other souls games like Sekiro.3. No map and a lot of air walls. And a lot of contents are hidden in the map. So I had to spend a lot time on trying out every corners."
Positive,GAME OF THE YEAR!
Positive,"good, souls like game"
Positive,The game has made its journey to the west
Positive,ice lake dragon and pagoda realm section is the worst 2 hours i have ever played
Positive,First impressions- 9/10. Extremely beautiful game. Full widdescreen support. Not 10/10 because missing free roam possibilities of Elden Ring and map. Dynamic and polished combat system. Recommend it.
Positive,Man! What can I say! WU'KONG NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Positive,"First Impressions:-I have a 4080/7800x3d/64gb DDR5, runs fine for me, as it should.-Graphics are among the best of the best. -Intro sequence was absolutely bonkers-I tried the English dub, couldn't do it, not after hearing the Chinese VO. Obviously, I don't speak Chinese, so enabled subtitles. I like the native VO. -Controls are pretty straightforward-Consider me immersed.-Despite this being called an Action RPG it is no such thing. It is a boss rush, 100%. Minus 2 points for that. If this was an open world with population centers and whatnot, I  would give it a 10/10.8/10."
Positive,"Stunning Graphics: Black Myth: Wukong delivers a visual feast, boasting some of the most breathtaking graphics in gaming. From the intricate character designs to the lush, immersive environments, every scene feels like a work of art.Unique Storytelling:The game offers a refreshing take on the classic ""Journey to the West"" tale, presenting a narrative that feels both familiar and entirely new. It’s a deep dive into Eastern mythology that’s as compelling as it is original.Engaging Gameplay: The combat system is a standout, blending fluid martial arts with magical abilities, creating battles that are as strategic as they are exhilarating. Each encounter feels rewarding, making you want to push further into the adventure.Cons:Game Crashing Bugs: Unfortunately, Black Myth: Wukong suffers from some technical issues. Occasional game crashes can break immersion and disrupt the flow, which can be frustrating during critical moments.No Map: The lack of a map can lead to some disorientation, especially in more complex areas. While the game encourages exploration, not having a way to easily navigate can make getting lost a frequent and sometimes annoying experience.Verdict:Black Myth: Wukong is a mesmerizing journey through a beautifully realized world steeped in Eastern mythology. Its stunning visuals and innovative storytelling are only enhanced by its dynamic gameplay. However, the experience is slightly marred by technical hiccups and the absence of a map, which may frustrate some players. Despite these issues, it’s a must-play for anyone interested in mythological epics or action-packed adventures. If the developers can smooth out the bugs, this could be a classic in the making."
Positive,"Absolutely loved the game. the secret ending is the true ending. If you finished the game you can still access it by continuing the game instead of new journey, This is kind of a souls like but not a souls like at the same time, the graphics absolute menace for that alone you may wanna get this game by the way the developers used low res textures in lot of areas like the second chapter which really breaks the whole realism thing but apart from that I am pretty satisfied also if you are someone who is struggling to run the game, try not to push settings to the max as this game is very demanding yet on mix of high/very high and medium settings it runs pretty good and yeah RTX has a huge impact on the performance specially very high. I am overall satisfied and would definitely recommend the game. by the way it took me around 30ish hours to beat the game."
Positive,"I'm about 5 hours in and i have to say this is the biggest waste of $60 I've ever spent on a video game. the fighting mechanics are absolutely terrible. all your doing for the fights is dodging, getting a few hits in, dodging, getting a few in, then the boss becomes stronger faster and has a few different attacks but its the same dodge, hit, dodge, hit for about 25 minutes. there is no blocking, none, zero, your just jumping all game. the AI can attack through your attacks no matter what. the distance the enemy can cover is horrendous compared to the distance you can dodge. after the boss fights, you fight a few smaller guys, and then you encounter another boss fight. the story is absolutely non existent. from what I've gathered, you're monkey warrior going to find some rocks to bring back some dude who you used for 10 minutes in the pre-game.....that's the story right there. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be like Elden ring or what but the fighting mechanics, i cannot stress enough, are terrible. to the point where its un-playable and just not enjoyable....one bit. maybe this isn't just my type of game and if it isn't....I'm gladOk so about 16 hours in total and i was frustrated in my first review. i was used to the usual hack n slash mash x button and just be here for the story line but this game delivers a little more then that. IF / WHEN you beat a boss it actually feels like you've accomplished something. the fighting mechanics are still horrendous in my eyes, but it makes you play differently and its growing on me. strategy in a must, map exploration is a must, thinking is a must. i took this as another assassins creed or god of war type fighting game where you can muscle your way through anything and this game is just not that. Still unimpressed with the story line itself but the cinematic along the way kind of cover that up. changing my original review from thumbs down to up....would give it a 8.5/10 so far. really hoping the story line emerges or at least wakes up,maybe even some type of antagonist, but i need some thing to get me invested emotionally in this game as that is the main reason i personally play single player games. right now im still invested in the game but more so for the tougher boss fights and graphics / cinemas."
Positive,this is just a game of a Japanese television drama based on the 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West by Wu Cheng'en.
Positive,"Great game. Has a TON of hidden content as well. No microtransactions, no requirement to be online, just a good game."
Positive,"I will preface this by saying that I have played very many RPGs over the years. My favorites are Elden Ring, Witcher 3, Dishonored 1 & 2, Lies of P, Hitman WoA trilogy. Many more that I've loved. I had zero expectations for this one, as I don't really watch trailers or reveals much in development, because I've been disappointed many times before, and I'd rather go in blindly for my first experience.Also, as someone who doesn't know much about the original JTTW, this was an extra special first-time experience for me. From the intro alone, I immediately became hooked and could not wait to see what else the game had in store. The depiction of Sun Wukong is my favorite that I've seen. They did a very good job at telling his story even for people who don't know the history very well and may not know how to follow some things that were happening. The gameplay itself was super enjoyable, very fun combat for me. The stance changes are all fluid, the mechanics are fun and not too difficult to grasp. The boss fights were basically ALL memorable, and I enjoyed looking into the original Myth writings to understand more why some were designed the way that they were. There is good balance between fun and difficult fights, and also fights that are more for the experience. As someone who normally has a bad sense of direction and struggles to navigate and remember things in games, even with a map, the fact that I found my way throughout every chapter and 100% completed the game without a guide for almost everything other than some curios that were enemy drops I didn't know about, is a testament to very impressive map design. I could tell how much effort went into this game, and that the people who made it are people who are passionate. They love gaming, and they love the story they've told. I enjoyed every single second of this journey. From the combat, to the exploration, to the quests, the dialogue, the animations, the artwork, the music, the cutscenes, finding the hidden things, that rewarding feeling after figuring things out on my own, after beating some particular bosses that gave me a difficult, yet fun time... I cannot rave about this game enough. It feels like more than a game, but a very good depiction of a story. I love our little, young monkey. Our Destined One, and meeting Sun Wukong's friends he journeyed with. What a wonderful story you've told, and the way you've designed it is incredible, especially being a newer, and small development team. Bravo, Game Science. I hope that there is more for Black Myth: Wukong, by way of DLC, but I continue to keep playing again and again because the experience is just that breathtaking to me. I am not a person who looks for minor grievances in a game and nitpicks those, even if there are any. I take games for what they are, and this felt like more than just a game. So many moments are unforgettable for me. I laughed, I cried, I had that sort of empty feeling when I completed everything. Definitely now one of my very favorite games of all time. I truly want to say it is a 10/10 in my eyes. Go get your deserved GOTY."

Positive,"Just hit act 2 its a banger, the dev trolled youtubers and games media in general the dev said just have fun and it is indeed ""fun"" and it gets difficult.every act gets its own bestiary and they all get dialogue ingame especially the general tier units every chapter has its own units and enviromental story telling through them its very good paragraphs of lore too super interesting lore/mythology its not a retelling of the Chinese books, its like a follow up story. i was able to follow it without knowing the source materiel.its takeing all the good ideas from other games like nioh[stances/skill trees] and jade empire[transformations/surprising world building] and just injecting it into a fairly good product, if the game has 5 chapters like i think it does im in for a treat.had 0 expectations for this game untill i got to act 2 and i was hooked. its my kinda gamemy main gripe is lack of weapon diversity iv only found a spear so far and no map for these farly large open areas. still i am suprised by the story and boss diversity this game is more like sekiro then a regular dark souls clone, so much environmental story telling.also iv heard reports that the game is very hard but you didn't hear it from me. half the stance combos are locked behind skills also alot of health recovery comes from learned talents and damage avoidance skill too.the leveling is similar to devil may cry or dantes inferno like locking combos behind talents and even mobility skill like air dodges behind talents it just feel so similar just displayed differently this really is a mishmash of a game."

Positive,Game of the Decade!! Spent 6 thousand dollars buying a gaming PC just to play this game on my 80 inch TV with best graphic settings and it's worth it!!
Positive,This game has brought a new cultural mythology to my interest and just overall beautiful!!
Positive,Excellent Game! GOTY IN MY BOOK
Positive,Its worth it. Next level of gaming! :) I just completed it even. I would say this game is the next stage of gaming! I really mean it.
Positive,"practice practice practice. a freaking fun game with good lore and combat system. the graphics are amazing . the grinding for materials and levels are painful, the mind is addicted to this game that i have played non stop from 4pm till the next day 8am. It's my game of the year for me"
Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong is wild! The boss fights are next level—super tough but so worth it. The combat is smooth, and the world looks amazing. Every fight feels different, and the visuals are just crazy. If you love challenging games with sick graphics, you gotta check this one out!-----------GAME OF THE YEAR------------"
Positive,"This game wakes up every single cell in this middle-aged man. Watching the trailer gave me goose bumps. Now Game Science delivered on their promise. Everything is well crafted and does justice to the ancient lore that every Chinese grow up with.The attention to details is awesome. I stop by and appreciate the statues and murals - they are not random creations by artists. Almost all of them have a source, either from a book, a lore, or modeled after statues in ancient temples in remote rural area in China."

Positive,Imagine you being a monkey playing dark soulsThat's what you'll feel after you die 35 times for the same dumb boss.yes i recomend this 10/10
Positive,"Fantastic game!The graphics are gorgeous, and the character, world, and boss designs are amazing—both visually and in terms of gameplay. The combat feels smooth; it's less like Dark Souls than expected and more reminiscent of NieR, but still incredibly enjoyable."
Positive,"Finished my first play through at just over 50 hours (True Ending). This game is legendary and will likely be remembered for years to come. All six chapters were beautiful, challenging and an absolute joy to complete. By the end, you'll be looking forward to playing again in NG+, I guarantee it. GOTY!!!"
Positive,"I watched the 1986 Journey to the West show before playing so running through chapter 1 was nice seeing all those assholes and getting to fight them.  (Black Bear and that Kasaya stealing punk)(Big ass Buddha Baby was a great intro fight too)Got to chapter 2 and fought a big ass rock monster boss and died when he had a pixel of health left. . .Went back after awhile only to see another rock with heads on it, saw an interact button on it so i hit (RT) and another big ass rock monster popped up with a health bar. 2 Rocks 1 MonkeWe jumped the original big ass rock monster and he turned on me and i killed him with a sliver of health left.Currently fighting a Dragon with lightning maracas and he is beating his music into me. 10/10Not a souls game or a DMC game so don't go in expecting anything like that.Think of it like the old God Of War games with a lot of bosses and instead of getting new weapons you get staff stances (Heavy Attack) and Spells/Transformations to tune your setup.I'm enjoying the fuck out this game, good job Game Science.China Numba One"
Positive,Goty of the year
Positive,"Finally, a game us hairy men can relate to. DEI done right."

Positive,This is my personal GOTY for 2024. Everything it does is simply good. I have no complaints. All i can really say is I hope we have a expansion or sequel in the future. This game is just so fun. Constantly I find myself coming back to play it more and more.

Positive,God of War + Horizon Zero Dawn + Souls like. Perfect.
Positive,"I'm obviously not very far into this game, 0.7 hours, but I felt like I had a few things to say early, and I have watched others play the game. This game is VERY good, and very worth playing once the technical issues are ironed out.This game, doesn't feel like a Soulslike, I don't really get why people are calling this game a Soulslike, other than that they literally have not played action adventure games from before Dark Souls came out, and don't remember that many so-called Soulslike hallmarks are actually things in other action games, like the attack and dodge while locked on combat style is a thing in 3D Zelda games, does this mean Ocarina of Time is some sort of proto-soulslike?Hell no. Not every game is a soulslike, Ghost of Tsushima isn't a soulslike but frequently gets called one because ""it's combat feels similar"", despite the combat in that game being very different than any soulslike I've ever played. The combat of this game is more reminiscent of a much faster Ghost of Tsushima than anything for me, I've heard some people make Nioh comparisons but that's not really accurate, the game has a stance system but they don't feel anywhere the same as in Nioh. If anything, I'd compare the stances more to DMC's style system, or the Yakuza styles.This game doesn't have a soul system, instead having a regular level system, but you don't really feel restricted without leveling rewards, your moveset feels complete from the start. I didn't really feel like my starting kit had major holes in it, unlike a DMC game. The heavy attack feels strange at first until you realize the focus pellets massively speed it up, and with focus, it's actually quite fast, and gains armor with an early game perk.This game is not without flaws. Navigation does suck, this game could actually benefit from a map, a vague wisp isn't really enough direction since the areas are wide similar to Farron Keep, or Shaded Woods in the Dark Souls games. Except with invisible walls instead of actual walls. See, this game could've benefited from the Kingdoms of Amalur or Tales of Arise world design of just, filling the borders of the regions with mountains, and making it look like a weird snaky canyon world.Technical performance is also questionable, not sure exactly what the framerate is since the Nvidia App is broken if you have a large game library, which is on me for not using a better framerate monitor. But I felt framerate fluctuations and also the framepacing was pretty clearly not right. I don't need to use Special K to tell you the framepacing graph probably looked like a sawtooth wave. Still, this is a very fun game, and will probably be remembered to some extent, and certainly financially performed great for a first time AAA release from a new studio.The game's plot, is pretty on-point with what you'd expect from a dark and gritty adaptation of Journey To The West. I'm somewhat familiar with the tale already, but if you aren't, it's a fantastic book and also quite long, about twice the length of Lord of the Rings, no that isn't a joke, I haven't finished reading it for obvious reasons. This game doesn't really have a message outside of that which the original story has, from what I've seen. Contrary to what people seem to be debating about around this game, it's very not concerned about ideology outside that which is discussed by the original novel, and even then the game is more in favor of focusing on the presentation and gameplay.I'd personally suggest waiting for patches, but there's no gamebreaking issues, just general poor optimization.EDIT: FSR Frame-Gen is a godsend here."

Positive,"Although not a super challenging game so far (sure, some bosses take some getting used to), the combat and the boss fights feel really epic. Disregard the controversy, its a bunch of nonsense. Remember Hogwarts: Legacy? Make a good game, people will play it. The world, the character designs, the different mechanics the game introduces, all feel pretty unique and give this genre a breadth of fresh air. At launch, 1.4 million concurrent players, says a lot. Thumbs up from me."

Positive,"Black Myth: Wukong captivates with its stunning art direction, drawing deeply from Chinese mythology to create a visually rich world. The environments are meticulously detailed, and the character designs are both traditional and fresh, making every scene a feast for the eyes. Combat in ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is equally impressive, offering fluid and responsive gameplay that feels incredibly satisfying. The variety of moves and abilities keeps each battle dynamic and engaging, allowing for diverse playstyles. Overall, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" excels in both visuals and combat, making it a must-play for fans of immersive action games."

Positive,reject LGTV return to MONKE10/10
Positive,"I'm already on my second play-through, and I'm really hooked on this game.From a game play perspective, the boss battles are thrilling, and the combat system offers a lot of variety. Plus, the game is set against a legendary backdrop inspired by Eastern mythology, which adds to its unique charm.The bosses aren't as hardcore as those in Souls-like games; they offer a good challenge without feeling overly punishing. The game allows me to focus on every move a boss makes and respond accordingly, and that kind of immersive satisfaction is rare. Of course, the adrenaline rush after overcoming a tough challenge is incredibly rewarding!That said, there are a few issues worth mentioning:1. On both my desktop with a 3060ti GPU and another laptop with a 3070, I experienced flickering vegetation graphics. Even after updating to the latest drivers, the problem persisted.2. There were occasional frame drops and stuttering, even during the end credits after beating the game, which was quite baffling.3. The lack of a mini-map can be understood as a deliberate choice by the developers to encourage players to fully immerse themselves in the game world. However, after Chapter 3, consulting online maps on forums becomes almost necessary.4. While the boss fight in Chapter 6 is fantastic, the accompanying map design feels rather rushed and underdeveloped.Overall, despite its flaws, the game is still a joy to play!"
Positive,Where I can bet that this game will be Game of the YEAR???? I will put all my money on it! Thank you Devs! You did outstanding job!!!!!!!
Positive,A game about Journey to the West is something i've been wanting for all of my life. It's also very beautiful and gamplay is fun.P.S. Thank you for not yielding to woke culture and extortionists. Embrace Monke
Positive,Do you recommend this game? Yes
Positive,"fun game play great graphicspisses of ""game"" journalists 10/10"
Positive,7.5吧 地图至少扣两分  其他方面细节做的很不错了对于第一个游戏来说
Positive,"Black Myth Wukong - looks Gorgeous! There's so much love put in it!I Didn't knew what to expect when first playing but when i started, the game reminded me alot of NIOH2.it was Definately not Elden Ring.The fighting style, the same checkpoint thingies, the special abilities from monsters and the skill systems are NIOH2 like.I don't play on high end pc and it runs smooth and still i see the game in it's glory, gameplay is amazing, the battles are fluid the combos are rewarding if you make them right, the music is lovely, alot of good cutscenes, highly recommended. The bosses feels great, they are alive - one cries when you beat it, the other licks his wounds and so on... - they don't feel boring or stupid.It's an unforgettable adventure you must enjoy."
Positive,"This time, I do not need translation."
Positive,monkey with a staff. Game of year

Positive,Simply the best game I have ever played this generation. quality on everything.
Positive,"Just finished platitumed the game in NG+. NG+ was a walk in a breezy park. I basically did a no-spell run, except for Erlang the scared divinity and Broken Shell of the Great Sage (those are on another level). The armour and weapon obtained towards the end of NG were that OP.I was playing on a Steam Deck @30fps. The game was so stable that in my ~60 hour play through, there was no crash whatsoever. And the game was so fun that it was like living in a dream.I cannot recommend the game more. Although I have done it twice, I am going to NG++ and so on, because there are so many possibilities that I want to try, so many mechanics that I have yet to perfect, see through being one of them. See through is satisfying as hell, and OP as hell. And other combinations of spells, martial arts styles, armour and weapons. I see hundreds more hours of fun.And the visuals in this game. I am not good with words. All I can say is that this is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played.Many have complained about the invisible walls in this game. It is not a perfect design. But I’ll take it any day, compared to inadvertently falling to death in Souls games.The game is not perfect. I will give it a solid 9.5/10. As a fan of action-adventure games, this is my GOTY. Highly recommended."
Positive,"Yes I'd recommend it but with a caveat. The story is fascinating. Graphically, it's stunning. Easily the best looking game I've played this year, the models designers should win awards. Soundtrack is also great. I really enjoyed the first three chapters they had a great balance between challenge and difficulty...However, from chapter 4 you start encountering bosses that just don't feel fun to fight. To make matters worse, after encountering one boss and deciding to go get some levels; I wandered into another boss-fight that despawned the first one! I'll be honest that annoyed the hell out of me. Ultimately, if you're excited about playing it go for it. If you're on the fence about buying it or not, my advice is to wait for a sale."
Positive,Cool game! Beet it 3 times. Highly recommended
Positive,"With a tutorial boss named ERLANG, this game forces you to do your best and EXCEL."
Positive,"A Fantastic game, great graphics, no lag on a laptop with Nvidia 3070 and latest studio drivers. Currently on Chapter 2 and enjoying every minute."
Positive,Absolutely amazing and beautiful graphics amazing gameplay and the game makes me sweat Absolutely loving it
Positive,"Absolute masterpiece. Solid GOTY 2024 contender with nothing coming even remotely close.Reject modernity, embrace 16th century Chinese Monkey King."
Positive,Monkey approved ⸉ᘓ◎⃝ᆺ◎⃝ᘐ⸊         🐒🐵🙊🙈🙉
Positive,"its good decent enough, but at some moments its a bit boring"
Positive,Confuscius says you will mash square a million times to find enlightenment.
Positive,Monke does what Monke do.
Positive,god damn it this game is good
Positive,"Solid, disappointed by the ending though, doesn't feel satisfying ending the way it did...really felt like ""The real Wukong was the friends/battles along the way"" and naaaah, I just wanted a big bad to fight as Wukong.Do the secret ending, at least then it's somewhat satisfying doing the secret boss."
Positive,i fw this game so heavy :D
Positive,i love this game
Positive,Wonderful.  A blend of God of War and Souls games.Great entry into the Souls-like formula.  Also great for Dads with little free time!
Positive,"The only thing I find not super satisfying was the invisible walls, everything else was fantastic. Btw, fuck IGN, sweet bb, and any other platforms that attempted to disparage this game."
Positive,"well optimized, fair difficulty, easy to understand UI, breathtaking scenery and most importantly a MONKE with a STICK that just BONKs everything in his way 10/10"
Positive,good gem. good monke monke strong
Positive,MOnke in 4k
Positive,"A surprising gem in a sea of mediocrity.Some minor technical hiccups here and there for the keen eyed, but far less than any of the last i want to say....3 dozen triple A releases.  A game that pushes genre limits with incredible graphics and story.  Well done."
Positive,I shit my pants every time I re-play a boss-fight
Positive,"After spending over 70 hours perfecting my playthrough of Black Myth Wukong, unlocking everything, and taking on all the challenges, I can say the game is a visual masterpiece, but it’s not without its hiccups. The Unreal Engine 5 really shines here every environment, from the lush forests in the opening chapter to the frozen mountains and scorching deserts later on, is breathtaking. The game’s atmosphere and art direction make you want to stop and just take it all in, especially in areas like the Temple Ruins or the visually striking Chapter 5’s snowy landscape.Combat and GameplayThe core combat feels incredibly satisfying, especially when facing off against some of the game’s larger-than-life bosses like Erlang Shen or the Duskveil monster. Each boss has beautifully animated attack patterns, and learning these movements is key to mastering the game. What I loved most is the transformation mechanic, which gives you the ability to switch between various forms mid-battle, adding a lot of depth to the combat system. The way the game pushes you to experiment with different playstyles keeps things fresh even after dozens of hours.However, some aspects of the gameplay fall short. The levels between boss fights can feel bland and linear, with little in the way of meaningful exploration or diverse enemies. While the boss fights are epic, the minor enemies can feel repetitive after a while, and the crafting system for weapons and armor seems almost pointless. There's no real incentive to upgrade gear since the changes are marginal at best. I found myself relying more on skill and transformation abilities than the gear itself.Story and LoreThe story is heavily inspired by Journey to the West, which is fitting for a game centered around Wukong. The cutscenes are beautifully animated and seamlessly blend into the gameplay, offering cinematic moments that are genuinely engaging. That being said, the storytelling can feel fragmented, with important narrative details hidden in cryptic dialogue or lore entries that many players may miss unless they dive deep into the journal system. I found it intriguing, but some might find the pacing and delivery a bit obscure, especially if you're not familiar with the source material.Performance IssuesOne of the most frustrating parts of my experience was the performance. On high-end systems, the game struggles with frame drops and long load times, particularly in more graphically intense areas like dark caves or boss arenas with complex lighting effects. This made certain encounters, especially mid-boss fights, more challenging than they needed to be because of lag spikes. For a game so visually impressive, the lack of optimization was a noticeable downside.Final ThoughtsDespite its shortcomings, Black Myth Wukong is a phenomenal action RPG that offers an immersive journey through Chinese mythology. Its breathtaking visuals, fluid combat, and unique transformation mechanics stand out as its strongest aspects. If you're willing to overlook the fragmented storytelling and performance hiccups, the game is an absolute must-play for fans of the genre. It’s one of those rare games that leaves a lasting impression long after you’ve finished it.This is definitely a game that rewards patience and skill, and I highly recommend giving it a try, especially if you're into deep, mythologically inspired RPGs with a Soulslike feel."
Positive,poor monke die now we monke
Positive,"Combat is lovely, story-line even better. Little buggy but nothing a patch cant fix."
Positive,Good Game = Fun Game YES YES YES!!!
Positive,"First off forget what the game journalists say about this game, this game lives up to the hype. Some people may say that the combat can get repetitive but if you experiment and mix up stances during combat with bosses and mobs it's far from repetitive.The game is definitely challenging but gives you a great sense of achievement when to beat that boss you've been tied down for hours fighting. I recently bought my first ever gaming PC recently and this game came included in it which makes it a great deal haha. To sum it up it's Game Of The Year contender at least"
Positive,"game of the year for sure one of those games you will remember forever,  highly recommend"
Positive,"you'll never reach the banana, if you do not have the courage to climb"
Positive,"This game is most definitely a  Soulslike. As a fan of FromSoftware games, I just find this game too difficult and frustrating. It tips my personal scales of fun vs a challengne to the point where I have completely given up playing it. If you were not expecting such as difficult and controller destroying-in-a-fit-of-pure-rage challenge, give it a miss. If you are a total ""my games must be mind alteringly difficult for me to enjoy them"" fan, you'll probably love it.So, I'm having to change my review to recommended. It is still a frustrating game but I am finally enjoying it. I'm sure there's plenty of rage to come (!) but I finally beat the lake boss and then beat the chapter 1 boss 2nd attempt. It is starting to click and I'm glad I didn't give up."
Positive,"I'd love to write a review, but it crashes before the first cut scene even finishes. Updated drivers etc. Hopefully they get a patch out soon.Update: Played it on my other PC with a 4090 and wow this game is amazing! I've never been a big fan of these types of difficult games like Bloodborne, Elden Ring etc... but something about this has me hooked. The gameplay is very straightforward and very rewarding once you get the hang of it. I spent the majority of my time played on a sub boss at the beginning stages. But by the time I figured out how to beat him, I became much much better at the game. It is a rewarding experience so far and I'm only on Act 1. Gameplay 10/10, Visuals 10/10, Story 8/10, Difficulty 8/10 so far.TLDR; Game is great! 9/10 I recommend you check it out. And don't give up immediately."
Positive,"Few years waiting was really worth it. Graphics are stunning, story is great (I recommend reading Journey to the West or at least getting some summary) and gameplay is really well designed. Game runs (almost) flawlessly on Ryzen 5 3600/RTX 2060 Super on high settings (I didn't try ray tracing). Gameplay is something like God of War but instead of greek or nordic mythology we have chinese one. Basic combat is really simple with a lot of variety provided by spells, stances, transformations and ""summons"" as I call them. Big skill tree allows to make different builds with option to respec at the shrines. As for weapon and armor, mostly we are changing just to stronger gear but special effects on sets make some better for certain bosses.Knowing story behind Wukong and his journey not only gives a lot of context but also provides some knowledge on who-and-why we are fighting, so again - I recommend getting the hang of the original story to enhance your playthrough. As for the game itself we are playing as a monkey looking for Wukong 6 treasures long after he dies at the events in prologue.For me it's easily GOTY and I'm really glad that developers just focused on making hella banger of a game."
Positive,ow ow aaa aaaa
Positive,Oyun gerçekten güzel olmuş sadece oyuna girer girmez MONKE DOESN'T WEAR ANY PANTS söylemeye başlıyorum. Ah internet beni ne hale getirdin...
Positive,its easier then sekiro but still challenging its a good game to play when your bored or in general good graphics and i experienced no bugs so faredit: after the update my game is crashing frequently
Positive,not having intimate knowledge of journey to the west is just a skill issue
Positive,Absolutely worth it !!!
Positive,Shut up and take my money!
Positive,I was paid by the Chinese government to give Black Myth: Wukong a positive review.
Positive,"I really enjoyed this game, recommend it!"
Positive,"Very surprising breath of fresh air, comparable to other Soulslikes such as Lies of P, the game is full of atmosphere and unique Chinese culture while boasting impressive graphics and very fluid gameplay, neatly packed in an immersive and interesting world. It's a very worthy accomplishment for a random dev studio that first showed this game 4 years ago, many people not even thinking it would ever come out."
Positive,"This game was kind of a wild card on release, coming from an unknown Chinese studio with a well-reported big budget. I, like most others, figured I'd bide my time and see if it panned out on release. What we ended up getting is a surprising hit.Pros:* Rides the line between Souls-lite and Spectacle Fighter with its flashiness and cooldown abilities.* Gracefully adapts Journey to the West to the archetypal Souls game plot.* Absolutely gorgeous.* Tons and tons and tons of interesting bosses.* Offers enough abilities to allow for varied combat.Cons:* Cliffs aren't dangerous... until they are. The game usually doesn't let you fall off a cliff by any means, but on occasion there are deadly falls despite that.* Very demanding on my high-ish end hardware (see my profile for specs). Frequently dips from 60s to the 40s. Without DLSS I'd probably be screwed."
Positive,"About 50% of the way through at the moment and this is GOTY for sure. One of the best games I've ever played, and definitely the best game I've played this year. Probably the best looking game I've ever played too. Visually stunning with the gameplay to match. 10/10"
Positive,Oh man what can I say about this game it's amazing! It runs great with my 7800xt it's beautiful the combat is very very tight i wouldn't worry about coming from elden ring to this in fact I think it's the perfect transition it's not as in your face as ER it's more strategic but you can also go crazy and just dodge perfectly which I love all in all instant favorite of the year
Positive,prob game of the year w
Positive,"Fun game, it's a breath of fresh air compared to western games."
Positive,"loved the game, until you fight Wukong, that sucked"
Positive,"it peak asf ngl monkey game cool, ooh ooh ah ah"
Positive,"As a fan of Journey to the West lore and occasional games released about it BAR Dragonball, I found myself invested immediately. The souls like systems are easier to manage being able to reset skills and adjust to a play style that fits you at the moment. The world is beautiful combat is more fast paced akin to Sekiro with parrying and dodging. The seamless way you can go from a battle to a cutscene makes it even more immersive. I am playing with a Sapphire 7700 XT on Ultra settings. After the shaders loaded it had a slight slow start but once Wu Kong jumped that nimbus cloud we were both flying high with no lag or hiccups. I do hope they optimize FSR but for now I say this is another part of my Souls collection."
Positive,game of the year 2024
Positive,"Easily the GOTY for 2024. For someone who gets easily bored by most games today, this one got me enjoying every minute exploring the open world, leveling up and fighting each boss. It's not a perfect game by any means but it is still way better than most and very much playable. 100% recommend if you enjoy single player games with a great story and fun combat mechanics/customizable builds."
Positive,"It's a fantastic game, the graphics are phenomenal, and it is very authentic to Buddhism. I am happy it doesn't shy away from the religious themes of Buddhism and formally represents it in a way that almost no video game medium ever has. I only wish there was a map for us to know where we were going."
Positive,"really good game, but even if you not know certain level of  journey to the west, you will realize it was an unfinished story, game science release a 80% or 70% game to the public, they left many unused resources and some resources redistribute to other place. The unfinished work leads to problems with the plot of the game that I am looking at so far, and the rhythm of the game is not reasonably distributed, and the content behind it is obviously shrunk due to rush. Even so, I'd say it's a good game and it's worth buying. P.S I REALLY NEED MAP DURING PLAYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Positive,GAME OF THE YEAR
Positive,"This is a very well rounded game! Its like a blend of GoW, Ghost of Tsushima and Elden Ring all in one. The story is thought out and combat feels so fluid and unique with being able to change your stances mid fight."
Positive,Perfect Monkey Business!!!!! 🐵🐵🐵
Positive,"Amazing visuals; Not getting punished for failure, not open world (too many of those out imo)!A breath of fresh air, something new and stunning and super fun!Game of the year contender for sure!"
Positive,Best GOTY contender so far.
Positive,not a game.an experience.
Positive,This game is amazing its a must play
Positive,"The first time I picked up a game like this (""souls-like)"", it felt like a roller coaster ride."
Positive,hard as shit dont care about no elden ring its still hard
Positive,Was fun until Pagoda now I just wish i could refund.
Positive,Only issue is the bad optimization. But once you tweak settings. It plays perfect
Positive,"This game makes gaming great again. Can't remember the last single player game I enjoyed this much.The Good: beautiful game, looks polished and runs smoothly, unlike game from certain developers that requires 10 patches on day one to make it playable. The Bad: it's a hard game, got my ass kicked repeatedly :(The ugly: ask me again once I beat chapter one"
Positive,"At 10 hours and having completed two chapters, I think I can write a decent enough review for anyone on the fence. The game is of course visually stunning and the storytelling is excellent and even better if you are aware of Chinese myths.  Bosses are pretty unique for the most part, and while there it's a bit of a boss rush and linear map, there's still a lot of hidden secrets you can look out for. In turn of improvements, as a keyboard and mouse player, this could definitely be better. It would be great to be able to remap the mouse (e.g side buttons) as of right now, there is no options. Keyboard is fine for the most part, albeit I found CTRL for jump a bit difficult to use, not that you really need to jump in the game. I found bosses mostly well-designed, but some movements/hitboxes feel a bit clunky. l sometimes get hit unexpectedly when close and sometimes rolling seems unresponsive. Also some of the spells may sometimes... just not activate, but the cool down will still begin if you get hit during the process. This might be a skill issue on my part, but seems a bit punishing especially with the Immobilise spell. The most annoying part I did find though is probably the AI aggro. They latch on you even when you walk halfway across the map. Sometimes when you want to just attack a boss, you would have to kill the regular mobs first which I find a bit tedious. Would love to have the aggro/deaggro range smaller.Anyhow, don't let this stop you from buying the game."
Positive,"Don't expect elden ring, expect Nioh boss rush mode. This game is something else, looks great, feels smooth, and the worldbuilding and character design has you not even frustrated that toad murdered you ten times. It's delightful in all the ways you want it to be. Is it perfect? Nope, but its fun and we need more games that are just straight up fun."
Positive,A technical and artistic masterpiece
Positive,Beautiful souls like game which respects your time. Suitable for players up for a decent challenge but definitely a beatable game
Positive,Bought this game purely because I wanted to support the developers that literally F@!Ked woke journalism and woke companies.p.s: The game itself is also GOOD.
Positive,"For me at least, the game consistently Crashes or gives a BSOD during Shader Processing. I've tried everything from BIOS Updates, GPU updates and even Reinstalling the game and Verifying the game files. After about 15-20 attempts the same thing happened every time.... Eventually i found a workaround and got the game to play, Right click the game in the steam library and go to Properties/general and type "" -dx11 "" in the advanced launch options to skip the Shader Processing entirely. Anyway, the Game runs great, Plays great and looks even better. Its deserving of its Hype without a doubt. 10/10 GG"
Positive,"The game is a 3/5 for me. I love RPGs but the dodging mechanic and the magnetic hit lock-on for bosses feels so bad. Im Spamming dodge at the moment they attack but the bosses attack immediately after a perfect dodge. What is the purpose of the perfect dodge if you don't get a second to recollect yourself? Or i drink a pot and need to dodge right after but the heal takes too long and you dodge at the wrong time causing to get hit. It just feels like the timing is off. You should be able to dodge cancel and not use up HP flask if dodging while healing. Also, the LONGEST heavy attack of any game i have ever played. The heavy attack feels so bad; you get shit on in the middle of your actual combo. While in mid combo you get half healthed and obviously cant dodge in the middle of attacking... so either do a full combo and get half health-ed or just two light attacks at a time and whittle down the boss... All this (IMO) creates a horrible feel to combat. Unless you hyper farm your character b4 the fights and simply over power a boss you'll just get shit on. Imma play it all the way out and Fk this Tiger one way or another lol. Would recommend just frustrating at times! Good Game overall, Beautiful aesthetics."
Positive,"this is 1000% game of the year, maybe of this decade so far. The dev took big risk introducing so many new concept foreign to the saturated western world and totally crushed it. Growing up with Journey to the West made this game even more impactful to me. Gameplay - 10/10: Smooth. fun and rewarding combat. I never felt bored with combat and gameplay due to COUNTLESS UNIQUE bosses and mob. I've never seen so many variety of things to fight in this game. 80 unique bosses (not counting mobs) CRAZY! Story - 9/10: It's only a 9 because there are so many tribute to journey to the west that sometimes it might be confusing to players new to this world of mythology. However, the story in each chapter are concise and contained with everything tied together at the end. Beautiful story telling.Graphic - 10/10: this needs no explanation. Unreal Engine 5 is KING and was shown off hereArt - 10/10: From the first moments of the game until the credit rolled, you can tell there are so much love and passion put in this game. Devs went above and beyond for things that most people dont think would contribute much to the game but was absolutely game changer. Play and you'll see"
Positive,"You'll find better reviews than this, I'm just here to let you know the hype is real and to thank the DEVS for not cowering to woke fly by night ""journalism""; I went into this game knowing nothing about the mythology and plan on reading the source material after beating this GEM. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
Positive,"Very glad to support a game like this from Eastern developers and also glad they stayed cool and haven't responded to the fake woke shit accusations from the West (IGN). The ""nose ring mafia"" got rekt big time.Otherwise game runs good, with some video settings adjustments. I advise the settings from Daniel Owen (search on YT: ""Black Myth: Wukong Optimized PC Graphics Settings"" and go to 15:40). And then adjust to your GFX Card capability. I also like the chinese audio, with subtitles enabled. More immersive."
Positive,I'm so glad the woke snowflakes lost another battle. best monkey games of all time. Also just a great action game.
Positive,"''No woke culture, just monke king'' ahh moment"
Positive,Really interesting story and very fun. Overall graphics look really great.
Positive,"is good, monkey hit with stick"
Positive,"Was going to wait a few weeks for all the bugs to get fixed but after the insane attacks on the studio with woke false narratives, I decided to buy it now just to rub it in their faces. Amazing looking game, some of the best graphics to date with the full path tracing. Gameplay is good too, heard the bugs dont start hitting until after chapter 2 so hopefully they get em patched before i get there but either way, I heard they arent game breaking so im not too worried about it. Def buy it if you're on the fence and like new god of war and/or devil may cry."
Positive,"Absolutely blown away by this! Definitely one of the best games to come out this year, if not thee best! Graphics, game play, story, characters .. it's got it all! And the best bit of this game is, it pisses off the woke community.."
Positive,"Just finished act 2, look at my play time.This game got me hooked, and searching every nook and crany to make sure i get those sweet secret bosses,and my build is coming together so well i'm starting to bully mobs, while i still get bullied by bosses.A perfect balance."
Positive,"Since Black Myth Wukong came out I started to read about buddhism more and more, I felt somewhat relieved and perceiving things more differently. Idk man Black Myth Wukong is a woke game, it woke me, enlightened that karma isn't the only wheel spinning in our life and we have to welcome adversities because adversity is an opportunity for changes not trying to run away. Take for example, Angulimala, he was a reformed buddhist, because of his past that he killed so many people, If that moment his mind and determination weren't firm and invulnerable he would've not known about karmic fruit that he have sown for his past action therefore, he would've not attained Nirvana. Buddha had admitted that Karma isn't something that even he can't intercept and we should let it run its course. Be glad that karma comes early so that in the after life, we could attain Nirvana."
Positive,All the boss fights feel really epic and unique. Exploring is rewarded with actually good loot. All of the areas are beautiful and mysterious. 10/10 game
Positive,You would definitely love this game.
Positive,The game is exactly like the trailer they showed years ago... even better when you play it.
Positive,"Greate Souls-like combat. The game is a bit more linear like Dark Souls, not of exploration like Elden Ring. However the core gameplay is so fun, combat isn't hard but its a bit complex, and epicly fun."
Positive,"Combat amazing, gameplay and graphics amazing, storyline amazing.  100% Would recommend."
Positive,"10/10For those who have been experiencing crashes, it’s highly likely that you are using 13th or 14th-generation Intel processors, such as the i9-14900K. This CPU is causing crashes—not the game—and it affects not only games but also browsers and other applications.To temporarily ""fix"" this, go to your BIOS settings and turn off Turbo Boost. In my case, when the CPU runs below 3 GHz, it doesn’t crash."
Positive,I have two very potent hosts to play this game ( ryzen9 64G 1TB NVME and a Radeon pro w770  / Ryzen 7 32GBb 1TB nvme and radeon 580X ) but as of now I was not able to play the game  ( Fedora 42 or Windows 10 ) some error happens and the link it gives is very obscure without a proper action to a solution or workaround/ lets see if I get evolved in the next days.  To put a real review I will have to play it first...
Positive,"Really good game.Great looking..Great gameplay.I’m finding it fun and addictive easy in places and difficult in others..but I’m enjoying the gameplay that much I’ve struggled through the harder times with enjoyment more than frustration.It runs very smoothly also,although I do have a higher end PC.I’m finding it plays great on MnK as I don’t like the controller..but for some reason key binds are only for a set amount of keys and not the whole keyboard (which is my only complaint)"
Positive,"Not playable. Crash even before the loading screen. No useful information given Tried compatible mode and upgrading version card drives. Not using Intel cpu.Update: problem solved by using steam tool in game properties: ""Verify the file integrity. ""Good game so far. It's much like the Sekiro, but a little bit easier."
Positive,Thank you DEV for bringing my childhood memories back when I'm 40
Positive,"Très bon jeu, différent, asser difficile quand même. Mais il vaut vraiment la peine.J'y ai joué avec claver souris et c'est vraiment la meilleur façon de jouer au jeu étonnement."
Positive,We can now add great games to delicious food and pretty women as things to thank China for.
Positive,beautiful game fun boss rush literally 10/10
Positive,"Great game -- tons of style, very slick.Bosses can be hit or miss in terms of telegraphed attacks.You can respec for free at any shrine, but a dozen hours in, and there are very few gear options so far. This is like playing an awesome B movie."
Positive,"Combat is fun, animations are a bit clunky and tour attacks have a HUGE windup. Spells are very interesting and fun.The level design and exploration are horrible. There are invisible walls everywhere, It's a pity cause although exploration itself isn't fun at all there a very good incentives to do so.Great enemy variety. Some bosses are much better than others.History is incomprehensible without previous knowledge. Although I like how convoluted it is. May check on the original novel after this. I love your boar buddy.7,5/10."
Positive,"Amazing game. I figured, if I could beat this,  I could beat ANY game....Now I really want to get back into my backlog after beating this  and really want to buy Elden Ring and Lies of P. This was a wonderful introduction to the Souls-Bourne genre. The graphics are amazing, the story is engaging, the controls are solid, and the feeling of accomplishment is amazing. The game got me back into games."
Positive,"Very fun Souls-Like. Return to Monke. Hit with whappity-stick. I really like the fluidity of combat and the freedom to experiment with your builds. You can respec your character for free whenever you want with no consequences and actually test different playstyles freely. Also, you can pause! I have a toddler so that is a huge plus!Game is fun, challenging without feeling overwhelming. Definitely not the hardest souls-like but still plenty of learning to do. Great game with fun and challenging combat."
Positive,"Having finally beaten the game I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is one of the best new games this year. The combat is great. At the start of the game it's easy to get fooled into thinking the combat doesn't have much variety, but the further into the game you get, the more items you unlock, the more you level up, the more the combat system really comes together. You can change your weapon stance to switch between different heavy attacks and other combos, you have a lot of different spells that can completely change the way you approach combat, and there are several transformations that change your moveset entirely. You can even customize your healing in multiple ways, which is a really nice addition. By the end of the game I had several different ""builds"" I could switch between depending on the situation, which is helped by the fact that the game lets you respect all your upgrades for free at any time, which is something more games should do.The game's difficulty is at a pretty fair level. It is much easier than a lot of the games it gets compared to, like Dark Souls or Sekiro, but it has some boss fights that are challenging even to a veteran of the genre. Don't come into this game expecting to overcome anything like you do in Sekiro, but expect to be pushed harder than your average action game. I have not explored a lot of the side content yet, but the few optional bosses I encountered were the hardest fights in the game. I saw some people complaining about the final boss being too hard, but I thought it was easily the game's best fight and is the perfect difficulty level.Graphics are not very important to me when it comes to how much I like a game, so all I'll say about Wukong's graphics is that they are among the best I've ever seen. Not enough to affect my opinion on the gameplay, but very good and is surprisingly well optimized considering that this is the studio's first AAA game. I was even able to get it running fairly well on steam deck, but I would not really recommend playing it on there if you are wanting to play at 60fps or graphics are important to you. Only bringing that up to say how well the devs did at optimizing the game especially considering it's in Unreal 5."
Positive,"This is game is impressive, but has it's flaws. I'm mostly impressed with the enemy variety. There is a constant flow of cool, creative bosses. The combat has grown on me. It took several hours before I started to love it. The skill tree continues to expand, even after 40+ hours. The story is foreign and confusing. However, it is interesting. There are a ton of lore videos on YouTube that are fun to dive into. I'm excited to finish. NG+ should be cool too."
Positive,Great game really refreshing
Positive,"Super polished, well done bossbattler that hooks you in! 10 of 10, and that says something coming from a 39 year old that are bored of games that are either not competative, coop or with some sort of interesting new mechanics. Black Myth is stunning, runs well on older equipment and a pleasure to play! Maybe a tad to difficult sometimes, and thats just because I got kids and not all day to play any more :D"
Positive,"The game showcases next-generation graphics, and its good optimization allows it to deliver excellent graphics and frame rates on a 3060 graphics card. The animation of the boss battle is very impressive, and the post-chapter animations are a pleasant surprise"
Positive,"A fantastic game with uniquely designed combat mechanics, a profound cultural background. Playing this game requires some understanding of Chinese culture or at least some interest in it. If you've read <Journey to the West>, a classic Chinese novel from the Ming Dynasty, you'll find the gameplay incredibly immersive. It's a rare gem of a game, especially considering it's the company's debut title. Despite minor technical flaws, I would still give it a perfect 10 out of 10 rating. Positive, absolutely."
Positive,"This game is DEFINITELY WORTH THE BUY. Fun action combat that can be considered more like an easy Sekiro game than souls-like with what some people may think. The music is awesome and it feels like you are experiencing Chinese opera music. Also excellent game performance on a 5800x3d and 4070 getting 90fps avg on DLSS set to 100, Frame Gen enabled, Raytracing set to max with a mix of medium - very high settings. The environment of chapter one which I've completed as of the review is EXCELLENT.Best of all, this game DOES NOT HAVE DEI."
Positive,"I refunded Black Myth Wukong because I am just not feeling it, I was expecting it to be an ARPG like the Amazing Final Fantasy 16 but sadly this game can't decide if it wants to be a souls game or just a hack and slash with RPG elements. Visuals look amazing but sadly you can't really explore anything due to invisible walls the combat mechanics feel loose and janky I definitely feel like this game is riding high on the overhype train. The overwhelming positive reviews here on steam with very little play time is quite concerning I myself only played for 1 hour had the game crash on me right after the opening fight. To be honest I was experiencing the honeymoon effect while playing it but while I was sitting at work all I could think about was playing the Final Fantasy 16 demo more because it's dam near perfect for an ARPG.I am running on a 7800x3d 7900XTX and still having performance issues. I refunded it for now maybe I will buy it again on sale but I have a bunch of games coming up that I am more interested in playing.I am now 11 hours into Black Myth Wukong still has some balance issues with some of the bosses but I am starting to believe that these few bosses are designed to be challenging as they are the main area bosses. leveling up seems pretty straight forward the first chapter doesn't have much of a farming area but chapter 2 does. i highly recommend this game."
Positive,"You'll like this one, it's got monkey.For real though, this game is actually GAME CHANGING. The level of design, the variety of characters you come across and the amount of bosses you can choose to take on is insane. Plenty of upgrades whether that be for abilities or armor you can find from quests or craft from shrines, collecting essence from bosses with the ability to change into them during fights, so many ways to choose your playstyle. Whoever has been underestimating this game from the start must've been very let down because Black Myth: Wukong exceeds all expectations. It's not much of a souls-like apart from it being a boss rush type of thing just like Elden Ring or any others souls game but more an RPG adventure, it's linear when it needs to be but opens up so much more allowing free range when it absolutely can. The game seems fairly lengthy, several chapters with plenty of area to explore once you reach chapter 2 and being about 30+ hours in I'm still stuck on chapter 3.Definitely my Game of the Year. Period."
Positive,"100% in ~53 hours. 2 runs required   1st = 44 hours (quests, items, exploration)   2nd (NG+) = 9 hours (clean up and items required from secret area in chapter 5)Great game! NG+ felt more like a victory lap than a masochistic experience; which was wonderful. If you plan to 100% be aware that some drop rates are abysmal and will require a significant time investment (Tender Jade Lotus, Undying Vine, and a couple of curios) ."
Positive,master peace of art
Positive,This game is really awesome.
Positive,"Amazing story, outstanding graphics, very intuitive leveling system and a decent difficulty. must play!"
Positive,till now 10/10
Positive,"So good... so, so, so, good."
Positive,"Been waiting for this game since i saw the very first trailer way back in 2020, and man it lives up to my expectations. 10000000000000000% recommend"
Positive,Initial impressions were Wow and my final impressions stayed the same. What an amazing journey. 10/10 GOTY.
Positive,exceeded my expectations!
Positive,"Game rocks, IGN doesn't know a good game if it hit them in the head."
Positive,Extremely pretty looking game and the game play is very fun
Positive,"This game was a blast! I enjoyed every detail and every enemy I have fought so far.. The only issue I've encountered was the sound delay, it bugs me and it kinda fine tho. Gameplay was fire! I love every second this game gives to me.Edit: I finished the game and this game has touched me from flesh to soul, I enjoyed every seconds that the game has given to us. Definitely a 10/10 Game."
Positive,"It's my favourite game this year. If you have read/watched ""Journey to the West"", you'll feel more immersive when playing the game. Also don't get me wrong. Even though you don't know the background, Black Myth: Wukong is still an exceptional action RPG. Would recommend it to people who love Sekiro or Nioh."
Positive,"Challenging, cinematic fights. Responsive controls but a bit slower pace than a souls type game. More timing based and no parrying only perfect dodges. Hard, but enjoyable. Chinese language with english subs, using a controller.Boss fights are hard, game seems linear but plenty of pockets to climb around in for alternate fights and loot. Combat took a bit to figure out the core mechanic and there's no tutorial. Skill tree and equipment sets give nice variability."
Positive,"Took my interest even tho I was never for some reason souls/god of war,star wars player and this looks like mix of all. Its not easy for me since I lack experience but getting used to it and trying with controller. Deff playable even for newcomers in this kind of gendres. Game running smooth. No lags, stutters or fps drops. From my POV good work from technical side and worth of try - maybe in end I will like it that much that I will try another similiar games in this kind playstyle."
